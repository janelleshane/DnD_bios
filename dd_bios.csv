He was given a post as the watchman, scout, and guardian in charge of keeping the village safe. He did his job well, but the gargoyles the village had been at war with managed to find the one thing Erryt couldn’t see coming. They triggered a massive rockslide on the mountain, crushing the entire town and its inhabitants. Erryt saw no others escape the disaster, and his eyes “are as keen as they come! Keen as they come! BRAWK!” Seeing he was vastly outnumbered, Erryt fled, and has been on the wing for days, having just finally lost the last of the gargoyles chasing him."9/18/2017 8:06:59,Katyusha,Aarakocra,Cleric,"Real name !kã_usaLives in fantasy Soviet Union, she and Valentina are an ethnic minority. Some Aarakocra came there a long time ago and learned reindeer herding from local tribesmen.

Went to university to become a healer-priest for her tribe. Met her girlfriend there, but her girlfriend Valentina (_alentao) went to fight in the Great Patriotic War.

Now it has been two more years and Valentina has not come back yet. So Katyusha wanders with her dog, Maraka, to find her lost love. Katyusha and Valentina had rings made together when Valentina left for the war. The gems in the rings glow faintly to let them know the other is alive and well. (The gem stops glowing if taken off their finger or if they die) However, it does not point to where they are, so there is no indicator other than local tales. (Valentina probably got taken as a prisoner of war or something idk)"9/18/2017 7:29:01,Surkiikri,Aarakocra,Monk,"Surkiikri was firstborn of the ruling family of the Mistcliffs Aarakocran colony in Chult. Tradition, though not law, dictates that the noble title pass to the firstborn, but Surk was passed over for his younger sister, Krilahk, a far more charismatic leader. Surk initially turned to the monastery to hone his martial skills, but there he also found belonging in the simply life away from the headaches of responsibility.When word came to the monastery of new rumors of a piece of the Rod of Seven Parts, Surk felt a deeply rooted sense of responsibility stir for the people he was born, if not chosen, to lead. He left his new home in search of this artifact with the blessing of his order going with him. Surk lives a highly conflicted inner life. He is content, happy even, with his life as a monk, though he still feels keenly the sting of not being good enough in the eyes of the Elder Council. However, deeper still, lies the truth that he never wanted to be the tribal leader. He remembers the ascension of his sister to the throne with relief mingled with guilt. This conflict of desires churns underneath the generous and altruistic attitude Surk presents to the world."9/18/2017 8:17:14,Azriel,Aasamar,Paladin,He was raised the isles in a family of nobles who had close ties to the gods and there angelic guardians.

Her unusual skin coloring (from being an aasimar) matched some of the descriptions of Heironeous, so the priests and paladins at the temple considered her to be blessed. She became a paladin herself and after successfully battling against forces of the evil god Hextor, she was assigned on a new mission to serve as a diplomat to a newly discovered land across the sea."9/18/2017 9:19:14,Ambriel Falafel,Aasimar,Paladin,"Ambriel, the haunted one, is on a quest to vanquish evil. Once an upstanding paladin, she made the mistake of reading an Eldrich tome. Despite destroying the tome, its words still echo in her mind, and she has slowly been losing her grip on her sanity and her alignment. Now, she clings to her mission of taking down the greatest evil, hoping for redemption, although she no longer believes she deserves it. Ambriel has fallen, and the only thing that keeps her going is knowing she's taking evil down with her. Also, she doesn't read anymore. Books are as untrustworthy as people."9/18/2017 7:32:19,Aldea,Aasimar,Cleric (Tempest),"Aldea was born in a kingdom where magic was everywhere, wizards ruled, and lacking it herself, she and her family were lower-class. At some point a wealthy nobleman recognized her noble blood and decided he wanted her as a mistress. She rejected him, and he had her family tried and executed for treason, magic disintegrating them on the spot. But he left her alive, still obsessed. Terrified, Aldea begged for any god that would listen to help her, and one did: Valkyr, the god of Storms and Sailors.

She fled the judgement of the elves and her family to raise her child in Greenest.As young Mev grew, Althaea came to realize that there was something of the Divine about her child. She was not surprised, then, when, at the age of 8, an angel appeared and requested custody of Mevralen for a decade, to train him for his destiny as a holy protectors of all.""A decade is not so long, my dear Mev. Go with her - I will be here when you return.""The angel's name was Myllandra, and as the angel quested throughout Faerun, she raised Mev in the way of the gods. She taught him of people and of the divine, and trained him in the tools of violence so he could protect the peoples of Faerun. She tempered his troubling violent streak, and taught him the importance of compassion, mercy, and understanding.As the end of of Mev's training drew near, Myllandra taught him of the mystic senses of a paladin... and Mev received a vision of Greenest in flames, his mother in danger. Against the warnings of Myllandra, Mev abandoned his training, travelling to Greenest with his Paladin Oath of Protection incomplete."9/18/2017 15:44:33,Zea,Aasimar,Cleric,"She was born to a pure blooded Aasimar family, and lived with her father and two younger sisters. Her father was very much a hippy, he constantly preached the word of Pan, and her sisters always did charity work whenever they could. Zea however became very much the opposite. While she went to church with her family without complaint, she eventually grew tired of having to praise someone she didn't even know or care about.That was when, at aged 36, she moved out to live on her own. She struggled a lot with money and debts so she, very hesitantly, began to praise the goddess Lyvalia. Very soon she became someone with a silver tongue, and was able to swindle praise and wealth out of near any common folk. But she wasn't happy, she was back at square one, worshipping someone she doesn't care for. So she researched, and found people called ""Separatists"", who can go against their gods and follow their own path, while still getting the benefits from their old god and staying in good graces.Now, aged 90, she strolls around miserable towns, praising herself as a powerful goddess. She shows off her holy flames and beauty like she has nothing to lose (with the occasional ""Praise to Lyvalia"" since she still needs to spread her word to get her benefits), and installs utter terror to those who stray from her."9/18/2017 16:56:33,Abaewin Toredas,Aasimar,Wizard,"BackstoryAbaewin Toredas lives a hard life. Born in Nybor, then leaving as soon as he was 10, to a small town in the forest, he was already unfamiliar with his surroundings. Descended from fallen angels, he never truly fit in. All his life, people had ridiculed him because of his silver hair. They all said it was grey. Abaewin’s parents were never around, always leaving him to his own devices.When he was 20, he would wander in dark places. He didn’t realize they were dark, but it was a place where he could get some peace and quiet, away from other people.One day, he saw a woman in the woods, and she seemed to be trying to hide in plain sight for some reason. He said “Hello”, and she jumped and said “How can you see me?”. Abaewin said “What do you mean? It’s not that dark, and you’re not trying to hide.” The woman responded “What do you mean not that dark? I can barely see! Oh… are you one of those people descended from fallen angels?” “Yes”, replied Abaewin, “But I don’t seem to have gotten anything out of it, other than my gray hair”. The woman said “My name’s Zinnoara Galantara, and I might be able to teach you a thing or two. You seem to need some guidance. Or education.” Abaewin responded “My parents aren’t around much… I guess I could learn from you.” (Abaewin wasn’t exactly street smart...) Abaewin stayed with Zinnoara for quite some time, hermited away in the woods. Because of this, he wanted more. He had tasted power, as a young child, and wanted his freedom once more. He wanted it all.His parents died when he was gone, but he never found out, as he didn’t have any love for his parents, not understanding why they were never home. But they were good people, and a large group of Divs had stormed the town, slaughtering the whole thing. The Divs were evil, and knew that Abaewin’s parents were Peris. Abaewin took after his ancestors, though, instead of his parents. The fallen angels. If not for that, the Divs would have come long ago. However, if Abaewin had been there, he would have been killed. Anyways, Abaewin stayed and trained with Zinnoara for 50 years. His appearance didn’t change too much, but Zinnoara grew old and died. He learned much about the world he was in, but was just starting down the path of the arcane arts when Zinnoara died. He mourned her for quite some time, then left to find a new path for himself. As he travelled, he came across a group of Sczarni. They adopted him into the family, thinking he was a normal human wizard, and he travelled with them for some time. They gifted him a pet, a small snake. Abaewen named it Meeka. 10 years later, Abaewin had learned much from his adopted family, including a few family friends in a town called Sandpoint. This turned out to be good, as one night, the family was attacked by bandits, and Abaewin was driven out, distracting the bandits long enough for the family to flee. Abaewin decided to travel to Sandpoint, as it was the only place he knew of where he could be safe. When he arrived at Sandpoint, he found the family friend, a ruthless thug named Jubrayl Vhiski at the Fatman’s Feedbag. Abaewin stayed at the Feedbag for 6 years, doing odd jobs around the place. During his stay, he learned about the locals, and a few tricks of the trade."9/17/2017 23:07:32,Jasna Bek,Aasimar,Fighter,"Jas grew up in the city of Vier as the daughter of a dyer and a hunter of exotic beasts. Her parents were loving and her home cramped but comfortable. With both a keen sense of justice and uncommon size and strength from a young age, Jas spent a lot of her childhood beating up neighborhood bullies. Her peers regarded her with a mixture of fear and respect, the proportions of which varied depending on how likely they were to earn her ire. She didn’t make friends easily, and her clear divine heritage only increased her distance from the other children. Although she’s not naturally a solitary person, Jas learned to entertain herself, whether by reading history or honing her physical skills.When she was 16, Jas chased down a burglar who had stolen from a neighbor and hit him so hard that, in the middle of a public street, he flew back and slammed into a wall. She didn't kill him, but it was frightening enough that she and her parents decided she should join the military to receive training and learn discipline.The military suited Jas--she loved the hierarchy, the routine, the sense of doing what was right. As someone highly athletic, committed to following the rules, and with a commanding presence, she excelled. She spent ten years in the army, rising from teenage enlisted soldier to officer.Just before her next promotion, however, a scandal broke. The country Vier is located in, Mohrany, used to be united with their neighbor, Sacreden. The Sacredi ambassador, it turned out, had been secretly gathering intelligence and compiling lists of Mohranian citizens who would be eligible for a draft (the draft is currently not in use in Mohrany, but used to be, and is highly controversial). When this was discovered, a fellow soldier got ahold of the information and anonymously leaked it to the public. This was illegal, a clear breach of the code of conduct and of confidentiality, and Jas worried that making public the treachery and subsequent embarrassment of a sometimes unfriendly ally would cause a war, one in which she or her fellow soldiers would be among the first to die. She took it upon herself to investigate, tracked down the whistleblower, and brought him up on charges in military court.Then, in court, the goddess that Jas served as an aasimar and as a paladin--Cio, goddess of law, justice, and order--judged her to be in the wrong and cast her down, stripping her of her angelic powers. Jas fell.Everything collapsed quickly after that. So publicly humiliated, Jas was quietly encouraged to leave the military, and she did. Her loss of faith in Cio, spurred by an inability to understand how a goddess of law could take the side of a lawbreaker over a devoted servant, caused her to lose her paladin powers. She spent a year and a half meandering through Vier's worst dive bars, drinking and getting into fights. She made a few friends, but more enemies.Jas hit rock bottom when she realized there wasn't a bar in her rotation that she hadn't been kicked out of for fighting. She vowed to clean up her act, and spent time re-learning how to wield a sword without divine power behind it. Soon, she was good enough to look for jobs, and was eventually taken on by the Rana family, new nobility who didn't care about the optics of her past.She's been working for the Ranas for a year now, and she likes them a lot, but recently she's begun to be suspicious of their adult son, Ere. Figuring out what he gets up to when he disappears might just lead her down a strange path."9/18/2017 17:32:23,Solveig,Aasimar,Sorcerer,"One night Nissanai, an Iroran hermit dwelling in the Menador Mountains, gave shelter – and eventually other comforts – to a mysterious traveler who vanished from her tower the next morning, leaving no footprints in the snow. When she birthed fraternal triplets the following autumn she recognized them immediately for the Idyllkin that they were and felt their names whispered to her by the providence of the Heavenly realms. Recognizing both the great blessing and responsibility laid upon her, the lone sage set about raising the three girls in a manner befitting their heritage. She lay all of her learning as a scholar of the Master of Masters at their disposal and brought them up knowing endless learning and love. 	Nissanai's efforts did not go to waste. The eldest cleaved to the holiness of her god, vowing to protect all good-hearted seekers of knowledge who crossed the treacherous mountain passes. The middle daughter focused on Irori's aspect of honorable self-perfection and enlightenment with a monk's dedication. Then there was Solveig, who was nothing like her sisters and like her mother least of all. For while she respected Irori, she had no patience for the Master of Masters' stern teachings; no patience for anything at all, really. The windy mountains in which she was born infused her with their power, but she had no interest in perfecting her magic through scholarly study. Worldly learning bored her no less. Indeed, the only non-fiction books in her mother's vast library that could hold her interest were military treatises and manuals on hand-to-hand combat, leaving her with a wide array of technical knowledge but little understanding of its practical application. Frequently coming up the loser in sparring matches with her more martially-rigorous sisters never curbed Solveig's enthusiasm, however.	When Nissanai passed away at peace with the life she'd led, the girls each felt the blessing their mother had on the day of their birth. They knew the time had come to leave their mountain home and bring the good their mother had brought them up believing in to the troubled outside world. For her part, Solveig knows she is part of a great plan, but worries little about what her next move will be, preferring to let her journey happen as it happens. She rarely plans ahead, getting by on a mix of charm, guile, and bluster. She dresses impractically, flirts recklessly, and spends money without even thinking. She has used her magic to fortify her against the harsh climate of her home constantly rather than learn to cope with it practically, with the unintended side effect that her natural Celestial resistance against certain elements has atrophied away to nothing. But for all her flaws, her heart is pure and full of fearsome and protective love. She does not know what cause for which her Celestial father sired her, but she knows that when she finds it she will defend it with every last drop of her Agathion blood.	At 5'11”, Solveig is taller than either of her sisters, with proportions improbable for one so slender. Despite her willowy build, her heavenly heritage endows her with unexpected speed, strength, and stamina. The white stripes on her skin are easily mistaken for body paint, but are in fact pigment as natural as the stripes of a zebra or tiger. Less subtle marks of her heritage are hair a shade of red not found in nature (which lightens to radiant blonde during times of heavy magic use) and eyes the color of electrum coins. Easily mistaken for a woman of low morals and social class, Solveig is more than happy to use her appearance to her advantage right up until the moment when her quarterstaff begins breaking greedy hands and knocking lecherous heads."9/18/2017 18:54:20,Lydia Fallon,Aasimar,Weird Musician Bard,"You don't want to hear about me. I'm not very interesting. I can do interesting things and say interesting things, but listening to me talk about me isn't very interesting. The interesting person you want to hear about is my mother.You may know here. Well, not personally. But you might know her name. Amelia Grace, the Lady Scarlet, singer, mage, musician, magician, muse-gician. One of the most sought after performers in… in… I'm not sure. I don't do well with names and places. Some big, important… thingy.Maybe the city. Maybe an empire. It's hard to remember, as I was very small at the time, so I would be unlikely to fully recall even if I hadn't had my head cut apart and put back together two or three or twenty five times.It's very tingly. Kind of refreshing to feel the fresh air blowing over your thoughts.Mother was not one to cling to fame and fortune with every fiber of her being like some people would. Her life was music and her life was magic, and sometimes when she had time her life was me.She was always looking into new things, and old things, and old things that were so old that they had been forgotten about and thus had become new again. And one of these things was what would come to be called the Song of Life.Said to be sung by the very gods themselves when they brought the world into being, through manipulation of the song one could change the growth of crops, affect the breeding of animals, make creatures grow faster, make them stronger, make them faster, make them tougher, make them different.Make them never die.Mother traced the echoes of the song, heard them in her dreams. Followed them to a temple in the middle of wilderness, buried beneath sand and soil of the centuries in a place where even the oldest writings say nothing about anyone ever having lived there.And deep down in the dark, in that unspeakably ancient temple to an unspeakable being of unspeakable power who was unspeakably ancient when the gods were born, she drilled a teeny, tiny hole in reality and for a few brief moments heard something singing the Song itself. Not merely an echo.She made the hole go away and fled the temple, never to return. Knowing to what extent the Song could be put to use.But people were listening. Always listening. Trying to understand the echoes of the Song of Life.So when they heard a few moments of actual singing they took advantage.Just a little school of magic and music out in the countryside. Not particularly important. Not until they found that could keep things alive, keep them healthy, keep them from dying from old age indefinitely.Learn how to Sing, learn the notes, the chords, the tones, the tempos to the Song of Life. Sing the right words in the right ways in the right keys and live forever. Sing it loud enough, sing it long enough, and no part of you dies.There's a term for that. When bits of you that are supposed to die don't, when they keep on living when they shouldn't. It's called cancer. It is not a fun way to die. It is an even fun less way to remain alive.And they couldn't stop. They had bettered themselves such that their bodies always sang the songs, forever to life, never to die.And soon the song spread beyond them. Their mere presence making things grow, making things live, making things never die.Illnesses are alive. Diseases are alive. Plagues are alive. The places in the world that are crammed to the brim with life, the grand cities, the fertile rainforests, they are places where contagions thrive.Those who sought to never die screamed and wailed in their agonies as their bodies were consumed by virulent sickness. Healing, infecting, rotting, and healing again in an endless cycle of consumption.Not even the slightest bit of them was allowed to die, not even one hair made to fall away from their heads. They grew, bloated, warped, twisted, becoming less beings and more locations, living rooms, buildings, factories of flesh and bone, belching forth abominations.It was to this landscape of carnal horror that Mother returned to. And she purged it with fire. Purged it until the valley was glass.Father was having troubles with the… king? Emperor? Duke? Count? Well, the thing pretending to be him. Some creature was wearing the old king's skin and hiding inside it. Father stayed behind, while Mother took me and we went away.Away to a pretty little valley filled with simple farmers, remote wilderness, and narrow, easily watched canyons on either side as the sole entrance where she could place guardian beasts just in case the agents of the Skinmask King came calling.And then one day they did. Once again in search of the Song of Life and its power. Wanting to make perfect soldiers. Immortal soldiers. Undying soldiers.The King sent his blackest of knights, who slew my mother's dragon, came to the town, burned the town when Mother would not give them what they wanted.And then Mother did.Mother sang the Song of Life for them, and then the misty valley was no more.It was no longer part of the world.It was where She dwells. Not the composer of the song, but the singer. It's loudest, longest singer who has grown a world's chorus worth of voices in the eternities she has spent, cast between worlds. She was not supposed to live, but she could not die. So she simply was.In an eternal emptiness there is infinite room to grow, where years are like seconds and seconds are like years.She gave them what they wanted.And they killed her for it.Mother fought them, of course. And they died. And Mother died.But She brought them back. To watch them. To study them. To experiment with them. Everyone, everything, animal, vegetable, and mineral in that valley.She cut us apart, put us back together, saw how we worked with other parts. She was curious, wanting to learn. She didn't get new things to experiment on very often, and certainly not in such large numbers.She found Mother the most interesting, and the most malleable. Mother was already filled with Her song, after all, and She could manipulate her almost as well as She could warp and twist Herself.She could cut cut cut away the bad parts, keep us normal, make sure that we remained fully functional and intact even as she hacked us to pieces and put us back together.After a few seconds and a few decades Mother had a moment of lucid clarity where her mind was her own and not merely an extension of She Who Thrives Between. Her body, however, was another story. She lifted me up, drilled a bigger hole in reality, and pushed me through, closing it upon the part of herself that was carrying me.I left yesterday a little girl, and came back this morning as a grown… mmm, with all the changes, all the bestial alterations, would I still be classified as a woman, do you think? Perhaps if I had a few more scales and a bit more snout I would be called a grown dragoness.I don't have my mother's gift for magic. I cannot cast spells, summon beasts, and bind creatures to my will as she did. And for this I am thankful, as it means that I cannot truly sing the Song of Life that can cause such horrors upon the world. I don't know the words.I think Mother cut the words out of my head when she was taking me apart and putting me back together, made to act as a puppet with Her hand inside.I can make living things listen to me, I can change them. I can make them dance to my tune.Music can only suggest a mood, it takes words to state the way that something truly is.I can't do that. I don't want to do that. I won't do that.I will use the tune, but I'll be using my own lyrics, thank you very much.Have you ever realized that you'd be really, really cute with a tail, by the way?Here, let me show you..."9/18/2017 17:15:31,Andromeda,Aasimar ,Cleric,"Andromeda is an aasimar born to two moon elves. Born intersex, Andromeda identifies as agender, and worships Salune. As a child, they were quite petulant and thought themself smarter than everyone else. This did not help with the constant bullying for strange looks, but Andromeda maintains that they are merely superior and everyone is jealous. As they reached their young adult years, they began to feel a spiritual pull, though they were unsure to what. First, they researched. Having no success, they travelled in nearby villages visiting temples of all sorts. Much to their frustration, the pull remained though they felt nothing at the temples. After many years of research and many visits to temples, Andromeda finally came home. Soon, they found that the shrine ot Salune called their name, and there found their patron diety.  This is the only instance where Andromed will admit to being blind and stubborn, though they insist looking elsewhere for a god to worhsip was part of their spiritual journey to Salune.These days, Andromeda travels from town to town assisting those who worhsip Salune. They are in the protection domain, and often extend this to anyone, regardless of which god or godes sthey swear loyalty to.

Her first memory was a sudden awakening on a dirty workshop table with a grease-covered ratfolk, holding a saw blade, stepping back in shock. Once he, and his benefactors, realized that she wasn't going to be an easy source of parts, they decided on another way to make money off of her.And that's how she met with Redtooth, leader of Redtooth's Raiders. Redtooth made her an offer; in exchange for her fighting for Redtooth's Raiders in the Scrapwall arena, the Raiders would keep her take care of her and once they had made enough money off of her, they would help her find out more about how she ended up in Scrapwall, including the details of how she had ended up on that scrapyard table.For lack of better options, and knowing a that a 'no' would probably land her back on that workshop table, the android accepted.As the months passed, the android, now going by Sigil, a name taken from the sole legible glyph she found on her body, ""S(1)- G(1)-L"",  rose through the rankings in the arena. She was an immediate source of profit for the Raiders, as there was easy money in betting on the newcomer against the tried and true arena fighters. But between her bursts of unnatural rage and the claws Sigil found herself inexplicably equipped with, she made quick work of the various opponents she was pitted against. Sigil quickly became accustomed to these fights, and even began to draw pride over her prowess in the arena and the strength she displayed. Over time however, as her strength became known, there were few who were still willing to fight against her in the arena, and even more crucially, even fewer who were willing to bet against her.Though Sigil had been focused on fulfilling her side of the bargain with the Raiders, she had still made a few acquaintances among the residents of Scrapwall. In a place where people would pounce on a perceived moment of weakness, these friendships were a rare treasure. It was one of these friends, Dinvaya Lanalei, who let her know of some troubling rumors being circulated. It seemed Redtooth and the rest of the Raiders were growing dissatisfied with the diminishing returns Sigil was producing for them in the arena. There was talk among the less cautious Raiders that Sigil would soon be invited to a meeting among the various gangs, and that some high-end cybernetics might be making their way to the market shortly thereafter.Seeing which way the winds were blowing in Scrapwall, Sigil began assembling her few belongings surreptitiously. Late that evening, she made her way to Redtooth's favored resting place and confronted her directly. After some bluster, countered a swift application of pressure to Redtooth's throat, the gang leader admitted that the Raiders were planning on getting one last piece of profit out of Sigil by having her ambushed and scrapped in order to sell her cybernetics to the highest bidder. In exchange for her life, Redtooth revealed that the Raiders had no idea about Sigil's past, only that she had been found discarded in the nearby wastelands by a scavenging party. They thought she might have been an abandoned Technic League project, since no one had heard of an android quite like her before, but that was only a guess at best.Enraged by their deception, Sigil stormed her way out of Scrapwall before the Raiders could gather their forces to confront her. Leaving her few friends, and several new enemies behind, she vowed never to return. Redtooth's Raiders, meanwhile, soon found themselves dealing with a slew of new problems in the following days and thoughts of pursuing Sigil were soon discarded.Arc 2 - Working for a Blue Dragon and awakening my draconic heritageAfter she left Scrapwall in the dead of night, Sigil found herself wandering the wastelands of Numeria. Bereft of purpose, she fought whatever beasts she came across, seeking familiarity in contest of strength similar to what she had done in the arena. Rumors of a wandering android fighting wild beasts barehanded soon began circulating among the various outposts in the wastes. One day,  Sigil found herself confronted by an ancient blue dragon who introduced himself as Elagos. Elagos had decided to establish a lair in the deserts of Numeria, finding both the climate and preponderance of rare technology agreeable to him. He claimed to have become interested in Sigil after he detected a whiff of blue dragon ancestry in her creation. Elagos offered Sigil the opportunity to serve him as an emissary in the region, in exchange for which he promised he would help her awaken her heritage. Without a greater purpose, and eager to find out anything about her past, Sigil accepted, contingent on Elagos not requiring her to do anything that would impinge on her morals. A fastidious negotiator, Elagos had Sigil sign a contract outlining each of their responsibilities to each other and providing Sigil with reassurance that while he sought a valuable employee, he did not seek to exploit her in the same fashion her benefactors did.For the next few years, Sigil wondered the various outposts and wastelands of Numeria, collecting what scraps of technology she could for Elagos and protecting his interests in the area as he continued to develop his schemes. She became well-known among the local Kellid tribes as 'that dragon's minion' which granted her a certain degree of protection against more hostile interests that she was yet unaware of. In exchange for her work, Elagos spend some of his time tutoring her in the history and power of the chromatic dragons, awakening within her a greater portion of her bloodline. Soon, she found herself more in control of her draconic heritage and capable of greater feats of strength and magic than she had thought possible.However, all good things must draw to an end. After a period of time, Elagos had determined that his relationship with Sigil had reached the end of it's worth. There were no further easily accessible artifacts that he could locate for her to acquire and his lair and relationships with the Kellid outposts nearby had been sufficiently developed that her work as an emissary was no longer needed. Not seeing the point in destroying a valuable resource he might be able to use again in the future, Elagos informed Sigil that he would not be needing her services for the foreseeable future. He offered her a few trinkets from the horde he had amassed in Numeria and wished her well on her next steps so long as they didn't cross purposes in the future.Arc 3 - Fending off the Technic League and returning to NumeriaAfter leaving Elago's service, Sigil finally felt like she had a grasp on who she was and what she could do. She decided to indulge in her wanderlust and see more of what Golarion had to offer outside of the wastelands of Numeria. With nothing keeping her in Numeria, she decided to begin exploring some of the nearby River kingdoms, seeking to make her fortune and find new challenges. Unfortunately for her, while an android wandering in Numeria might not elicit more than casual gossip, her novelty in the river lands attracted a great deal more attention. Within weeks of her arrival in River Kingdoms, plenty of the local settlements had heard crazy stories about the human-like construct tearing through the local monsters with claws and lightning. One night, Sigil found herself confronted by a wizard and his entourage. The wizard arrogantly identified himself as a member of the Technic League and ordered Sigil to accompany him back to Numeria so that she could be studied forthwith. When she balked at his demands, he set his entourage upon her. It did not go well for him.With his entourage beaten and bloodied around him and his spellbook torn in half by Sigil, the wizard found himself feeling a lot more diplomatic and quickly explained to Sigil that rumors of her appearance and actions in the river kingdoms had made it's way back in Numeria. The Technic League was loath to have any technology, living or otherwise, escape Numeria and had begun assembling reclamation parties to bring her back and examine her, dead or alive, to see how exactly she was accomplishing these rumored feats that would be impossible for most androids. He warned her that while she had bested him without much difficulty, he was only an advance party who had gotten ambitious and thought he could handle her with the group he had with him. The wizard warned her that she would be hunted to the ends of Golarian by the Technic League and that the League would not forget the slights against them that she had committed this day.In his haste to remain useful and, accordingly, alive,  the wizard let slip that there were others that the Technic League had begun monitoring. A group of adventurers had been involved in a recent incident in Torch where the eponymous torch had gone out for a time before being relit. Since then, they had been seen wandering Numeria and had been tied to several other incidents of interest to the League, including rumors of a former, presumed deceased, member Furkas Xoud resurfacing.After pumping her new acquaintance for as much information as he would give her regarding the Technic League and their intentions towards her, she decided to return to Numeria where she would be better able to blend in as one android among many while she pondered her next steps.  It seemed to her that there was safety in numbers, and if these adventurers mentioned by her recent acquaintance were of interest to the League, she might find some allies to help her against the League. With that in mind, she began making her way to Torch, to see if she could track down her prospective new allies and see if they were worth her time."9/18/2017 18:55:44,Lumi Worldwandered,Anthropomorphic Cockroach,Gunslinger,"The 36th Most Radiant Daughter of Her Royal Highness Queen Radiance, Illuminator of Darkness, Bringer of Light, Our Lady of Magnificent Radiance, Blessed of the Chalice of St. Roentgen, etc etc, Lumi's full name is one of six possible arrangements of her mother's three primary titles, and as the sixth one with that particular arrangement she appends the numerical designation ""hex"" onto her primary title to get her name.Luci and Ray are the other names, with the numeric suffixes -ein, -dos, -tre, -qua, -quint, -hex, -sept, -oct, -nova, and -deci. The 11th would be named Lumieinein and beyond that increasing the second suffix by 1.Fortunately for the rest of the world, they are in no danger of being overwhelmed by Roachfolk, as while known for twins and triplets being the norm for births, only the Roachfolk Queen has the capacity to churn out offspring in the dozens.The Queen herself is a mutation brought about by drinking the glowing liquid that slowly gathers in the sacred Chalice of St. Roentgen over the course of a decade, resulting in what would be dubbed an arthropod-centaur, as the exactly appearance of the Queen varies. Shining Warqueen Aurora, for example, had the lower body of a scorpion which served her very well in battle.As the 36th eligible daughter for the throne, Lumi's never been at all likely to ascend to the position of queen, and aside from a rudimentary course in courtly manners, she was mostly left to secure her own pursuits, which are monsters, magitek, magic, and mayhem.Well, at least that's what other people call the mix of magic, technology, and alchemy that roachfolk use that is rather likely to violently explode. Lumi's preferred brand is somewhat less about explosions and more about delivering electric shocks and setting things on fire.Lumi hails from the city-state of Raven Mesa, the vast majority of which is underground, the royal palace of which serves to act as a guardpost into an ancient outpost filled with magitek. The city as a whole is somewhat a rival to Whitecliff Island as a place of study for everything, magical, mundane, magitechnological, alchemical, and scientific.A biothanolocomologist (we study living things and dead things that are still moving!) Lumi has gotten a grant from her university to travel the world and conduct research involving the various sorts of monstrous critters that hang about in various areas. Primarily to see if there are any bits that can be used in alchemy and how good they might taste when prepared properly.It is believed that the Chalice of St. Roentgen is a prototype of a magitek artifact that created the various breeds of Folk, as all the Radiant Royal caste Roachfolk, born from the bloodline of Raven Mesa's past queens, all of whom drunk from the Chalice, have displayed the capacity to induced limited, temporary physical and mental changes in others.Though exactly how it works has not been figured out, it has something to do with magical wavelengths of energy emitted from the Royal's luminescent patches while they perform what is known as St. Roentgen's Glow."9/18/2017 14:26:50,Illithrian Mallaiorn,Aquatic Half-Elf,Storm Sorcerer,"Pirates usually left Illithrian's small fishing village alone. Rarely was there a reason to pay them any attention and not worth the risk of angering the village's aquatic allies. The day Captain Harlot heard rumors of a small boy who could change the winds during a tantrum that he decided the reward was worth it. They found the boy easily enough playing on the docks. He was the only Half-Elf with blue hair and skin to be seen. With only minimal bloodshed, the pirates returned to the ship, the boys screams nearly causing the rowboat to capsize numerous times by conjures waves on a calm sea. Captain Harlot took him in and raised the boy as her own, treating him with all the love he could want, assuring him that she world protect him form all the mean pirates and convincing him that life with her was better than life in the fishing village. It was all a lie though. Captain Harlot had instructed the crew to torment the boy so she could play hero. She cultivated a loyal and strong and deadly sorcerer. Illithrian learned the truth when he was 16, when he overheard one of the old crew explaining to a new recruit the whole story. Illithrian set the ship on fire, rowboats and all. He dove overboard and swam 3 miles to shore. He wandered, exhausted, into the nearest pub and ordered ""A whiskey on the roughest day of his life"" and kept drinking until someone bumped into him. He turned around, punching a massive Goliath right in the ribs. A bit offput by this tiny boy taking a swing at him, Momak hesitated until the boy decided to swing with a follow through. Illithrian was soundly beaten but before he went down he released a burst of thunderous force, knocking everyone around him back. Seeing potential in the kid, the captain of Momak's ship called the fight off and invited Illithrian aboard as a member of his crew. No strings attached, Illithrian freely offered his services to the crew, though to this day 2 years later he still thinks Momak is going to murder him in his sleep."9/18/2017 20:11:27,B4D,Beeforged,Bard,"B4D is a beeforged bard who was originally a warforged, a golem built for war.

I looked up to her like a role model, because that's what kids do. I didn't know any better. We were a dynamic duo from the moment I could do the sneaky sneaks. Then came the moment that I came of age, the moment we could pull off the scam of the century, the day that my mom had been training me for. I was never given the details, but we were going to be rich beyond our wildest dreams. It was so big that we needed a trusted friend, a simple human by the name of Phoenix Dunbar who had helped us a few other times, as an extra distraction.The morning came, I was excited, nothing could go wrong. We prepared all day and I could barely contain my excitement. As the sun started to set, we arrived at our destination. But something was wrong. There were too many people there. Mom looked concerned and after a moment, the truth was revealed. She turned to me and told me to run. Phoenix had compromised us. I sneakily ran, only looking back to see my mother outnumbered by half a dozen men.The rest was a blur. I had nowhere to go. I bought necessities with the money I had on me and stole anything else that I needed to survive. I now realize that what my mother and I did was wrong. I'd like the opportunity to right the wrongs in my life and to be a better person (to an extent). It's hard to trust others in fear of ""the incident"" happening again, but I can manage. If only there were an adventure that I can join to prove my worth."9/18/2017 16:04:41,Ayeru Urthadar,Birali turned back to Human,Rogue/Paladin,"Ayeru lived with her mother most of her life, as her father was off fighting in the army. They lived in a small village, Mirefield, within the kingdom of Vale. Around the time Ayeru was seven years old, Mirefield was plagued by famine. Ayeru's mother would always insist that Ayeru eat more than her. She claimed it was because Ayeru needed the nourishment to grow and she didn't. After a year, many had perished and others were on the verge of death. Ayeru and her mother were among them. Ayeru watched as her mother slowly starved to death, always giving Ayeru what little food they had. Without her mother around to care for her, Ayeru soon met the same fate. Yet, that is not the end of her tale. She soon sprung awake on a cold stone table, looking at a high roof. As she looked around, she spotted a white bearded man, dressed in a dark robe. He was delighted to see she was alive and well. She felt alive and better, now, but felt very different, at the same time. As she continued to scan the room she saw a figure crumpled on the floor. It appeared to be human, but with cat-like features. She felt like she knew the creature, but could quite tell why. The wizard told her that he was pleased things went better this time and that he could fix the problems from his first attempt. He apologized that, sadly, her mother did not survive the experiment. Then, it hit her like a brick wall. The thing lying on the ground, that twisted corpse, was her mother. The wizard did all he could on consul her and keep her calm. After assuring her that everything would be alright, he left and returned with food, water, and a mirror. He handed Ayeru the mirror before anything else, telling her to have a look. She looked in the mirror to see that she now had cat ears atop her head, whiskers on her face, fur covering her body, claws coming out her fingers, and a tail extending out of her back. She was different, but at least she was alive.Over the following year, the wizard took care of Ayeru. His name was Xavallan Reonro. Ayeru had lost a lot of her memory, but would regain the occasional fragment. Xavallan may have cared for her, but he was no father. He would subject her to the tests and write reports about the results. To him, she was no longer a person. She was his creation. His pet.Eventually, Ayeru grew tired of this, and fled the tower by cover of the night. She ran as far away as she could. She swore vengeance against Xavallan. She promised to end him before he could hurt others the way he hurt her and her mother.However, living on her own was not easy. She was shunned by many simply because of her looks. She lived on the streets, eating rodents and trash like an animal, for that's what she was to them, an animal. She soon began stealing and burgling to make money. Her cat-like abilities made this easy for her. One day, she was spotted crawling out of a rather secure house's basement. Her spotter approached her with an opportunity. She could join a spy ring and make good money stealing information. She would be given somewhere to live, somewhere to belong. She excitedly agreed and began her new life as a spy.She was a prodigy. She could easily hide in plain sight with the right disguise. She got information as fast as she could and got out as soon as she could. She outed corrupt artisans. Destroyed evil aristocrats. She was finally making a difference in the world. Until, she slipped up.Loftaren had necromancer problems for years, and when it was found out that a local wizard and shopkeep was conspiring with them, all magic and magic casters were banned from the city. Yet, the lord of the city, Evandir, was a sorcerer himself. Ayeru was tasked to fix this. Reveal his secret and get him thrown away. And she did exactly that. She got the information she needed to prove his guilt and got him thrown in prison. The only problem was, he was a fine leader, but those who replaced him, were not.The military stepped in and took over. They were cruel, harsh, and abusive. The people wanted them out, but could do nothing. So, Ayeru set out to fix her mistake. She went around, disguising herself to be near nobles and the like in hopes of finding a group of adventurers to aid her. Or better yet, a group with the same goal in mind."9/18/2017 16:01:30,Oorr',Birdfolk,Monk,"He was given to the monastery when he was a child to be trained as a guardian of one of the pieces of the rod of Eight Parts.

Actually Gee is not their first name but it's difficult to pronounce if you don't speak Infernal so they shorten it. If people ask if it's with a hard G or a soft G he always says ""I'm flexible... Do what feels right."" and winks.Their mother was a succubus, and their father was of course the Demon Lord Graz'zt. Geeto rejects the gifts of both parents rather strongly, identifying as asexual and strongly abhorring being sticky in any way, and not caring very much about murder, although not being opposed to it happening to people, really. They probably deserve it, as far as he's concerned. Stupid mortals. (He is not immortal, but he figures 1000 years is close enough and refers to many species as mortals though this is ironic).However, he does pretend to be much more evil and bloodthirsty than he is, having spent a lot of his time hanging out with a group of his half-sibling cambions who are genuinely evil and bloodthirsty, but managing to talk his way out of ever doing very much harm. Given their lineage, they are very well suited to seducing people (though, yuck, about committing to that) to get them to do what they want, and also just pretending to be much better at inflicting murder and pain than they technically are, or, more commonly, pretending that such an easy kill is beneath their notice, deferring to their comrades to carry out the execution. He'd accomplished this by learning a little bit of illusionary magic and smooth talking through a couple of not-as-blood-as-they-looked encounters, but eventually the other cambions realized he wasn't actually that into hurting people and being demon-y, but was rather just going along for something to do and not having anyone else to hang out with. The other cambions did not very much enjoy being tricked and beat him pretty badly, which was easy, because he is a very feeble squishy mage. Geeto was obviously not readily accepted by the less-demony cultures of humans, elves, etc, but they hadn't expected to become a target of their own kind as well simply because they didn't really  have bloodlust. But that is what happened. Geeto did not have all the patience to learn magic from books like wizards, and so to solidify their plan at getting vengeance on their cambion compatriots, they decided to make their new goal of killing the Demon Lord Graz'zt a double-slight by making a sorcerer's pact with Asmodeus. They are fully aware that Asmodeus is probably using them in a plot with a greater means to a greater end, but they don't doubt Asmodeus wouldn't mind having something to hold over Graz'zt, so they aren't particularly worried about their own safety and are sure Asmodeus will be a faithful sorcerer sponsor. At least, for now. Their alliance currently has more benefits than costs, and Geeto doesn't anticipate that changing much in the future.Geeto is not especially friendly towards many people, and sort of ambivalent towards those he's not sure can help him further his goals. However, if he does give anyone a bit of his time, he's likely to be more interested in them if they're nice to him, because he's secretly pretty lonely and has a lot of angst. He also looks extremely much like Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way's wet dream, which he absolutely will use to his advantage as long as he can escape before anything sticky happens. He doesn't have a thing about dirt, really, just...moderate to highly viscious things. Which contributes to his aversion for killing people (blood, is gross, ew). His ""fake persona"" he uses when he'd rather not tell people he made a pact with Asmodeus is Waukeen. Graz'zt has apparently been super mean to her so he's pretending he's gotten her to make a special case for making a pact with him so he can kill Graz'zt. This is mostly when he wears his white clothes."9/18/2017 12:18:00,Chase Tales,Catfolk,Ranger,"Raised on tales of adventure and bravery, Chase set out to find his own story"9/17/2017 22:01:09,Nessarr Whispering Wind,Catfolk,Scout,"A light breeze stirred the grasslands as the group traveled through them.  Every day they camped and every day they got up and moved again, but that was how it always was and that was how it always would be.  Each morning, most of the hunters would leave them and return only shortly before nightfall with their prizes.  The ones left behind would guard the tribe and act as scouts, eager for their turn to go out again the next day.  While walking, the women spent most of the time gathering certain types of berries, bark, and flowers they knew to be edible in preparation for the nightly cooking.  When the hunters returned, they would skin and dress the meat with what they had and roast it or boil it while the rest of the group set up the encampment.  Usually circular in nature with a central communal area, the encampments were designed for quick escape should it become necessary.  Generally the lot was a fun bunch, playing and joking with one another.  However, they were also generally quite emotional and sometimes those emotions boiled and escalated quickly.  Fights between hunters could happen in the blink of an eye and after a quick scuffle they would be back to joking again.  This was the life of the Whispering Wind tribe of catfolk.Nera Whispering Wind was one of the smallest women in the tribe.  So small, in fact, that when the tribe camped close to a small settlement of humanoids she was commonly mistaken for a child.  She embraced it, however, as in addition to being small she was quite quick and agile.  When the Kaor Orcs attacked the Whispering Wind tribe, Nera was only a girl but she had already grown dextrous and was able to escape and hide until they left.  Half of the tribe had been killed or taken prisoner that night and only one had since returned.  Therrass Whispering Wind was the greatest hunter the tribe had ever known.  He alone was able to escape the Orcs, by slipping out of the chains they thought were secure.  It was said that in the original attack he killed a dozen orcs before he was taken.  It took him two weeks to track down and rejoin his tribe and when he did the first one to welcome him back was Nera, out scouting after the cooking was finished.  Two years later, their first son Nessarr was born.Nessarr Whispering Wind, named after a favorite uncle of Nera's who was no longer living, seemed to have the best qualities of both parents when growing up.  He was smaller than the other children, but not by much, and he had just as much speed and agility as his mother.  He longed to join the hunters in their daily rotation and his mother was only able to hold him back so long before she could not help any longer but allow him to apprentice himself.  It was common for boys to follow in the footsteps of their uncle, rather than their father, but neither parent had living siblings.  Nessarr instead chose Densharr, a great hunter and a friend of his father's, to guide his path.  Densharr was also quite spiritual and in addition to following Fharlanghn like the rest of the wandering tribe, he had a spiritual guide that he could regularly be heard speaking to.  Some thought this a sign of approaching senility but most paid it no heed.  Densharr taught Nessarr, along with his other apprentice Mersharr, to open themselves up to contact from their spiritual guide so that one day they might gain the confidence of one of their own.They often went on hunting trips, sometimes spending days away from the tribe so they could learn how to use tracks to find their way back.  The three of them hunted together, wandered together, and lived together.  They practiced stealth and subterfuge, once even stalking a human caravan as it traveled between settlements.  Nessarr loved it, and embraced the training.  Before long he surpassed his fellow apprentice and approached his master in skill.  Mersharr, instead of resenting Nessarr for this, embraced him as a brother and often joked with him about his father, teasing that he would never approach the skill of the greatest hunter to have ever lived.Despite learning quickly, however, Nessarr had quite a short attention span.  Often was the case where Densharr would be lecturing on which flowers would be deadly if swallowed or during which season it was best to hunt predatory animals, only to find Nessarr looking in other directions or seemingly lost in thought.  Nessarr was also naturally curious, being a catfolk, but he sometimes seemed to take it to a new level.  Once, while stalking a group of adventurers, he walked right up to them and introduced himself.  He had never seen adventurers before and wanted to speak with them.  They spoke with him for a few minutes, asking if he was in any trouble and what kind of reward they could get if they helped him, but they quickly realized that he was just a wanderer.A few months after that encounter, the three were taking a four day trip to scout the mountains north of where the tribe was.  It was the first time Nessarr had ever been anywhere other than open grassland or forest and the rocky terrain was new to him.  Something fateful happened that day that Nessarr would never forget.  While Densharr was demonstrating how to scale small cliffs safely, a streak of light followed quickly by another struck him.  Wounded but still able to hold on, he began climbing down as quickly as he could but a few seconds later the two streaks of light struck him again.  Nessarr heard a scream from behind him and whirled to find Mersharr trapped in a giant spider web stretched between two boulders.  A small group of humans was approaching quickly, two men with robes and three charging ahead with various weapons and armor.  The men had serious looks on their faces, looks of determination which frightened Nessarr.  The tribe had never been attacked while he was there but he had heard stories of raids happening before he was born.  Suddenly one of the men wearing a robe raised his hand and two more streaks of light left his fingertips and streaked past Nessarr.  Forgetting the belt knife at his waist, Nessarr turned to run, to try to get away from these men who were attacking them.  One of the humans with armor on jumped on top of him and pinned him to the ground as the two others rushed past.  He managed to turn his head just enough to see them draw their weapons and repeatedly stab something on the ground.  Densharr.They traveled a long distance, locked up in a long wagon with a few others.  There was a lizardman, covered in lesions and sores, which everyone seemed to avoid to the point of cramming up against the other side of the small space.  A kobold and a gnoll who liked to trade insults but never resorted to blows introduced themselves as Reevgog and Grrr'ark.  Reevgog explained how he was taken while trying to trade in a small outpost and Grrr'ark was overcome while scavenging for food in a forest.  At first, Grrr'ark seemed to want to challenge Nessarr and his friend Mersharr, but it was almost as if the will to fight was drained out of him.  The journey was long, and they seemed to maintain a steady pace without stopping for either supplies or to try to capture more slaves.After a hard three weeks of traveling they came to a town surrounded by a high wall.  The loud roar of many voices could be heard from inside the walls and the first thing they saw when the wagon passed under the gates was a huge crowd of people around a raised platform where a man was yelling and gesturing at several slaves in chains.  As they watched, one of the slaves was separated from the others and taken down off the platform.  When the wagon stopped, all Nessarr could think of was how to escape.  Anything was better than being sold, and as soon as one of the men in armor opened the door to the wagon he immediately launched himself out of the cage.  The man was ready for this however, and easily caught Nessarr under one arm while another man in armor took his place.  Nessarr was carried, kicking and scratching, to the platform where they chained him up with the others.When they arrived the sun was still a few hours from its peak and throughout the day many slaves were sold.  Grrr'ark went first, to a man who looked like a soldier but had markings of rank on his armor.  An hour later Reevgog was bought by a tall man with a tiny cat on his shoulder, wearing loose clothing and spectacles.  When dusk was finally began to approach, Mersharr was finally sold to a fat man with lots of jewelry.  He screamed when he was sold and gave Nessarr a terrified look, that was the last they ever saw of each other for Nessarr was immediately bought by a well dressed noble with a manservant.  As soon as Nessarr left the platform, the biggest human he had ever seen walked up and used a mighty axe to remove the heads of the last few slaves.  The lizardman seemed to be resigned to his fate and did not resist.Nessarr traveled with his noble owner for three days, during which time he learned the man's name was Elender Hastings and he owned a keep surrounded by open grassland on three sides and forest on the fourth.  He was quite fond of hunting and wanted Nessarr to both teach and guide him.  Nessarr asked about his friend Mersharr but Elender could only say that the man who bought him was known to be a slave handler and would likely sell him again for a profit.The keep was well lit when they arrived at dusk on the third day, tall light grey walls with torches every dozen feet or so and a pennant flying from the top of the tower in the middle.  It was really only one large tower, wide enough to completely engulf the camps of Nessarr's tribe and a good bit taller than any of the trees nearby.  There was a small battlement circling around the conical roof of the keep, and the outer wall was separated from the tower by about 20 feet and it was about an equal amount shorter.  They entered the keep and Nessarr was immediately taken to see a man in a robe, similar to those who captured him but with a palpable aura of power radiating from him, who fitted a collar onto his neck.  As soon as the collar was on him, Nessarr felt a faint pulsing, barely noticeable but for the silence in the room.  The man explained that the farther from the keep he went the worse the pulsing would get and the more he would wish to return.  He was then shown to his room, which was much larger than any tent he'd ever been in but still felt confined.  There was a door that had no lock and a window too small for a human to fit through.  Nessarr, however, was not human and managed to wriggle his way free in the night.  He dropped down a dozen feet or so to a stone roof and snuck out of the keep.  Sure enough, as soon as he left he could feel the pulsing begin to rise and after about a half mile began doubting his actions.  An equal distance later he could not help but turn back; not from the pulsing but because he wanted to.Nessarr spent years at the keep.  At first he thought a lot about his tribe and where they might be, about how he could track his way back to them and even find his friend Mersharr.  They were hopeless thoughts though, and eventually only came to him occasionally and without the pulling force they once had.  Nessarr actually liked it at the keep, Elender loved to hunt and even camp in the forest sometimes.  He encouraged Nessarr not only to teach him but to learn more on his own and even had Saied, the man who put the collar on Nessarr when he first arrived at the keep, extend the range so that Nessarr could roam more freely on his lands.  Nessarr took full advantage of this, especially when Elender went on trips and left him behind.  He ranged quite far before he was pulled back, he was even able to visit the nearest town and learn more about people.  He learned to love Elender, but hated Saied and other humans, for humans were responsible for the death of his master and the separation of him from his tribe.  He studied humans, studied their habits and when he saw the men of the keep sparring he learned where they tried to attack each other the most.Then another fateful night came.  Nessarr was dining with Elender, an uncommon occurrence but one that tended to happen after Elender returned home from a trip or after a successful hunt.  Suddenly the clang of alarms rang out and the sounds of men fighting in the courtyard reached Nessarr's ears.  Elender jumped up and together they ran to see what was happening.  The sight was one nobody should ever have to see.  Hordes of man-like creatures were attacking the keep, the flesh hanging from their bones as if rotting even as the creatures attacked ferociously.  Men screamed and died before their onslaught and sometimes even when the creatures seemed to fall they would stand back up moments later with renewed vigor.  Nessarr looked behind the creatures and saw a man in black robes gesturing wildly, and Elender noticed him at the same time.  Suddenly what looked like a pebble flew straight as an arrow from the top of the keep and the man erupted in flames.  When the flames died a few seconds later the man was still there, seemingly unaffected.  He gestured up toward the top of the keep and there was a blood curdling scream of pure terror followed by a limp body falling to the ground.  Nessarr saw rictus of pure dread on the face of Ewin, Saied's apprentice, even as it turned grey with death.  A bolt of lightning connecting the top of the tower to the man in the black robes appeared, searing a line into Nessarr's vision, and this time the man looked hurt.  He gestured and was suddenly no longer there.  The creatures then went into a frenzy, attacking with no form or abandon.  Two of the creatures jumped up to where Nessarr and Elender were, one quickly dispatching one of the two soldiers with them and the other going straight for Elender.  The noble was by now trained quite well in hunting however he was no match for this creature whose flesh seemed to drip from its exposed bones, its eye sockets empty pits.  While Nessarr tried to stab it with his belt knife, the other soldier was busy fighting the other one.  The belt knife did little good and Nessarr watched in horror, even while continuing to stab and stab, as Elender's face was eaten before his eyes.  Elender's screams burned a permanent scar of hatred into Nessarr's heart for these creatures and the man with the black robe.  The soldier was able to destroy the other creature and helped Nessarr dispatch the one that killed Elender, then started yelling that the lord was dead.  The creatures seemed not to be getting back up any longer and after a few minutes a very few men were left standing but they were all men.Saied took control of the keep after that, and though Nessarr hated the man he begged Saied to teach him how to fight the creatures for it was Saied who defeated the man in the black robe.  Saied found a distant cousin of Elender's and gave control of the keep to him and together with Nessarr began to travel and learn more about those called ""Undead"".  They had many adventures together, and learned much of the world.  Though Nessarr had absolutely no gift for magic, Saied shared his knowledge of Undead and many other creatures such as Elementals, Plant creatures, and Constructs created by men very much like Saied himself.  Nessarr honed his skills as a hunter and became more in tune with the wild, and while Saied continued his magical research Nessarr became so in tune with nature that something quite spectacular happened.  He started seeing small flickers at the edge of his vision causing him to look and see things he would have never noticed before.  Certain sounds became slightly stronger and drew his attention a little bit more.  Whenever there was danger, he seemed to be warned of it a moment before anyone else noticed.  He also became more aware of tracks and seemed to draw upon hidden knowledge of nature.  Whenever he noticed these things, the faint image of a panther entered his mind for a brief moment.Eventually more images and even sounds came with the panther.  Nessarr would see in his mind an image of an orc a brief moment before he and Saied were attacked by a group of orcs.  Immediately before a rabbit jumped out from behind a tree, Nessarr would see a flicker at the edge of his vision and a brief sound to guide his attention to that spot.  This was all very strange for Nessarr but he made sure to open himself up to more, and to keep himself in tune with nature.  Eventually he began hearing a voice, it wasn't any kind of voice he had heard before.  It was almost like a throaty growl, but not unfriendly sounding.  It spoke to him, guided him when he was in the wild, and seemed to inexplicably leave him when he was in a town or city.  Nessarr realized that this was the spiritual guide that Densharr had tried to tell him about, much like the one Densharr had been speaking to.  Over time Nessarr began to realize that he could speak with other natural spirits as well, even sometimes those of ordinary plants.  He became so in tune with nature that he could ask nature itself questions and if he concentrated for awhile sometimes he even received answers.They continued like this, Nessarr with his spiritual guide and Saied with his studies, and had many adventures together.  Nessarr began to overcome his dislike of Saied and eventually grew fond of the friendship.  It was because of that fondness that Nessarr reacted so strongly one morning when the force of nature itself told him that a strong unnatural presence was within Saied's tent.  He immediately burst into the tent only to find Saied completely engulfed by a sickly looking ooze.  Not knowing what to do, he drew his belt knife that he had kept since Elender's keep and tried to stab at the ooze ontly to have the knife wrenched from his grasp and sucked in to join Saied.Nessarr grabbed the equipment that Saied had made or bought for him, including a magical quiver, able to produce an unlimited number of magical arrows, and the magical bow that was also in the collection.  He also grabbed his pack and fled, never to see Saied again.  He wandered and wandered, losing himself in his grief, always wondering if there was anything he could have done to save Saied.  He gathered tales of oozes attacking people, hard to find because it didn't happen often, and eventually found out how to fight them.  He would not be caught unawares again by the like.Nessarr, together with his spiritual guide and magical equipment, continued to wander.  This time, however, he would try to be prepared no matter what happened.  He retained his cheerful demeanor that he had always had, and he made friends easily, but he was always ready to strike when necessary."9/18/2017 7:38:08,Catgirl Airu,Catgirl,Rogue,"Transformed into a catgirl by magical means.

Thinking too much can get you killed in this business.” Martin was slouched down in his worn leather chair. The chair looked tiny with  Martin sprawled over it, like a bear who couldn't figure out how human furniture was supposed to work. He was a giant of a man, a fact that always made Tristan wonder how he got into this line of work. If Tristan hadn’t seen him in action so many times, he wouldn’t believe that Martin could move like a panther through the night.	“That’s what everyone says when there’s some real money to be had or when you’re about to be stabbed in the back. Either way, I like my odds with thinking.” 	Tristan was trying to emanate a casual air. He was one of the best thieves in the business and did work for best guild there is: the Black Tails. Martin was his fence, friend, and mentor. He was also Tristan’s superior, though Tristan tried not to let that get in the way. Martin had seen Tristan’s quick fingers when he was still an angry six year old and had taken him into the Tails. Tristan had been a quick learner and was soon running jobs with thieves ten years his senior. He had a drive to be the best which had a knack to make him as many enemies as friends. Tristan tried to play this off as another job to further his career with the Black Tails. He couldn’t show the hunger behind his eyes.	Martin eyed Tristan warily. The boy was good, there was no doubt about it. Martin had been able to see that when the cocky little six year old tried to pickpocket him those fourteen years ago. Tristan was now one of the Black Tails’ greatest assets and he knew it too. What Tristan didn’t know was what he was getting himself into. Martin cursed himself, not for the first time that day. Tristan wasn’t a boy anymore. Not that he was ever child-like, being the rape-child of a Dark Elf pirate and a human whore from the docks doesn’t make for a care-free life. Tristan had always been grown up but now he was more refined. Tristan moved with a smooth efficiency that was almost graceful. He slouched casually in his guild issued leather armor, worn from use. Tristan always looked bathed in shadow, perhaps due to his dark skin, but now it positively flowed out from him. The boy had donned an indifferent air, but Martin could tell that he wanted this. The shadow practically pulsed with hunger. Martin cursed himself again.	Tristan had gotten the big assignment, as usual. This was by no means Tristan’s first big heist but his chest fluttered in anticipation. Something felt different about this one. Maybe it was that Tristan had insisted on doing it alone, or perhaps he had some premonition of what awaited him. Either way, Tristan was nervous. He stopped picking his way through the Underway for a moment to examine his hands under the torchlight. They never shook, even when he was nervous. Reassured, Tristan continued to the objective. 	At last he reached the locked steel trapdoor. Tristan knelt to examine his entry point, and was somewhat disappointed. This wasn’t even a challenge. He pulled out his lockpick and had the door open after a few soft clicks. He could hear water rushing below, just like Martin said. He sniffed the air timidly. It wasn’t sewage. Not believing his good luck, Tristan chuckled as he dropped through the opening and into the icy water. 	The torrent swept Tristan along a smooth stone chute for what seemed like an eternity. Maybe Martin’s information was bad and Tristan would die here, drowned in some long forgotten stream miles below the surface. Just as his vision was going black around the edges, Tristan became vaguely aware of the fact that the chute was gone and he was now falling. He took a ragged breath of air and arranged his numb limbs into a dagger shape before he plummeted into a deep black pool. Clawing away at the dark water, Tristan fought his way to the surface. 	He was in some kind of cistern within an ancient city. Tristan knew that the surface of Mystras was just a fraction of her true size. He had been through the Underway enough to see the bones of old buildings that have been built on top of over and over again, but this was different. This felt like the first Mystras. As he used his superior night vision (his monstrous father had given him some things) to explore the chamber, he knew he was right. This was bedrock, hewn by skilled craftsmen but damaged by the ravages of time and the elements. A sagging archway framed a pathway off to the right and Tristan swam for the land.	This place was the most amazing thing Tristan had ever seen. He had stolen priceless things from human nobles and dwarf craftsmen but this place seemed forged by magic. There were no chisel marks on the stone walls, no bricks in the roads, even the crumbling murals seemed to be natural. It was like someone had called the buildings out of the rock. Some of the aqueducts were even working, though they seemed a little worse for the wear. Tristan was so enamored that he momentarily forgot why he was in this ancient place in the first place. Then he saw torchlight. It looked like sunlight at first, so dark were the paths Tristan had been winding through. Tristan slowed his pace and muffled his steps to nothing. He picked a wall that was cast in shadow and slid along its edge until he could get a view of the scene. 	Tristan poked his head around the corner and saw what had to be a hundred people in an open area of the old city, most of who were holding torches in one hand with a knife held aloft in the other. That wasn’t even the weirdest part. Every one of these freaks were arrayed in animal skins and horns with headdresses made from the skulls of various animals or constructed in imitation of horrible creatures. Martin wanted him to steal from this crazy ass cult?! Then Tristan saw it. The amulet he had heard about from eavesdropping on a few Dragon Tail higher ups was dangling from the neck of what he could only assume was the priest of whatever ritual was going on. The hunger nearly doubled Tristan over, the void reaching out to the amulet. He had to have it. It belonged to him.	Tristan began desperately looking around for some means to get his amulet. The only path to it was through a hundred crazy cultists, so he did the only logical thing. Tristan jumped out of cover and waved his arms frantically, calling out to the cultists, before running off into the darkness of the ancient city. There was instantly a furious uproar from the mob and they tore after Tristan, but he was one step a head. Tristan was perched atop a particularly fragile aqueduct that had endured a rockslide too many. He could feel the structure sway slightly as he shifted his weight to avoid the water still flowing along its trough. The mob couldn’t see him; the torches played havoc with their night vision which was no doubt poor to begin with. Tristan let out a low whistle while he dropped to the edge of the aqueduct with a jerk, sending it careening toward the incoming mob.	A few of the cultists were crushed in the initial crash of stone, but most were knocked over by the water that was now flowing over everyone. Thankfully, most of the torches had been extinguished. Tristan had narrowly avoided being crushed himself, and was now gingerly stepping his way through the groaning bodies. All was enveloped in darkness, perfect conditions for Tristan to make his way back to the open area to search for his amulet. The priest was still standing in the spot where Tristan had left him, peering into the darkness in search of his acolytes. Tristan snuck behind him with ease and cut the amulet from his neck. The priest spun around brandishing his knife, but Tristan had already retreated into the shadows. The amulet made Tristan’s muscles thrum with energy and he quickly fastened it around his neck. The priest howled into the darkness as Tristan scampered away through a small crevice. He was in the form of a small lizard. No one would ever find him, not the cultists or the Black Tails. He wasn’t giving this amulet to anyone. It was his."9/18/2017 7:47:04,Bly,Deep Gnome,Cleric/Druid,"Kidnapped from underground as a child, she escaped captivity with the help of a magical bear.

He is the last child of the last child of the last child, last in line for the position of ""Arch"" within a noble Svirfneblin family, but yet is still the great-grandson and direct line of current Patriarch, Orthan Fu-Finfergel. The family's secret name is “Fu,” a name which nobody knows outside of the family or the family’s superiors (if there are any). Also, due to the secrecy of the Deep Gnome hierarchy, only a few people in the family have an inkling of what the family’s position, role, and duties are, and only one, the current Patriarch, knows for sure.Due to his low stature within the family and near crippling shyness that was only overcome in bursts of anger and awkwardness, he was useless for diplomatic or honorific duties. Because of this, he left his family to take the only honorable path that seemed possible for him - joining the Deep Gnome monastery in a region of the Underdark that is close to lava flows and volcanoes. Members of the monastery tend to be elementally attuned to earth or fire. The natural silence and the disciplines of training and harnessing the energy of the self and of the elemental forces within the volcanoes allowed him to downplay his weaknesses and hone his abilities. Upon joining the monastery, he began to learn the fire arts and martial traditions of the Svirfneblin, earning the Deep Gnome Monastic name of ""Kaeryim,"" or ""Kindlepalm"" in Common speech.  Not long after being initiated into the ways of the Elemental Fire Monk, a tragedy struck him. When wandering on his own through some of the deepest and hottest magma chambers of the area, he was surprised, overpowered, knocked (or magicked) unconscious, and abducted. He woke to find himself trapped in a locked box, stripped of all possessions, and with no memory of who or what had surprised him. He was transported in that state for so long as to become completely unaware of how far from home he was. After what seemed forever, he was somehow made unconscious again, and awoke in the mouth of a cave with no entrance to the Underdark, looking at the sun for the first time ever. Lost, disoriented, and traumatized, all he wants to do is find his way back to his monastery and live in peace.  He has been traveling above under the name “Kindle,"" looking for a way back to the Underdark, staying out of the way of most settlements most times, and making every attempt to pass unnoticed. He only ventures into a city, where he would clearly and uncomfortably stand out if surface dwellers were to see him clearly, if survival necessitates.At times, though, his desire for anonymity is overwhelmed by his lawful nature, and his sense of justice compels him to intervene on behalf of others, especially if someone seems to be lost or victimized, like himself. And he has become quite courageous, if not somewhat paranoid, in the face of threats - never wanting to again be as helpless as he was. Mostly, though, he is looking for telltale holes in the ground."9/18/2017 8:15:13,Pa’Nika Di’Koteke,Demon,Assasin,"Nika was once one of the most powerful Devils in the Infernal Realm.

When it hatched, the young one was mottled white and silver, the colors of both her parents and the dragon who saved her life. She was raised by all three and displayed a gift for cold magic early on in adolescence.

I saw this as odd, but kept my mouth shut, until I joined my father and mentor as a clan cleric. At that time, my father spoke out against the leader, who, finding this offensive, had him executed. Despite the teachings of the faith that my clan once held dear, the clan responded with a chorus of cheering. I ran from them, realizing my clan had slowly fallen from their faith and could not support their actions.Having nothing but personal belongings and faith, I made my way across the country.

His father was gone before he was born, being full dragon (he took human form when it came to the romance); he obviously had better things to do, though no resentment was held towards his father, and he even took on his dad’s dragon name of Turnroth at the behest of his father. Growing significantly faster than the other kids in the village, consisting of mostly humans and the occasional mountain dwarf, (even by dragonborn standards) he’s was often volunteered for physical labor, and eventually drafted by a small military faction at age 13, and at the start he was perfectly fine serving for a time, as he always wanted to be part of something bigger, and was very quickly outgrowing his tiny village, but then he learned a hard fact of life.	It turns out the commanding officer of his unit, who was not present when he was recruited, was nothing but a corrupt, cruel bigot. If you weren’t human, you may as well be dirt in his eyes. Spyrok stuck with it for the better part of the year, doing whatever good he could despite the less than favorable situation. That is until the day came when his CO went too far, by burning down a village just because a stray dog mistook him for a latrine. Spyrok gave into his draconic instincts for the first time in his life, proceeding to knock him out cold with a single, powerful punch to the head, and immediately resigning from active duty.	Knowing he couldn’t return home at risk of endangering his friends or family, he sent a message to them warning them to evacuate as soon as they could.

Until I ran away from home at 14 to join the Navy. As a starry-eyed, sharp-toothed youngster, I turned up to the office, where they turned me down. So I turned to the next best thing, a mercenary crew defending merchant ships from pirates. They were wary of me at first, but on a ship, everyone pulls their weight, and we got along fine. Not much happened, since the pirates went after the merchants who didn't hire armed escorts. The lingering smell of alcohol on my breath earned me the name ""Boozebreath"". So they tried to get me drunk. After a barrel or two to overcome my resistance to poison, I was properly drunk. And then I took a dare to walk off the plank. Again, I was 15. To add to my misfortunes, I scraped myself against a railing. The blood spread through the waters, drawing the attention of a nearby shark. Drunk and foolhardy, I stared it down as it approached, and punched it across the face. As the shark began to bleed, I began to get angrier. And that was the first time I flew into a rage, tearing the shark's teeth and fins out. I returned to the ship, corpse over my shoulder, and got even more drunk. I spent another few years on the ship, keeping my shark souvenirs close at hand. 8 years after, the pirates finally grew bold enough to attack the ship I was on, in the middle of the night. They fought their way onto the ship, taking it over and slaughtering our crew. They kept me alive, bound and restrained, uncertain how to kill me as I frothed and shrugged off blows from their blades. When they left me alone, I melted the restraints with my spit, both the ropes and the guards. And then, with my axe, a piece of flint, and a pile of gunpowder, I brought the ship down with us."9/18/2017 13:10:32,Jerreth Moonscale,Dragonborn,Paladin,"Jerreth is the Third child of a politically influential and wealthy family.  As such he had little to no chance of ever claiming inheritance or gaining political sway.   Instead, his family deemed it best to send him as an Offering to the Church of Bahamut, a political pawn in his Clan’s machinations.  When he was four he was pierced with the signs of his Clan, the Mother of Pearls which cast across his brow.  When he was five, his Clan abandoned him to the teachings of Bahamut.  It was there that Jerreth was disciplined and tutored in the religious teachings of Bahamut under the guidance of his Mentor, Yorskan Hammerwing.  The other children quickly learned of his situation, and mockingly titled him “Gift.”  It was from a young age he took that mockery and claimed it as his own, gaining an air of superiority and boasting that he was “A Gift from Bahamut himself.”  He grew up cloistered and kept away from any other race than Dragonborn, and thus thought of anything different from himself as inferior.While his family had intended for him to become a politically influential member of the Clergy, such as a prominent advisor, Jerreth was a poor student.  Through his own wishes and encouragement by his Mentor, he was instead ranked as a Blade of the Church, a soldier.  He knew his vacancy at the top would allow other members to fill his seat, and allowed them to squabble and plot amongst themselves.  He was happy with a sword in hand.  When he turned 10, he began his martial training.  His religious education and guidance in life continued under Yorskan. When Jerreth entered adulthood, he spent much of his time on military missions.

This did not completely eliminate his sense of superiority, however, much to Fenzys dismay.It finally came time for Jerreth to formally take his oath, becoming a member of the Holy Order of Bahamut as a Paladin and Adjudicator.

Most went into priesthood to attend clan shrine to Bahamut.Basic training in discipline, agility, fitness given in early years - at coming of age (16yrs), each member of martial sect given weapons crafted by clan leader, Bhazzaruan.Kuru - master archer, received silver inlaid warbow; Meten - impulsive and dangerous, got twin battleaxes. Andumar received glaive - always enjoyed polearms and their like.Martial sect initiates are given the choice: - remain with the clan to learn from the older warriors, and have a higher chance of mating, carrying on line- leave to learn from other races, see the world and bring back knowledge and/or riches for the clan.Kuru stayed - more dutiful son, most favoured by father. Haven't seen him for 16 years (1/2 current lifespan).Meten and Andumar set out together - were always closer with each other than with Kuru, possibly due to hatching within seconds of each other (Kuru a few hours older).Set out west to reach Sword Coast and see the sea spoken of by others who returned from learning.Split up after 4 years (12 years ago) when Meten took a post as a ship captain's bodyguard, operating out of Waterdeep.Andumar took up with a mercenary troop in the same area, commanded by half-elf Steri One-Ear. Learned a lot from One-Ear, in getting paid as much as in martial skill.Rose to rank of sergeant [or equivalent], in charge of a dozen - troop size variable depending on needs, usually around 60.Band travelled up and down coast, taking on contracts and recruits wherever possible, sometimes in morally grey areas.Andumar's cloak came from the contract where he got his last promotion, taking out a notorious orc raiding band. Orc standards are not easy to come by.Retired when agreed term of ten years was up; left with collection of weapons & armour (warhammer, shield, chainmail, cloak, manacles, rank insignia, cash, etc.).Headed to Waterdeep in hope that Meten was in port - heard stories of her ship, but had set sail months before his arrival.Set out east to return to clan.

Shortly before adolescence he was sold into indentured servitude to dwarves for the necessary medicine, likely saving lives. But the clan got wiped out by a warring clan soon after, and Lorob stayed on with the dwarves and grew up alongside his ""brother,"" Dain Loderr. They trained to be warriors, and when their skills exceeded the needs of the peaceful Loderr, Lorob and Dain took to the road and the life of adventuring.They soon fell in with a skilled band: Shava Xiloscient, an elven druid who knew the personal names of every animal in her forest, and Andry Tealeaf, a halfling rogue who couldn't speak but seemed to know everyone's secrets. Dain took the lead as a fighter with impeccable use of his waraxe, and Lorob kept them all safe with his shield and the scant paladin training he had received as a child. Together they had a handful of successful missions, and it seemed that they might make a name for themselves amongst the intelligent races.But the group was not so harmonious as outsiders may have believed. Shava and Dain bickered endlessly, the elf favoring over-caution and the dwarf favoring quick, decisive action. Secretly, Lorob often thought Shava made a lot of sense, and he often wondered at the raw natural power wielded by this elf maiden he found so appealing. But Dain was his brother, and rather than side with Shava, Lorob intentionally pitted them against one another, in part for amusement and in part so he could spend more time exploring his feelings. The fighting got worse, Shava grew to distrust Dain's increasingly reckless leadership, Andry grew more sullen and removed, and it seemed the entire party was liable to split after the next mission. When they entered the old tombs to clear a few undead, the only person anyone was willing to speak with was Lorob, and even Dain seemed to do so begrudgingly. Lorob realized the risk of losing his found family and agonized over what to do-- perhaps so much that he missed the clues that they were walking into a trap.There was a necromancer, it seemed, or perhaps a cult. Whatever it was, the tombs had far more than the few skeletons they had expected. By the time Lorob realized they were under attack, Andry was already surrounded by wights, frantic and silent as they drained her life. Dain charged forward and fell into a pit trap, and when Shava tried to retreat, something grabbed her leg and dragged her into a pool of water. Lorob tried to save each, tried to put himself between the monsters and his friends, but it was a losing battle. Each team member fought their own fight, and then they each died. Dain was the last: when the wights followed him into the pit, he ordered Lorob flee. Lorob followed the order.Lorob existed in a state of rage for the next month. He needed funds to gather up another adventuring party to clear the tombs and recover his friends' bodies, but he could not get the village to pay for what they saw as a botched mission. So he went deep into debt with usurers to pay for a second expedition, this one large and more than enough to defeat any wights. They succeeded in retrieving the bodies of Lorob's former team, the team accepted its pay, and then they moved on. Lorob laid his friends to rest, taking a few keepsakes from each: Andry's Tealeaf dagger, Dain's waraxe, and Shava's spear. He also kept Shava's necklace, a glass sphere with a small autumn leaf suspended within, which she told him symbolized the lost beauty of the ancient elven gods. Something about that resonated with him, and it comforted him during many nights.But Lorob could not mourn forever, nor could he go long without paying his debts. Under pressure from the usurers, Lorob took employment with a guild he'd never heard of, ""AchieveWorks SuccessPath,"" who offered him upfront payment in exchange for protective services and some sort of specialized training. Lorob had low expectations, but he was amazed to find that the AWSP team had all the answers he needed! He could be a success again, make a difference and help people, and all it took was AWSP's 9 Step Program towards Building a Better You. After he finished his mandatory training, Lorob enrolled in the 13 Paths to Teamwork course, then the 22 Building Blocks of Workplace Synergy. Soon he was a licensed merchant for AWSP, hosting seminars and moonlighting as a guard for AWSP's growing coffers. In his free time he tried to learn more about the elven gods from temples and books, and all his study and growth made Lorob feel like a new man.Finally, Lorob gained license to recruit and market the AWSP way on his own. He tried traditional marketing and seminars, but eventually found that he longed to care for and protect a new group of warriors, to save them from the inefficiencies and lack of teamwork that had plagued his group. And so he is in search of a band of adventurers, where he can return to doing good in the world and maybe spread the methods of AWSP to all who would listen."9/18/2017 7:28:18,Bobo,Dragonborn,Bard,"Bobo, the BongoBong Bard.A green dragonborn, born with his brothers Zozo, a blue dragonborn, and Jojo, a white dragonborn, has always been a very interesting character. Growing up in his dragonborn clan, he was raised to be a warrior like his forefathers, but he never really had his heart in it. He always prefered (attempting) to make music with anything he could find with his brothers. Seeing how they weren't interested in hand to hand combat , the elders decided at their 7th birthday that Bobo and his brothers might be better suited for magic. They all thoroughly enjoyed playing with magic, but never utilized it to its full capabilities. But one day, playing with some fire magic in a field, they discovered something truly fascinating. They burned a patch of plants near them, but they didn’t smell like normal burning. Upon further inspection, they realized they’ve never seen this plant before. But they didn’t think much of it, mostly because they kept on sniffing the burning air, and as they kept on inhaling, the less they cared and the more they sniffed and the less they cared and the more they sniffed… until they were all on the ground laughing without a care in the world. “What is this stuff?” said Zozo. “I don’t know but we gotta take some home!” said Jojo. “What should we call it though?” said Bobo. After a pause all three brothers came up with the same answer after just a minute “Weed!” They all cried.Little did they know this was just the beginning of their adventure with this magical plant known as “weed”.For 3 years they kept their “weed” a secret, during which, everyday after training they would sneak out in the night and smoke their weed, which they learned how to grow properly, along with learning that drying it first makes it easier to smoke, as does rolling it up in a thin paper. They also discovered that during their smoke, they played their music ten times better than ever before, with Zozo playing a stolen lyre, Jojo on a bamboo flute, and Bobo on a bearskin drum. One day, they decided that they were going to run away to a big city and become the best performers in the land, and they did just that at only 10 years old. All they brought were clothes, some rations, about 300 gold pieces, their instruments, and all the weed they could hold. Upon arriving at Mon, the largest city for 100 miles, they soon discovered that they would need a place to stay and perform. Now as 3 dragonborn boys in a primarily human city, they were truly an oddity, so upon arriving at the main tavern in town, they asked the barkeep if they could perform there for some food and a room. Now this barkeep had thought he’d seen everything, but certainly not this. He took a liking to them immediately and told them to set up in 5 minutes and perform. They got on the podium and were ready to perform. Everyone was gathering around to hear the music of three dragonborns. Just one more step to prepare for the brothers… as they all lit up their rolls everyone in the bar collectively gasped. “Get out of here with that reeking drug!” yelled the barkeeper “This is a respectable establishment!” Confused, the brothers ran out of the tavern clutching their instruments. As they ran out with their instruments in one hand and their weed in another, they were stopped by a peculiar looking man who reeked of the smell of weed. “Hey little guys, are you lost?” he asked. “No, not really, we just got kicked out of a tavern for smoking these though.” replied Bobo. “You don’t say? Let me see those.” Asked the man. As Bobo handed his over to the man, he instantly recognized it, “Oh! You boys smoke weed! No wonder you got kicked out!” He laughed, “Here, let me show you a place where you can smoke and play, names Gareneous by the way, but everyone calls me Gary.” So Gary led the brothers down a few blocks and a few turns until they came upon a door in the ground. Upon entering, the dragonborn knew that these were their people. Everyone in the place was smoking a roll similar to theirs, and it smelled like their smoke everywhere. Bobo, Zozo, and Jojo fit in perfectly, they were an oddity, being dragonborns, but also because their music was just so great and never got old. They learned all about “weed culture” and all the different types of weed and different ways of smoking it.  After 5 years of living with the weed group, Gary came up to Bobo one day and asked him, “Bobo, how much do you know about magic?” “Not much” replied Bobo “Me and my brothers used to know a bit before we ran away from our clan.” “Oh ok, so I assume you’ve never heard of magic music then?” Gary asked. “No I can’t say I have, I’ve been told my music is magic though.” answered Bobo. “Well that’s just it!” replied Gary, “Yours and your brothers music has the potential to become true magic! You could be the most powerful bards in the world! You especially, which is why I made you this.” Gary unveils his present, which he had invisible on the table, a large green glass bong, with bongos put into the middle of the shaft. “This” proclaimed Gary, “Is a magical bong I made specifically for you. It can not break, can not be lost, and allows you to combine your two passions, smoking and music! But with this, it will also completely unlock your full magical potential.” “This is great!” exclaimed Bobo, “So I just get to have it?” “Yeah! But I do need you to do something for me though.” said Gary “There’s a forest to the east of here, about a week’s travel, and I need you to go there and deal with a problem there. Only you can do it.” “Uh are you sure?” Asked Bobo, “I mean I just play drums and smoke I don’t know what I could really do…” “Trust me, you can do it, also you need to leave immediately, good luck!” replied Gary as he snapped his fingers, and teleported Bobo to the east entrance to the city with food, water, supplies, weed, and his bong. Seeing no other option, Bobo headed East to this forest.Upon reaching the forest in question Bobo saw immediately what the problem was, and it was terrifying. A giant brown gorilla was rampaging around the forest, knocking everything over and terrorizing all the animals on the forest. “What does Gary think I can do about this gorilla?” He thought to himself, “Maybe it might have something to do with this bong, not like I know any magic though.” So Bobo followed close behind him, but far enough away so the gorilla could not see him. Eventually, as the sun was setting, the gorilla decided to head to his home, which turned out to be a rather sophisticated abode, built above the tree line with a cave for support. After an hour or so of the gorilla entering the home, Bobo entered the cave to find what was hidden in there, and in there he found a huge pile of bananas! But Bobo took too long admiring the bananas, and as he turned around he saw the ape looming over him, and upon closer inspection found he wore a red necktie with the letters “DK” written on them. Bobo did the only thing he could in that moment, and took a huge hit from his bong, and played his bongos like no tomorrow. As it turned out the gorilla had bongo’s too and played along with him. They played all through the night and were able to communicate with the beats of the drums, during which Bobo learned that DK was angry because he couldn’t find any more bananas, which he needs to live. They both went to sleep however covered in used banana peels. In the morning then, Bobo went outside the cave to start the day off right, with weed. He leaned up against a tree and began to blow smoke into the leaves. But the most interesting thing happened just then, the tree started growing more bananas instantly all over the branches! Knowing the struggle of his friend DK, he decided to help him, so he went around to every banana tree in the area and blew nice large smoke clouds into the leaves so they would all sprout bananas. A few hours later DK woke up and noticed what had happened and became ecstatic, he almost accidentally crushed Bobo! DK then went out and picked all the banana’s that he could and brought them back to his cave. That night they feasted on bananas, weed, and music. This went on for nearly 7 years, during which DK, which was short for Donkey Kong, also made a weed garden for Bobo and taught him the little magic he knew. But one day Gary showed up again and told Bobo it was time for another adventure, telling him to go the north where there will be a town that is in need of him. Unfortunately this exit was not as quick as last time, so Bobo had to explain to DK why he had to go, and how when Gary says he needs to go somewhere, he must go there, after all that was how they met. After a long gorilla-hug-filled goodbye, with promises to return, Bobo set off on yet another adventure.It took almost a year, but one day, as Bobo was hotboxing a forest, a paladin showed up, asking for help with a town under attack. Bobo was unsure if this is what Gary wanted him to do, but nothing else occurred so this must be it. Little did he know this adventure would be nothing like his previous ones…All he knows is that there is one thing he wants, weed, and DK."9/17/2017 21:57:14,Dekan,Dragonborn ,Cleric ,Dekan calls himself Firebringer and believes he is called to judge the world and cleanse it with fire.

"9/18/2017 20:56:28,Kyburn ,Drow,Magus,"Born in the Underdark, he found himself wanting more of an existence than to live under an oppressive matriarchy, unfortunately, he had made an enemy of a noblemans son, who constantly made Kyburn's life hell. He would send all manner of Underdark creatures at him, forcing him to fight for his life. It wasn't until Kyburn was ready to leave the Underdark that the noblemans son himself confronted Kyburn, holding a blade to his throat. Kyburn was in a panic, and suddenly magic released itself from his hands, launching the noblemans son 30 feet away, knocking him out, and giving Kyburn something to think about as he left the Underdark, for the last time, he hoped."9/18/2017 12:35:36,"Taobthier ""Tobias"" Snäll",Drow,Cleric,"Taobthier is the son of the two escaped Drow slaves who abandoned their child on the doorstep of a Duergar couple to provide for him a better life. Taobthier took to going by Tobias (for ease) and lived a sheltered live. He was always aware of his upbringing, but was comfortable to live with two loving parents. He attended Duergar school, religious study, and even combat class. His adoptive father served in the Duergar military and taught his son many of the same tactics he learned.Given Tobias’ ancestry, he was denied entry to the Duergar military, but found a life with a weapon in hand natural. Still, at the behest of his mother, he joined the clergy instead. Unexpectedly, Tobias found a great connection in the clergy to the one called Adarrasa, God of Righteous Fury. The profound buried anger he felt at being abandoned was sensed by Adarrasa and Tobias went down the path of the cleric.Tobias was only content performing the rites for so long while the holy rage of Adarrasa boiled inside of him. After a time, he knew what his true calling was. Tobias became a mercenary, using his rage to pursue and cleanse the scum of Talem in holy fire. His contracts tended towards dealing with those most deserving of his rage. Soldiers of foreign wars that had submitted their lives in combat and elusive murderers were his most common targets.He swayed through the wrongdoers and vile of the world. It lead him on a path upwards, higher and higher from the underdark. The sinners up here were weaker and as vile as those down below, a pattern Tobias realized, so higher he went and more sinners he found. Soon he began hearing rumors of a ""surface world"" where no rock was above anyone's head and light shone from up high, above all. There were no tunnels and no shadow sinners could hide in, maybe he should pay this ""surface"" and its sinners a visit."9/18/2017 16:54:28,Lukas Christiansen,Drow,Rouge,"Born into slavery, Lael spent his early life as a servant for the lower priestesses of Lolth in the underdark city of Gallivak. For 70 years he has endured this life but then he began plotting his escape. It took 30 years for him to hide enough resources to survive out in the underdark after he escapes. The plan ran smoothly until he was spotted by the priestess he reported to directly. She said she knew he was planning on escaping and that she planned on killing him then and there but decided she would first take him back for punishment before killing him. After making him hand over all his weapons she began leading him back, knowing he wouldn't leave without his supplies. However, she didn't know that he had a dagger hidden behind his thigh, stabbed in there along the sinew so as to be easily concealed. In one quick motion, he painfully pulled out the dagger, flipped it into a downward hold, and stabbed straight into the priestesses neck. He grabbed his supplies and ran as fast as he could, knowing that even if she lived the priestess could not keep up with him. He was finally free.After a week of wondering the underdark, he found the entrance to the surface. Now that he was finally free he decided to rename himself Lukas Christansen. But he didn't stop there. He wanted to get as far away from Gallivak as possible. He stole coin at towns he came across to buy food, and food where he couldn't get coin. He did so for one month, until he came upon Neverwinter. There he lived on the streets, still stealing food, until he was approached by the local thieve's guild. He needed a source of income so he joined, albeit reluctantly and with the stipulation that he chooses the jobs he participates in. There he quickly rose to notoriety as a master assassin and thief. However, he could not play this part forever bc if he continued people would know that it was an elf behind the assassinations and thefts and as a Drow he would be the first to fall under suspicion. In addition to this, he never intended to work as a thief for very long anyways. He just wanted an average and modest life, free from slavery and entirely self-sufficient. Therefore, after 40 years of thieving, at age 140, he quit the thieve's guild, but not before one last job: stealing the 32nd Sapphire and the 16th Emerald, two powerful magical gems on display at the Neverwinter museum or arcana. This final job is what cemented both the funding for his new life and his legacy as the master rogue known to the public as ""22M"" bc all his thefts and assassinations were complete in under 22 minutes.He had only one love and that was a half-orc barkeep in Neverwinter named Garisson. Lukas was 160 when they met and for years, Lukas went to the tavern daily. Garrison took notice of this and a romance blossomed between the two for a time but Garrison felt Lukas was hiding too much from him and broke it off. They still think fondly of each other and say hello when they run into each other in town.Now, nearing 200, Lukas is an established part of the Neverwinter community, living the free life ha always dreamed of. There are those who are distrustful of a Drow living on the surface, and of Drow in general, but even for them Lukas seems to be an exception. He mostly keeps to himself. To everyone, he looks and is a model citizen, blissfully unaware of his grim past."9/18/2017 13:09:11,Sarafein Zerenith,Drow,Rogue,"The seventh daughter of House Zerenith, Sarafein learned self-reliance and cunning from the moment she was born. As a member of the tenth ranking House in the city of (whatever Underdark drow city exists in Scales of War), she had to deal with the constant treacherous machinations of House Phaerna, the eleventh House, as well as the internal power struggles between her sisters, all powerful and cruel priestesses of Lolth. Though her family banded together on the occasions when House Phaerna threatened, the majority of the time Sarafein was taught to distrust love and camaraderie, as they engender fatal weaknesses. In order to reinforce this idea, Sarafein’s sisters took turns tormenting their youngest sister, each coming up with tortures more malicious than the last.When Quelnira, the matron mother of House Zerenith, judged that her seventh daughter had learned these lessons well, Sarafein was brought to House Zerenith’s private chapel in order to dedicate herself to Lolth. It was during this ritual while the priestesses were distracted that House Phaerna attacked, and this time with mercenaries augmenting their forces. Though the men of House Zerenith rushed to defend the matron mother and her daughters, they had been caught unaware and the chapel was quickly overwhelmed. Sarafein’s sisters called upon Lolth to aid them in their fight, but there was no answer. House Phaerna’s consistent treachery coupled with the well-planned attack and interruption of the ritual had pleased the Spider Queen, and no help for House Zerenith would be forthcoming.From her position on the raised altar, Sarafein watched in stunned disbelief as her family was cut down by House Phaerna’s mercenaries. Frozen in place with fear, she finally snapped back to herself as the mercenaries approached the altar. Calling upon her own innate abilities instead of turning to a Goddess who had forsaken her family, Sarafein surrounded herself with an orb of darkness and slipped beneath the altar to a secret passageway that lead out of House Zerenith’s chapel. When the darkness cleared, the mercenaries could only look about in confusion, as the last surviving member of House Zerenith had disappeared.Using skills carefully honed during years spent avoiding her older sisters, Sarafein was able to sneak unseen to the walls surrounding House Zerenith’s compound, pausing only briefly to loot what was left of the House’s armory. After climbing the wall, Sarafein vaulted onto the narrow pathway at the top and was shocked to come face to face with a sentry set by House Phaerna. Without thinking, Sarafein lashed out, and was surprised to see a shadow seemingly breaking away from her own body to surround the guard. She thrust out towards the man simultaneously with her right hand, stabbing him straight through the eye with a blade she had hidden away. The scuffle alerted other guards along the wall who came running, and Sarafein had no choice but to jump off the pathway to the ground below. Landing in a roll, she quickly popped to her feet and ran blindly into the Underdark.After weeks spent hiding in the endless caverns and passageways of the Underdark, Sarafein stumbled upon a tunnel leading to the surface. Certain that whatever she would find in up there would be better than being found by House Phaerna’s scouts, she left the Underdark and the Goddess who had forsaken her behind without a backwards glance. Sarafein has since found her way to Overlook, where she works doing physical labor for a dwarven architect. Recently the architect asked her for help with a “special” job installing traps for some crazy man in a secret room built below the former Temple of Pelor. Sarafein spends her spare time exploring the rooftops and back alleys of her new town, memorizing possible escape routes, and learning more about Sehanine, intrigued by the Goddess' teaching to “seek your own destiny.”"9/18/2017 8:19:40,Arelkya T'Zytos,Drow,Ardent (Psionic Fighter),"Born into a noble Drow family, Arelkya had a very rough start. being male in a Lolthian society is not an easy life and being perceived as one was tantamount to being one. No manner of argument or behaviour would make her family accept her gender assertion; a cruel and fiercely matriarchal society had little tolerance for those such that would overreach their station. Nevertheless, her family indulged her tastes in feminine clothing and manner, considering it at least an admirable trait to have her ""mimic"" her ""betters"". Being an unusually kind and empathic soul, she was definitely considered a sort of pariah among society, compounded by the happenstance of her birth, this made Arelkya's life quite difficult, yet she held on to hope every day.As she grew older, she began repeatedly petitioning to any authority for trials or rituals to prove her womanhood, gaining the attention of an intrigued priestess. Her current stepfather J'ronis, was not at all pleased with this, seeing as Arelkya would potentially rise in station above him by being the firstborn daughter. Convincing her sister Phaedra of the danger Arelkya would pose to her status as well, making her the official second born daughter and destroying any claims as heir, they devised a plan to trick Arelkya and sold her into slavery.Confused, desperate and angry, she disavowed any ties to her old family and promised she would let them know just how angry if she ever encountered her stepfather and sister again. On a solitary road out of the Underdark, she was subjected to a harsh round of her daily taunting by her captors, regaling her with stories of all the horrible and vile things that would happen to her and her fellow captives once they arrived at the slave market. Filled with outrage and at the threshold of what she could endure, she focused all of her will and emotion into wanting the slavers to just leave them all alone and set them free. To her surprise a strange feeling overcame her and suddenly one of the slavers started walking out into the desolation.Starting a commotion about it, the others tried to after him while one tended the horses drawing the cage. Testing to see if if it was just a fluke, she concentrating on making the remaining slaver open their cage and sure enough, he suddenly got off the front carriage and unlocked the cage. Furious and confused, the other two slavers left their wandering idiot of a friend keep going on, unable to get him to stop and diverted their attention to the spontaneous ""liberator"" in their midst. the two slavers angrily questioned their friend's newfound altruism, all the while Arelkya smiled. ""what the bloody hell are you smiling at?"" said one of them. ""Oh, nothing..."" Arelkya said, ""Just that they are both plotting to kill you and take your cut of the profits, you really should kill THEM first"". With that last word, the slaver pulled out a dagger and started stabbing at the other two, starting a violent fight that distracted them from the slave cage. Slipping out and mounting the horse carriage, Arelkya grabbed the horse reins and rode them away as fast as she could, fellow prisoners in tow.Arriving in a safe town, where slavery is outlawed, she let all the captives out to seek their freedom, earning their respect and gratitude. One captive in particular, a gnome girl named Cyan Honeybud, became a friend of sorts to her and had asked for help in finding her family, so she may return to her home. Arelkya utilized her heightened empathic qualities, persuasion and newfound powers to make her way to Cyan's home town. After a tearful reunion with her father, Cyan thanked Arelkya and promised eternal friendship to her. Insisting that she receive payment for returning his precious daughter, Cyan's father gave Arelkya a decent sum of gold since he was the owner of the Honeybud Mead Brewery in town. ""You were really good at this whole finding things, helping people"" Cyan said, ""you could make a good living doing it. Lot's of folks out there could use the help. Avandra brought you to me, maybe She could bring you to others."" With tearful goodbyes and a decent amount of supplies (and rather tasty mead), Arelkya set out to make her own life in the world and Cyan's suggestion sounded like a really good start."9/18/2017 11:40:47,Hemlock Nightfire,Drow,Wizard,"JOURNAL ENTRIES(HEMLOCK NIGHTFIRE)My name is Hemlock, and I am my father’s heir.  This is a great honor as he has many daughters, some he has killed as he killed all of his sons.  The rumour is that his line is cursed to be betrayed and destroyed by their sons that they hold most dear.  In my grandfather’s case it certainly came true.  He finally believed the curse the day he died.  It was with my father’s dagger slicing his throat from ear to ear.  He denied it to the end, but in the end he believed.  My father believes, that is why he sacrifices the lives of all his male born children to his god.  That is why his heir is female.  He believes he controls us all.  If this belief is shaken he willingly sacrifices his daughters as well.  He believes that with the sacrifices he gains the favor and protection of his god. There are 2 reasons I am his heir.  First, I am far more studious than any of my half sisters.  They are more interested in styles, parties, men and silly gossip than in learning something useful.  2nd, he believes me completely under his thumb.  He does not think I could ever have the gall to betray him.  In this he is wrong.  I hate him and what he always has been.  Oh, I didn’t always feel this way and I certainly have no intention of dropping my shields enough for him to find out ever.  I have a habit of digging into old corners and nooks and crannies.  It has always caused him much amusement.  It also gives me access to knowledge no else has seen for centuries.  With this habit I have a good excuse for being gone for large amounts of time without anyone thinking anything of it.  I have found spell books and enspelled gems.  Many useful items have been uncovered which I have made use of.  I have managed to put together a traveling kit and stashed it outside the castle where it was easily retrievable if need be.  In a secret room, I found what I realized was my mother's sanctuary in this hell.  That is where I found her journal.  It was written to me as she realized that I would never know her.  In it was her story.  In it she told how she was a high-pristess of the Goddess Light.  In great detail it spoke of her beliefs and love for her goddess.  It told the tale of how a betrayal from a young accolate brought down the church in the middle of a ritual.  How the young accolate was in reality a spy for the Dark.  Paid lots of money for the betrayal and capture of the priestesses of Light.  The attack was thorough and every priestess was captured or killed.  There was specific instructions about my mother.  She alone was not to be killed no matter what.  The rest were to be killed if necessary.  The attack was organized and paid for by my father.  He wanted the high-priestess to be his personal mistress/servant/play toy.  The grand feeling of superioty over his god's enemy's high priestess was his for years.  He was enthusiastic and creative in his punishments and amusements.  She was the only slave preserved solely for his amusement.  If any of his guards or guests touched/talked/helped her they were sacrificed.  The rest of his slaves he toyed with, tortured for amusement, sold, killed or passed on without thought beyond his own amusement.  Her pain was exclusively his to enjoy and take power from.  That may be another reason I am his heir.  I am the only offspring that there is no chance that the father is not someone he sold my mother's services and pain to.  Stashed with the journal were a number of magic stones.  One of them cleansed my mind of my father's controlling spells that I was unaware of.  It gave me the memories of what happened to my mother as well as the atrocities he has committed on me.  Now, I know why the scars that cover my body are there.  They are not the price every magician must pay as he told me.  I have the memories of the rituals he has pulled my power for, and the gloating glory on his face as he tortured me numerous times for the fun of it.  The memories he wipes from me until he chooses to play again.  No wonder he has no doubt of my loyalty, he has had years of casting spells on me to the point that I would not even remember his abuses.   In me he gets the certainty of a blood heir that is not male and therefore cannot betray him, and the beauty of my mother and the same things he did to her he can do to me.  The journal told of how she had loved me and was surprised when he did not immediately have me taken to be raised as his daughter or sacrificed to his god.  Instead he left me with her to raise and love.  The horrors he did to her were far away from me.  How he enjoyed slicing her breast so he could drink the milk and blood of a nursing mother together.  He made sure that she produced enough milk for both of us.  Sometimes he would insist that she nurse me after lacerating both her breasts so that I would feed on blood and milk as well.  He said it would make me more powerful and useful in the future.  As I got older he insisted on me being fed on blood and milk more often.   He insisted on my being fed this way until I was 7.  The day he decided I needed to be weaned was the day my mother died.  He told her it was time to begin doing his rituals with both mother and me.  It would increase his power 10 fold to torture the mother and child.  He had taken her to his chambers as usual and begun by restraining her.  Then he had me delivered to his chambers as well.  He planned on using the power of her anger to fuel his latest spells as she watched him do to me what he had done to her for many years.  Her anger was greater than he expected.  He had forgotten that she was a high-pristess even if it was many years and abuses before.  She broke free of his spells and restraints and challenged him to a mageduel.  She fought him as no one ever had.  That is as close to dying as he has ever come.  For once he could not subdue her and was forced to slay her to save his life.  Since then I was allowed to keep the memories of being his heir.  The memories of his rituals and amusements he removed from my mind.  The stone also gave me the spell my mother used to protect herself from his controlling spells as well as how to keep this from him.  Another stone she had charged with all her memories of her life before.  As well as her memories of her time with me.  I knew how much she loved me and how she planned to take me to safety if she ever could.  She could have escaped shortly after she had me, but she refused to leave me behind.  So she made a stash of magical stones against the day of need.  I learned the rituals needed and was able to complete calling my familiar.  I have named her Kara.  She hides under the fall of my hair, along the back of my neck most of the time.  She is a Moon Wisp.  Many times has her light saved me from that which would be concealed by the moonlight.  She will definitely help me avoid enemies at night when I leave this place.  She is mischievous and protective, for all that she is young.  She tries to help all she can.  Her presence alone can make me smile, which in this place is a great boon indeed.  She has helped me find the knowledge I need since I bonded with her.  She has a knack for locating the information buried in the tomes my family has amassed from all over GrayHawk that will be the most useful to me.  She even has a habit of disguising her self as a tome, to hide from my father and to keep up my appearance as nothing more than a book worm.  It is working, he does not believe I have any useful skills at all.  Nor does he believe I have any desire to leave the library at all.  He thinks I fear the outdoors as he has never found me outside even.  It will serve me well.  It is always better to be under estimated by your enemies.  The stones also gave me the information about her goddess.  I believe her goddess is preferable to the Dark God of my Father.  Since my discovery of the stones I am aware that I am not as enthused with the pain and suffering of others that the Dark demands.  I dare not say this aloud but my goddess is the goddess of my mother.  I must escape this prison before I am found out by my father.  I can not stand this place with my true knowledge of what it is.  I have made a plan and I will take the stones my mother made and all of the stashes that she made as well as the ones I myself made.  I have been practicing and training myself in secret since I found my mother's retreat.  There is enough room within that I can even practice with a sling that she managed to hide within it.  It will give me a offense that I can use from a distance when I leave.  I have practiced as much as I can daily since then.I will go to the surface and seek out other followers of the Goddess of Light.  I will tell them of my mother and how her faith never wavered.  My understanding is limited, I don't know how the goddess could turn her back on a follower as faithful as my mother.  I will tell them of her, but I will not join them, she would like me too I'm sure.  My love does not go that far though.  I will not spend my life in the priesthood of a goddess that allows her loyal followers to suffer so.  Instead I intend to travel and learn of the world at large.  My future is to be found beyond the horizon, not in my father's home.  If ever I come back it will be to destroy him utterly....... I am writing this as I sit by my camp.  I have finally escaped.  I have been on the run for 2 wks now.  I have been traveling at night and making as much time as I can.  However, I am hampered in that I must travel at early morn, evening and night.  I cannot bear the sunlight of full noon.  I have spent all of my life inside during daylight as my father hid us all.  We are all magic users of the arcane, not divine magics.  This is not something that I can afford to advertise as all hate and fear us since the wars.  I have not escaped Hell to be hung by the small minded ignorant yokals.I hide by day and rest when I can.  I have killed 2 parties of assasins sent by my father.  I have been in battle with a number of creatures as well.  I write so if something happens to me, someday my story may be found and brought to a temple of Light.  It is the story of my mother as well.  If you find this I beg you to take it to a temple of Light so they will know the honour and fate of my mother.  It was her wish that her story be returned to her sisters in the temple so they would know and take strength from her courage.There is a disturbance in the woods. I must check it out in case it is another assassin sent by my father.  I will climb the tree near the edge of the camp.  I will wait and see if they are friend or foe......  Well, what do you know,  just as I was running low on fresh meat a boar just happens to be in the area and hunting for grubs.  I decided to use the element of surprise and jumped him with my sword.  I got a good lick in and it totally enraged him.  He let out a screech of outrage and charged.  I just kept slicing him up and jumping out of his way. It took awhile but he finally screamed his last and collapsed.  Even then I made sure to slit his throught and bleed him dry.  I just stood there for a second and took a deep breath.  I felt so alive, I laughed aloud.  The thrill of hunt was still running thru me.  I felt like trying to resurrect him to kill him again just for the adrenalin rush.  I never noticed how much fun danger is until the first group of assassins sent by my father tried to kill me.  Since then I enjoy the thrill of danger,  just seconds away from death myself.  I don't necessarily like the killing itself, but the quickening of my reflexes and the wonderful knowledge that I can defend myself.  That is what is almost like an entire bottle of fine elven wine.  I spent far to long feeling helpless to ever want to do so again.     I will have to find someone I can trust to guard my back soon though.  It is impossible to go forever without proper rest.  Hopefully they can become a partner to share my explorations with.  I tire of being the only one in range of my voice.  Journeys are far more fun with a friend.  There is a town that is only a day from here,      .  I will go there to hire a guard, at least then we can sleep in shifts.  Father is limited on those he can send after a female once I am known.  He cannot afford to be known as a spell caster or he will himself become hunted.  If it is found that he uses spells to control others his fine home will be overrun with masses of those lost in a mob's rage.  He may worship the Dark God, however he is not a priest, his power is not granted by his God.  He has no protection against those who fear all magic users.  Whether the mobs would free or kill my sisters, at least they will be free of his torment.  I will have to think further on the idea of leading his enemies to his door.Meanwhile I need funds.  I have enough for now it is true.  However I have no intention of living in the woods forever.  I will earn my own way.  I should be able to find work in the town.  There is bound to be someone in need of the skills I have.  Even beyond magic I have quite a few.  I have been practicing and training all I could for years.  Before I found my mother's hideaway even.  It will be far safer for me to use all I can, besides magic for as long as I can contrive to do so.  "9/18/2017 16:17:22,"Chakos Quilfein (""Arthur Quilfeather"")",Drow Elf,Bard/Necromancy Wizard,"Chakos was born in a major city in the Underdark to a large family, where he spent most of his young life.

While he did not abandon the arts of magic, he pursued an archaeological lifestyle instead. He worked tirelessly to uncover lost spells and artifacts, and over time found himself working in demon magics. To him it was worth the taboo opinions of his colleagues. It was history! If our ancestors practiced this it should be studied and understood. The practice of it could be carefully supervised, but the historical society wouldn't have any of it. Demonology was dead. It had been dead for centuries and would remain dead for many reasons. Arkul was given a couple warnings by close colleagues, but he wasn't the type to have many friends.

Knowing the risk of traveling on common Sembia roads, the Silver Raven company took the caravan down a secret path only known/commonly traveled by them. While on the path, they were ambushed by a large group of raiders. Elfrum, having a passion for protection, leapt for the chance at defending this caravan. He fought valiants beside his brothers in arms, until he was betrayed by one of them, literally stabbing Elfrum in the back, leaving him to die.

He left the Silver Ravens on his own quest of finding answers to his questions, which brought him to Ordulin. It was an unnamed jewel to me and my company since it was pretty much just another job to us.

With the mines, the sawmill and the workshops nearby, Bjorn seldom had time to do much else than picking herbs and healing the sick and injured.One day, when Bjorn was spending a day in the small gallery of his own pit, the ceiling collapsed in a cacophony of groaning stone and splintering timbers. Trapped and half-buried, he was alone. As the hours passed and delirium set in, Bjorn gradually began to accept the futility of hope. But then with the gentleness of a dawn breeze, he saw dim light trickling in through the top of the rubble, and his limbs flushed with renewed strength. He began to shift rocks – gingerly at first, and then with urgency – until he could free himself and lie gasping on the grass outside the mine's door. In the cold, clear autumn air he wondered: what whispered to his being down in the darkness? Was it his failing body's final call to action, or was it something more – more mysterious and more powerful?Such thoughts came back to him over the following months, when he noticed that the bones of his patients knitted faster and their wounds soured less often. Worried for his own sanity and hungry for answers, he left his village. What had happened in the pit? Was it delirium down there, or a new god? The hills of his homeland could only tell him so much.

I would spend 30 years at the forge, hearing of the deeds of the Hammers and the Majesty of the Allhammer himself. I began talking to the other Clansman as well. It was here I saw the truth about my Clan, about what we really were. I knew we were low, but if only 1 percent of things I was being told about my Clan were true, we were in fact the lowest. Others would mock me with these facts, my time in Blackrock was lonely with few friends or celebrations. I vowed that when I returned home, I would leave the Clan and cut ties for the rest of my life. Unfortunately, I never got that chance. For when I arrived 30 years later, I had just missed the massacre of my family. A week before, the other Lords of Stonemire used a worker’s strike to mount a coup and take over their business. There were no survivors but I. I did not feel saddened by their deaths. I was instead saddened that I'd never be able to tell them how horrible they were. So, I buried what I could find of them and said a short prayer to the Allhammer and left. They were my kin after all. As I left a thought came to my mind. I was free from their name. And I could make it my own. The Strongarm's of the past were all gone. I'm the only one to survive and I can do anything I wish with it. I feel no hatred for their killers. If it wasn't them that day, it would have been someone else later. I forgive them and leave their judgement to the Allhammer. So, I will raise up the name, build it upon a sturdy foundation of decency and respect. Use the timbers of truth and stone of honour to build its walls. And it will rejoice in the flames of the Allhammer's Soul forge for eternity.

We were more prosperous, to be sure, but the Halfling's sister Anelia was what had the most effect on me.We fell in love instantly and married within a year of meeting each other. Her only demand was that I leave the fighting behind. She had no stomach for violence and couldn't stand the thought of growing old with someone who fought like I did. For a while it wasn't too hard. I focused more on helping at the smith, but over the years the restlessness returned. Even the birth of our daughter Vinna wasn't enough to quell the urges I felt.When the rebellion started and the opportunity to regain our name was offered, my brothers were the first to sign up. I barely cared about the rebellion and didn't have any real connection to the home we'd left behind so long ago, but I joined anyway. I told Anelia it was for my family but really it was because I wanted to pick up my hammer again. She didn't buy it, or maybe she didn't care. We argued for days before I simply packed up and left.I played a very small part in the war. My brothers and I being relegated to supporting the true, honorable warriors. But when our camp was attack we took up arms just the same and were captured along with the rest of them. When the rebellion ended and we returned, bearing the brand that each captured soldier received, the Dwarven high clans begrudgingly upheld their end of the deal and restored my family's name. My father and the two brothers who survived the rebellion returned to (Dwarf city) immediately, but I went back to (nearby town), expecting my wife and daughter to welcome me with open arms.Arl told me that, while I was gone, Anelia and Vinna were caught up in one of the many anti-dwarf riots that occurred during the rebellion, and were both killed. Enraged, but not wanting to dishonor her memory, I fled the town and made it five miles into the wilderness before letting loose. Decades passed in a blur of violence, rage, and squalor. I had taken up with a group of bandits who raided caravans when my life changed for a second time. We attacked a small group of what we thought would be easy prey, but turned out to be clerics to the god of war and conflict. They easily repelled us, but while the rest of my group ran away I stayed and fought. They must have seen something in me because, after knocking me unconscious, I awoke in their camp, being tended to by their medic. They were impressed by my ferocity but dismayed at my lack of control.The clerics brought me into the fold and taught me that my strength could be put to righteous aims. They taught me to temper my fury and unleash it only when needed. In essence, they taught me how to live with myself.  After traveling with them for many years I decided to return to the town and seek out Arl and make amends if I could. I found him at the end of his life, desperately hoping to see me again so that he could apologize.He told me that Anelia and Vinna hadn't died during the rebellion, though he hadn't heard from them since. Anelia had left and taken Vinna with her. She felt betrayed by my choice to fight instead of stay with her, and when Arl defended me, she took that as a sign that he valued business over family. He said that it was true, he didn't want to offend my father and lose their partnership. He didn't know that my father would leave the town as soon as he was able, with little regard for the business they had built together. When I returned, Arl was in financial ruin and lashed out at me, lying about Vinna and Anelia to hurt me.I don't know where they are or if either of them are still alive, though Anelia would be quite elderly for a Halfling by now, but I intend to find them. If my daughter is alive, I plan on making up for all of the years I missed. If my wife is alive, I don't know how I'll react. I understand her frustration with me, but I have trouble with the idea of forgiving her for taking our daughter. For now the only goal is to find them, and do good on my path."9/17/2017 21:24:49,Meleskith Hilldelver,dwarf,druid,"Meleskith was born Lorrean Farrower to a family of farmers in the Blacktree community. She was the youngest of 6, and though she helped with the farm as they all did, her age and small size (she was particularly short and somewhat underweight as a child) excused her from some of the heavier work. Whenever that happened, or when her work was finished, she slipped away to go visit their neighbors’ horses, or the sheep that grazed over the hill past their lands, or to look for rabbits or toads or other critters by the creek behind the barn.Then, her magic started to trigger. The wheat grew taller where she walked, the garden she tended bore larger vegetables, though they turned sour when she was in a bad mood. Her father was thrilled. The Temple of the Blinding Light always welcomed more clerics to spread order in Pholtus’ name, which would not only mean one less daughter to feed, but would also increase his standing in the community, which held Pholtus and his temple in high esteem. Her mother was not happy with this plan. Of the six, there were only two girls, and Lorrean’s older sister was already married. She finally agreed, however; after all, to serve Pholtus was a high honor, and the temple would undoutedly manage to teach the girl not to be so wild. Lorrean overheard them come to their agreement, and was horrified. She did not like their visits to the temple, strict and quiet and perfectly clean. She did not like the clerics who kept the temple and scolded her for dirty feet and talking too much at all the wrong times and coming in with leaves in her hair. She did not want to leave home and her siblings--especially the youngest of her brothers, Dundrig, who played games with her when his work was done. But if she had to leave, she was certainly not going to serve Pholtus.She stowed away in the next trade wagon passing through, abandoned it by a river, and slowly wandered her way out of the farmlands and into the forests. In her loneliness, and desperate wishing for one of her brothers to be with her, her magic called up an animal companion, a badger she called Skur. Together, they found a badger set willing to take them in for awhile. The badgers called themselves the Hilldelver Set, so Lorrean became Meleskith Hilldelver. She and Skur learned to hunt and scavenge, and the badgers taught her to pull in her magic and bend it through leaf and root as a druid does--though animal magic is not like human magic, animals use it the way druids do. It was a rough education, but functional enough.She made contact with the other druids of the forest, the fire brigade. Having lived with badgers for a couple years by then, and having been a farmer before, she did not fit in. Then there was a small incident, a minor experiment with a fire spell--which did not go wild, whatever the supervisor might say to the contrary--and she decided that if they were going to lay down all these rules and try to control her, they were hardly better than Pholtus’ followers.When the Set decided it was time for her to move on--as all grown cubs must--she turned to the towns nearby, then to the cities. Since she had not fit in as a druid, she sought to make her way as a craftsperson, shaping wood and clay to useful things. But she bored quickly with useful things, and decided to try her hand at art instead. It seemed like a good idea at the time.She tried very hard, and was very invested in her art--half-abstract things that felt like a thing’s magic more than looked like it’s shape, made of stone and wood bent and woven, or of a living plant growing through a stone shell. Her work did not catch on.Finally, after many years’ effort, she gave in, and accepted (a little bitterly) that her chosen path was not working out. She had been doing odd jobs to survive--repairs, seasonal farm work, digging cellars. Though she still used her druid magic, she never made her living by it. If she were more honest than usual, she might admit that she was afraid that her magic would be rejected as her art was, or that she was afraid her work elsewhere as a druid might backfire or blow up in her face as her stint in the fire brigade had (if not so literally). While Meleskith struggled to find her place in the world, her place in the Temple of the Blinding Light, to which she had already been pledged before she made her escape, was filled by Dundrig Farrower. Though he had little magic himself, his farmer’s muscles turned well to wielding a hammer in battle. Once his training at the temple was complete, he was assigned to a pair of clerics, to help them carry Pholtus’ law to the unbelievers, to bring order to chaos, and to smite evil with the blinding light of Pholtus’ glory.If he is disappointed that he did not get to live out a quiet life at home, tending to his fields and raising a family of his own, he knows better than to let on to the zealots he works with."9/18/2017 9:02:32,Thordren Silverheart,Dwarf,Bard,"Thordren, the first son of Thonrin and Tena Silverheart was born on the floor of Silverstout brewery.  Thonrin was clan leader and Tena Master Brewer. Unbending as dwarves can be his mother had refused to leave her work up and to the day Thordren blessed the world, having been quoted saying, “Nor Battle, Nor Bairn, Nor Quake kenne keep me outta tha Brew”.  It was this clandestine birth that set young Thordren, unbeknownst to him at the time, toward his destiny and eventual fate.Uncommon to their dwarven kin the Silverheart family traveled frequently to trade and sell the infamous wares of their brewery.  Mostly under the protection of Tena and her staff, clan matters keeping Thonrin largely at home.  It was on these trips that Thordren became enamored with the wider world, and the cultures he met along the way. The Silverhearts had a reputation and Tena was primarily responsible.  Thordren would often accompany her on business deals and would sit and listen as his mother wove wild tales of Adventures and myths, legends and monsters and he would be there after the deals were “signed” to clean up the mess. It was no surprise when Thordren asked to apprentice at his mother’s side, much to the dismay of his father.  Under his mother’s tutelage he developed a natural talent for brewing and became quite skilled in its consumption.  Thordren loved his time at the Brewery he felt at home among the masters and understood almost innately how each ingredient influenced and enhanced the spirits and brews that were famous to the Silverstout.  This complex understanding lent its way into Thordrens second love, the way of the song.  Amongst the vats of boiling liquids and within the bars and taverns he visited as he grew up, he came to learn that with beer came song and with song came pure joy.  It didn’t take too long for his mother to notice that on business dealings in which Thordren accompanied her contracts and profits doubled.  It was on one of these trips, dealing with a nearby elvish settlement that Thordrens voice caught the eye of the local Lord and won him acceptance into a prestigious elven Bardic College.  At the adolescent age of 45 Thordren embarked on his first adventure away from his family and Kin.College among the elves was strange at first.  Being a dwarf amidst elves left him isolated and often cast out from social gatherings, but he quickly overcame the adversity and soon his wit charm and skill had him accepted with the elvish community.  Thordren lived with laughter in his heart and he excelled in his schooling there wasn’t and instrument he couldn’t play, and song he couldn’t sing, a tale he couldn’t weave and an elf he couldn’t outdrink.  It was during his fourth year that he met Maethil’wyn Talanmyr.  Maethil’wyn was an elven girl of high standing and a bardic student at the college her and Thordren attended.  Thordren was smitten almost instantly, his history and experiences of traveling with his parents had chipped away at the natural mistrusting nature of dwarfs, and he found Mae fascinating.  Mae was nothing but trouble in her own right as her tendency for mischief and almost instance acceptance of other races set her in opposition of the natural xenophobia of her elven counterparts.  They met during a heated drinking competition, which Thordren had started with his big mouth.  It would end horribly for him the minute Mae entered.  (I imagine the Marion drinking scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark).  From that moment on the two became an inseparable pair of trouble and mayhem. (Thordren never confessed his feelings for Mae but remained infatuated)Once graduated the two decided to be a duo of sorts and traveled all around the country side as a Bardic duo, Mae often using mainly her voice and Thordren providing the musical background.  They became quote renowned for their performances as well as the wake they left in town, taverns and bars. They had earned enough renown over two years that they drew the attention of a Prominent Elven Lord that they were invited to stay on as employed performers for the court.  Mae took a keen interest in this contract while Thordren was iffy. During their year of employment Mae grew increasingly less interested in mischief and rambunctious behavior.  (I like to think the Elves have a sort of Rumspringa for the youth to experience some things outside of elven culture but to return to the fold.  Thordren has a limited understanding of this and feels that he can sway her, and Mae assumes he has understood her explanations.) Eventually tensions between the two grew as Mae became more and more interested in the affairs of the court than the performing and rowdy nightlife.  On the day that Mae was considered an adult her father came to announce that she was to be betrothed to the son of the Lord. Thordren was beside himself with anger frustration and confusion.  He engaged Mae in a heavy argument about their relationship and his understanding of things as she relayed with cool elven diplomacy the true nature of who they were, duty bound her to her family and her time for fun was at an end.  Thordren stormed out, resigning his position and drowned his sorrows in the local tavern, his whole world having been shattered. The events of that night are not very clear to Thordren.  He had never really felt anger before, his whole life and been surrounded by people who were generally happy, intoxicated or a lovely mixture of both.  His parents were merry folk and the patrons of Silverstout brewery were mostly equally as merry.  Having the nature tendencies for bardic optimism it had never even occurred that he and Mae might end or that his story might end in misery.  He had spent his first 50 years of life thinking he was the hero of his story and that there would be nothing but happy endings.  Too far into the drink to realize the consequences of his action Thordren set his mind to getting back his happy ending.Storming into the Lords mansion Thordren set to finding the young Lords son, who in his eyes was the sole person responsible for the loss of Mae and Thordren’s current predicament.  Upon finding him in the mansion gardens sitting with Mae, Thordren lost what little sense he had left.  Remembering a spell he learned about he attempted to Dominate the mind of Mae’s betrothed, to great misfortune.  The spell being beyond the ability of Thordren himself but fueled by his anger managed to connect, instantly the dwarf became aware of the thoughts and feeling of the elf, in his rage Thordren will him to forget all about Mae, to leave them alone and never bother them again.  His control of the spell was weak and Mae’s attempted dispel created a magical backlash sending the dwarf and elf into unconsciousness.When Thordren awoke he was in his home among the Hill dwarfs, sober and foggy as to how he got there.  He would later learn about his attempts at mind control and the assault of the Lords son. The Elf had suffered severely and was still in a coma, but hopes were high that mages would eventually set him right.  The elven lord had advocated death for Thordren’s assault but he was returned to dwarven land to face dwarven justice.  To save the reputation of his clan a deal was made that Thordren would be banished from his homeland never again able to return.  And so it was that at the age of 52 Thordren was ejected from his family and his people.For 23 years Thordren wandered the lands, playing for taverns and keeps, lords and villagers. He kept his shame a secret and hid his pain with loud laughter and raucous behavior.  He swore again to never act out in anger and to remain true to his upbringing.  His only therapy and redemption for the heartache he caused his family and clan was his ability to bring happiness and joy to those who would listen to his songs and laugh at his performances.  During the early years of his exile Thordren’s penchant for trouble earned him a nemesis in another traveling bard/thief, the two often encountered each other along the road and would wither end in brawls or gambling losses.  In one of these battles Thordren lost a lute, given to him my Mae, in a bet in which his nemesis cheated.  He is bound and determined to get it back from him the next time he finds him.Meeting Aldric StormcrowNear his 65th nameday (Early-thirties for a dwarf) Thordren was participating in a rather intense contest of wills with the Tavern Owner when he overheard a patron mentioning having spotted a group of Flumphs in a cave outside of town.  This piqued Thordren’s interest.  Flumphs, normally reserved to living in the Underdark had always intrigued Thordren.  The only nice and relatively peaceful thing to come from the bowels of the Underdark Flumphs were truly ridiculous to behold.  Many a tale of the wonders of “Flumph Flipping” had been told to him by his uncle and Thordren had always wanted to experience this wonder for himself.  Excited by the opportunity Thordren quickly left the tavern to find the Flumphs.  Wandering drunkenly into the cavern Thordren found the Flumphs in a very agitated state, and proceeded to agitate them further.  In a drunken stupor Thordren began to wildly flip the Flumphs over, this being easy to do as Flumphs float on jets of air that they suck in through their mouths and expend through their tentacles. His joy was heightened by finding out that make a sort of slide whistle sound as they flip.  Careless of the repercussions of his actions Thordren quickly learned that while mostly peaceful Flumphs still have some defenses.  One Flumphs stink spray is enough to nearly incapacitate a normal person, and that night Thordren was hit by no less than 8.  Completely drunk and delirious from the smell Thordren discovered the reason for the Flumphs abnormal existence above the Underdark.  Thordren awoke a little more sober and a lot more stinky to being tied up and in the company of two trolls 6 goblins and a Bugbear, who had been happily hunting Flumphs and stumbled across him.  Aldric Stormcrow had been traveling in the area on contract to kill the Bugbear leader when the smell of the dwarf had caught his attention.  Once freed and enemies killed Thordren pledged himself to Aldrics side in offer of repayment.	Much to Aldrics dismay this would not be the last time he had to bail Thordren out of a deadly incident. What was supposed to be a yearlong pledge ended up turning into a 10 year friendship of adventure? Facts Thordren Keeps Secret:Only Aldric knows the shame of his banishment in any detail.Thordren keeps a lock of Mae’s hair, a gift given to him in friendship on graduation.Thordren says his Clan name was Silverheart but it is really Silverstout he changed it to keep from further shaming his clan and their product.Thordren keep his emotions in an almost dangerous check.  He never seems to let his anger out, being afraid of how things will turn out.  He hides it all with a jovial positive upbeat attitude.  No one knows the true pain and shame he feels.Thordren does not know what happened to Mae and her betrothed, as he avoids the areas near his homeland.Thordren has twin younger brothers both Clerics and a younger sister who is a monk.Silverstout brewery survived the scandal and is still a popular brewery.

He was born in a small elf village to parents in the middle of the power hierarchy. By a strange coincidence upon Aelar's 25th birthday, a wizard who had previously resided in the village, Adorellan Xyrphine, returned and asked for an apprentice to assist him at his tower. Many elvish parents offered their children to him, but he choose Aelar because he ""looked bored."" After returning to the tower, fresh apprentice in tow, Adorellan began teaching Aelar the art of the arcane. Seven years later, after a lecture was interrupted by the sudden heaving of bloody vomit, Adorellan revealed he was dying of a mysterious curse he received while researching his life's work, the creatures of the lower planes. The curse was resistant all the forms of removal attempted; the most that could be done was slow its progress. As it continued to ravage his body Adorellan concocted a plan: acquire an apprentice, train them all he could in his limited time, reveal his plight, and then seal himself himself away with an “Imprison” spell, locked away by a phrase only his apprentice would know, until the time came that the curse was identified and a cure found. With the parting words of “continue my research” the wizard removed himself from the flow of time until the fated day that Aelar succeeds in his quest. After 140 years of traveling to countless libraries and obtaining any and all information relating to this curse and more generally the lower planes, Aelar realized the easiest way to learn more of them was to encounter the creatures of it in person. Taking the basic knowledge of magic his master had taught him and his desire to learn more of all creatures, Aelar looked for a sufficiently desperate party that was willing to let him join until he came across as strange man with a lisp."9/18/2017 16:23:16,Bethshaia Katiyn d'Hiveryn,Elf,Ranger,"In the far north, beyond the mountains called Kinbizah, where humans have long since turned back, and dwarves give up, and goblins stubbornly freeze to death, there in the gaping caldera of an ancient dead volcano lies the great lake of Othavar, and the hidden city of Hiveryn, domain of the Snow Elves. Like lost Shangri-La (from The Lost Horizon), or forgotten Gondolin (from The Silmarillion), it is here the Snow Elves make their way isolated from the world around them.And from this land comes forth Bethshaia Katiyn D’Hiveryn (or “Shay”) on a quest to save her people from certain doom.  The youngest daughter of the great Elven House of Katiyn, her mother is a grande-dame of Hiveryn society, and her father a great military hero of the city. Though estranged from her mother, Shay is the apple of her father’s eye.  She has two brothers, Ivan-Athur and Wolf, close in age, and together the three of them were the holy terrors of a generation, constantly out baiting yetis (the Snow Elf equivalent of cow-tipping.) and generally causing mischief.  She has an older half-sister, Gineva, (from her mother’s first marriage), with whom she does not get along, and a younger half-elven brother, Thordred, (supposedly her father’s illegitimate son) who lives with human barbarians in the mountains further south.Threatened with the prospect of a political marriage arranged by her mother, Shay joined the Elven Guard, and requested the furthest away posting she could get, the Monastery of Nikolaus D’Myra in the frozen tundra-lands of the North.  There she rose to prominence as an archer of the “Prima Sagittariora Borealis”, the elite legion defending that sacred site, and she served there for 10 years. Then, one night, on the last watch, she was struck with a mighty vision: She saw her beloved Hiveryn buried under impenetrable sheets of steel-gray ice, devoid of elvenkind, lost to the world forever.  And through this vision rang the name “Slater Fane”.  She had no idea who this was, or what was his(?) role in bringing this fate about, but she was certain that he must be found.She returned to Hiveryn and spoke her vision to Elsa Snow-Crystal, the Queen of the Snow Elves.  The Queen gave her blessing and leave to go from the hidden city and seek out this person in the wide world.  So, under her mother’s glaring eye, she departed the city, traveling with her brothers Wolf and Ivan as far as the human barbarian camp, then onward with Thordred to the outskirts of the lands of Hythvick.  There, he told her, he was not allowed to enter.  So, she went in by herself…"9/18/2017 10:57:27,Tasar,Elf,Fighter,"	Tasar was born into the noble family of Gor.

She never learned which lady was her mother, but was raised communally by all the women. By the age of fourteen she had decided that she did not want their kind of life for herself, and ran away to live on the streets. It only took one night of carelessness for her to lose what few possessions she had brought from the brothel, and she found herself scrounging refuse heaps just to survive. As a result, she learned to sleep with all she owns wrapped in a bundle in her arms.After several weeks of living in alleyways and fighting other vagrants for scraps of food, Lysariel was discovered, gaunt and shivering, outside of The Stag at Bay by Thalon Elendiir. Taking pity on the younger girl, he brought her back to the rooftop hideout of a small group of guttersnipes. Thalon and the other children took turns teaching Lysariel the “code” of the streets, which mainly consisted of who to respect, who to avoid, and when to look the other way. She also learned of hidden ways through the urban sprawl of Everlund, how to secretly pocket items when no one was looking, and (perhaps the most important) how to make a quick escape. Lysariel adapted easily to the group’s guidelines, and always shared her finds of food and copper with them as a way of showing her gratitude.Ten years later, Lysariel found herself in the garrison headquarters for the Army of the Vale. Exposure to the elements, severe poverty, and enduring illness had driven her to desperation and she yearned to find a better life. At the age of twenty-four she was physically mature for an elf, but was otherwise still considered a child, and it took a good deal of persuasion (and quite a few lies) to convince the recruitment officer to allow her to sign up for the army. She was placed as a scout beneath the leadership of Adran Veladorn, a cleric of Torm.Though Adran was less strict than most followers of Torm, working with him came as something of a shock to Lysariel after living so long on the street. In addition to reading and writing, formal military training, tactical maneuvers, and field medicine were practices she had never considered she would learn. Adran also tried to discourage her from some of her less honest habits, though when pressed he admitted such skills did came in handy for scouts. She was careful to hide her own religious beliefs from him, however, as she doubted her occasional donations to the Church of Mask would be taken lightly.After five years of routine patrols along the Everlund to Sundabar trail escorting merchant trade caravans, the duo was dispatched as agents of the Army of the Vale to the town of Westerville. Adran’s commanding officer had heard rumors of problems with the newly discovered silver mines, and wanted the two to follow up. When Adran decided to return to Everlund after issues with the locals, Lysariel took advantage of his departure to send her resignation of commission back with him. Becoming an adventurer sounded much less restrictive… and more lucrative, to boot."9/17/2017 18:37:39,Kerasian Garivel,Elf,Paladin,"Kerasian is the youngest member of the noble merchant house of Garivel, the only son of the current head of the house, Lady Naireema Garivel. Having four elder siblings Keras was unlikely to inherit so he was promised at the young age of 75 to the local chapter of the Order of the Golden Lion in Alaghôn, the capital city of Turmish. Until that point, Keras had been the definition of rich idleness, content to lounge in the family manor and spend his night cavorting and gambling amongst others of his station. Once inducted as a Paladin of Torm, however... he remained much the same, the addition of a few hours spent training to appease his family.Several decades passed in this way, with only the changing fashions favored by the young wastrel marking the passage of time before something spurred him into action. Word passed through the Order's barracks (which were frequented by Keras only on the rare days he tired of the gambling house) that one of the senior administrators of the chapter would be retiring in the coming weeks. Believing himself a shoo-in, due to his family's many contributions to the Order, both as members and as patrons over the centuries, Keras met with the head of Alaghôn's chapter and went on at length on his devotion to the tenets of the Order and his desire to do more, all without mentioning his interest in the position explicitly, trusting in the man to read between the lines and offer him the cushy desk job, and the prestige that came with it, on the spot.Reading between the lines, however, is not exactly a tenet espoused by Torm's paladins, and the head paladin, so moved by Keras' passionate words, proclaimed the young elf to be the very model of a paladin and that his talents were being wasted in Alaghôn. Before Keras could get a word in edgewise the elder paladin ordered him to pack his bags and set out into the world, to fight injustice and be a beacon in the name of Torm for the world to see.Keras tried in vain to reverse this decision, pleading with his mother to write to the head paladin, but his cries fell on deaf ears. Naireema, tiring of her son's incessant idleness, agreed with the head paladin's decision, if not his reasoning. Going out into the world and adventuring as his forefathers would be good for him, she proclaimed, and so she handed over the holy symbol carried by the first member of their house to join the Order and bundled him out of their manor so fast that he barely had an opportunity to say farewell to his sisters. With a final, genuine plea from his mother to bring honor to his family, Keras was cast out of his family home and into the metaphorical, and eventually literal, wilds.Keras has been on the road for just under a year at this point and is still naive about much of the world. He knows a surprising amount about trade thanks to his family's connections, but in terms of 'useful' knowledge, he is wholly unprepared. As well, he is unused to encountering poverty in his daily life and is incredibly uncomfortable with it. He has a bit of a gambling addiction but is smart enough to recognize it and tries to curb those impulses most, but not all, of the time."9/18/2017 11:48:38,Lorac Nightson,Elf,Wizard,"JOURNAL ENTRIES(   lorac  nightson  ) i was  an  elven  servator  that  detested  being what he  was  and  that  they  would  not  let  him  advance  any  higher  first  level  apprentice  mage  that was to learn no more than serve in his masters.  the onlyreason that they taught him magic was because of his blood line. (to make up for families the treacherous evil acts.)  when he was a child  before he was put into servitude he overheard bites of a conversation that lead to him becoming a servitor.         the reason they taught him magic was to have control over his magic. for him the magic was like candy and he never got enough of it. at times when he was a child it really got out of control. one day he got stressed out and left the house for a while. he went to the forest and was  called by the magic and couldn’t help, but follow the song. and follow he did to a cave protected by magic that for some reason let him pass. as he ascended into the cave the song carried him to the darkest part of the cavern. and suddenly light shot from a corner of the room and lite up a part of the cavern. revealing an alchemist laboratory with four books left on a table in the center of the room and looked through the first three and found low level spells. yet when he looked through the forth, he could not understand such magic as of yet was sure that someday he could master it. then a soothing female voice then told him to take them and learn all he could. he then placed them in his bag and spent the night in the cavern. he awoke in the night to a humming sound coming from a part of the cavern. he stood and walked to the sound and found on a wall part of a scripture and a staff in a stand and it read ”he who is of the blood of the kin this blade will protect and destroy all others who try to weild it. then he touched the staff and it disapeared. he then left the cave and went back to the manner feeling safe and protected.           when he returned to the household of his master. he was confronted with another of the servators and told to report the location of where he had went. so they took him to the masters chamber. when the master asked where he was. he said he went for a walk and came back.  then the master said what is this.and took the bag from him and dug through it. when he touch the book he thought was useful. and the master took out the book and had a horrid look appeared across his face and turned to stone. he took the book from the stone hand and fled. coming across the guards at the front gate. they stopped him and pulled there weapons. then a flash of light appeared and he saw the guards on the ground dead  with a sword in his hand. it turned into a staff and he used it a walking staff. after a few years of wandering the strange voice returned and told him about the staff and through dreams he learned to use it.         now he serches the land to increase his knowledge and power."9/18/2017 10:13:14,Rhydian Ty'aer,Elf,Rogue,"Rhydian is the child of Tegerin and Rheala of the old and well respected elven house Ty 'aer. Along with his three siblings, Rhoana, Ciara, and Tián; Rhydian grew up at his father's ancestral home and the seat of power within House Ty 'aer, Caer Hen, a small castle located on the outskirts of Valander. Rhydian's father is a respected and noble born political figure within elven society, his mother Rheala, however, was of lower birth, a fact that did not sit well with many of his father's friends and family. Though due to Tegerin's status as lord of the house, no one dared question his choice of marriage to his face. Though Tegerin is a hard man and staunch supporter of traditionalist elven views, Rheala was much more of a free spirit. Few are sure what drew the two together, but many would agree that they drew out the best in one another and Tegerin was certainly more pleasant when in her company.From a young age Rhydian was trained how to fight properly. His mother was a notably skilled marksman and hunter, though she wouldn't talk about it, Rhydian always suspected she had some history in the military. Though in what capacity he had no idea. When Rhydian was nineteen his mother took him and his younger brother Tián, who was only twelve at the time, on a hunt in the Whitewoods. This was to be Tián's first hunt and a quick excursion before the start of the day's major events. The hunt was a success with Rhydian taking down two deer with one arrow each. This would have been one of the proudest moments of Rhydian's life had it not been for the arrival of a band of marauders knows as the Free Wolves who ambushed them on their return to Valander. The Free Wolves caught Rheala, Rhydian, and Tián off-guard and in an attempt to capture Rheala alive as a hostage for ransom a fight ensued. At his mother's command Rhydian attempted to flee with Tián to safety, unfortunately they were perused and cut off. Though Rhydian escaped with his life, Rheala and Tián perished. A memory that haunts Rhydian to this day.Many would say that following Rheala's death any noticeable joy or kindness in Tegerin abruptly vanished. In his grief he placed much of the blame on Rhydian, which created a great rift in their relationship. Tegerin also became much more driven in his work. In the years following, his relationship with his two children Ciara and Rhydian rapidly eroded. One year after the murder of his mother and younger brother, Rhydian decided that it was finally time to leave his life in Valandar behind and see the rest of the world. Ciara decided to leave with him, and much to the disapproval of their father they set off. In doing so Tegerin disowned them both.Rhydian and Ciara traveled North, eventually settling in the major port city of Nevish. For many decades the twins worked together performing odd jobs that required a more subtle approach. One day Ciara accepted a small job offer from a local crime boss by the name of Johan Wiese. The just was simple, pick up the goods from the provider and drop them off for Wiese's men. Unfortunately, something went wrong and Ciara was killed in a scuffle with one of Wiese's lieutenants Lucian de Vond. Since then Rhydian his left behind his dangerous life and taken up a simple life as a performer at a local tavern. Rhydian wears his sister's sword ""Tangwyn"" always as a reminder. "9/18/2017 11:45:06,Zykita Zaroni,Elf,Summoner,"Zykita Zaroni  Cliff NotesI have always been the odd one in the family.  I could hear the voices no one else could.  I could smell the scents that others had no idea lay layered in the air around all.  I could even taste them.  I could feel the power that threads through the ground and is laced through the air.  I could feel the heat from others living, animal and others.As I grew older, such things became more pronounced.  As I grew to maturity I learned not to mention them to anyone else.  My family politely ignored my oddness, and never mentioned it to outsiders, not even in the small village that was nearby.  We all learned mother's lessons.  Strangers are dangerous.  It is dangerous to be strange.  Granted we are all independent individuals anyway, our parents insisted on it.  They had absolutely no intention of raising any of their children to be sheeple.  We raised our animals to be slaughtered at need or whims, they did not raise their children to be.  They taught us to believe what we wanted, what we knew to be true, and to defend each other and those who deserved it, well other than that?  Adults were responsible for themselves, and nature's rule is you will reap what you sow.  As such we were raised to answer the call of family first, then of children and to find the laughter needed in life to live well.  Nature's rules were the ones that had stood the true test of time after all, not man's.Even then we are all explorers.  Our parents taught us well how to live off of the land, and with it as we traveled.  We would trade with towns on the far side of the mountains twice a year.  We left half of the family behind each time to mind the homestead.  We never used the same route twice, come to think of it, we rarely went to the same town twice in a row either.  No sense in spoiling them you see.  We traded the goods we raised, the herbs we harvested in the forests, as well as the hides of the animals we hunted.  All in all my family made a decent living.  We never wanted for anything really, and we all worked to maintain that.  We had fun, as much as we could contrive as well.  They still do.The voices though, well as I said they got stronger every year.  They called me, they tugged at me, and they told me to go.  They wanted me to follow them to the adventures they promised to lead the way to, those adventures were not at the family homestead.  Father understood, he should as they came from his bloodline.  He was an elf you see, and born in the trees of the hidden valleys.  He had followed them in his youth to find his treasure.  Mother had blessed him well with all 9 of us.  I was the only one they called so strongly, therefore he considered me his Heir, and taught me the ways of his people the most.  He came from a long line of Summoners, and I know I will be the next great one.  I am my mother's daughter and I will accept nothing less.  As it is, I have managed to Call my summon at last.  I named him SlakTing and we are ready to find the adventures hidden in the winds at last.  My family has wished me well, and made sure to remind me I am welcome home any time.  My littlest brother has solemnly promised I can share his chores whenever I come back.  It is a good thing too, we all hate to be bored. "9/18/2017 13:07:02,Daefir NewLeaf,Elf,Cleric,"Daefir NewLeaf is a Wood Elf, born of Vaxidor BrightStar and Zylralei FastWater. Daefir's child name was Naelar BrightWater. Daefir took his adult name at the spry young age of 80, when he led his first hunting party. Daefir was raised in the Wise Woods, and was brought up learning the ways of the healer, helping his mother Zylralei heal any wounded members of the clan. As well as learning to heal others, Daefir learned the ways of nature, and how important nature is to all life on the planet. 8 years after taking his adult name, Daefir was on a hunting mission by himself, wandering the Wise Woods tracking what seemed to be a herd of some beasts. Daefir followed the tracks to find a sight that horrified him: a clearing had been chopped into the woods, the mangled corpses of the trees tossed aside carelessly and unceremoniously. Scared and distraught, Daefir searched the clearing for any sign of what could have done this to his woods. Amongst some broken branches and some ashes, he found a small knife. Though it was nothing special, there was something off about this knife. Daefir was used to the elegant blades of the elves, but this knife was exactly the opposite: rough, blunt, and cruel - looking. He recalled a story his father had once told him that included blades very similar to the style of this blade. After some thought and pondering, he realized what he had found: the knife of an orc. Panicked, Daefir searched the clearing and quickly found the trail the orcs left as they deserted their camp. They were headed east, straight for the home of Daefir's clan. Daefir ran as fast as he could, tracking the scar the orcs had left across the forest, trying to catch up to them or beat them to his home. He had to warn his family, his friends, and his clan. Daefir ran for 25 miles, as fast as he could back to his home. Upon arrival, all that remained of his clans home were the signs of a battle: Bodies strewn across the forest floor; a few low burning flames; the stench of blood; and lastly, two lone, young lootahs. A rage swept over Daefir as he nocked an arrow and sent it through the heart of the first orc. Before the dead orc had even hit the ground Daefir was charging into the second orc with his blade drawn. A short fight burst out, the orc and the elf attacking with merciless fury. After a few seconds, the orc joined his friend upon the forest floor, dead. Daefir searched his clans home and found his parents, his friends, and every single one of his clan members dead, slain by the orc tribes cruel blades and maces. The elf wept, for a day and a night. Once he could weep no more, Daefir gathered the bodies of his clansmen, gave them an elvish funeral, buried the bodies in 8 large graves, one grave for every family of the clan, and returned them to nature. He then went to the orc bodies left strewn about, and cast them into the forest. From each orc body left behind by their brethren, Daefir took a single tooth. He strung these teeth together to keep as a necklace, and as a reminder of what the orcs have done to his family and to him. Daefir, covered in blood, dirt, sweat and tears, went to a nearby stream to clean himself. At the stream, he met a wizard. The human went by the name of (Daniel's Character), and he was kind to Daefir. The elf and the human became fast friends, and together they left the place that had been forever tainted for Daefir. They traveled north to the city of (whatever the city called lol) in search of knowledge and to bring forth what Daefir had learned: orcs are cruel and evil beings that must not be trusted. "9/18/2017 10:15:25,X'enthaladae Von Rylann,Elf,Wizard,"X’enthaladae was born to Baelleron and Meridiath Von Rylann, the patriarch and matriarch of the wealthy Von Rylann noble family.The Von Rylann’s were merchant nobles, purchasing the family title over six-hundred years ago with the vast wealth they had accumulated through their ruthless trading empire. The empire was built over a period of 350 years by Thrennilsif, X’enthaladae’s great-grandmother, before grooming her eldest son, Heraltheon to take over and expand the empire. Heraltheon turned out to be as ruthless as his mother and garnered several monopolies on commodities as well as exclusive rights to many of the most profitable trading routes. Heraltheon built on his mother’s efforts, expanding the family’s wealth to be able to purchase their noble title, hoping to solidify the position of the family among the aristocracy and allow their business to profit from noble law. It was at the height of the Von Rylann merchant empire when Heraltheon passed the mantle of house Patriarch to Baelleron. Baellerion was one of six siblings, and the second son of Heraltheon. The eldest son, Galistriaan, was passed over for Patriarch because Heraltheon thought him weak. Baelleron did not share his father’s view of his eldest brother seeing in him a very keen mind for business. In an attempt to mend the rift between Baelleron and his five siblings placed each as head of different trade routes for the vast empire, with Galistriaan appointed to the most profitable of all routes. This kindness was ultimately Baelleron’s undoing.With Baelleron relying on each of his siblings to manage their own part of the empire, he no longer had direct information about the day-to-day business. This hands-off approach allowed Galistriaan to manipulate his siblings over the years, consolidate the business holdings and was able to establish a rival company that now held all of the Von Rylann previously owned assets which Galistriaan now held sole ownership of. This left Baelleron and Meredith along with their three children bankrupt.X’enthaladae was blissfully unaware of any of the machinations by his uncle. Having two older siblings, a brother Mordellath and sister Daesthena, the Von Rylann family had it’s heirs. Both of X’enthaladae’s siblings were being groomed for the family business, and more power to them. Business was not something X’enthaladae thought interesting in the least. And being the youngest of three children, X’enthaladae was left to pursue his life of idleness and wonton spending of the family’s fortune. He would pursue one pastime or another, wherever his fancy would lead, which often lead him to women and drink. But, he eventually discovered a talent for the Arcane and was a very good student when he could be bothered to try.The morning that his family was officially bankrupt started out quite normally for X’enthaladae, that is to say hung-over and in the company of a young lady whose name he couldn’t recall. He didn’t believe it when his sister told him, he didn’t believe it when his brother told him, he didn’t even believe it when his mother and father told him. It wasn’t until he was forcefully removed by several heavily armed and armored men that it started sinking in that they might not have anymore money.With no skills and no money X’enthaladae was left to fend for himself. While his family was willing to put up with his antics when their resources were near infinite, with nothing but their purchased title to their names, he was quickly turned out to make his own way in the world. Each of his family members had a lifetime of dedication and skills which they quickly sought to leverage toward gaining back their wealth, each as their personal skills dictated. His Mother and Father, scraped together some funds to purchase a cargo vessel and put their sea fairing skills to use following in Baelleron’s grandmother’s footsteps. His Brother had married into another Noble family before the fall, and was forced to leverage his wife’s fortune toward rebuilding his own. His sister had much of Uncle Galistriaan’s abilities and after the fall took advantage of all the less than reputable business contacts she had made over the years to apply her skills within the ranks of the underworld. Which left X’enthaladae alone in a world that doesn’t care if you are a noble if you do not have money. For months he spent time staying with any of his friends that would have him, but there too he soon wore out his welcome. With no one left to sponge off of, X’enthaladae was forced to do the worst thing he could imagine. Get a job.That is how X’enthaladae found himself walking down this road after successfully escorting a caravan to Keskit…"9/18/2017 11:56:29,Whirlwind Striker,Elf,Monk,"JOURNAL ENTRIES(WHIRLWIND STRIKER)This is a journal of my thoughts so I can define my path before me.  The monks that raised me suggested that I do this.  I personally don’t know how much it will benefit me, but it certainly can’t hurt.  I guess I should start at the first memories I have.  I remember mass confusion, fire, fighting and destruction.  There were men on horseback that were killing everyone.  I’ll never forget the sight of one of them riding up behind my mother and hauling her up and over his saddle.  He knocked her in the head with his sword to quiet her screams and struggles.  I was hiding in the old basement of the village church where my mother had stashed me for safety with the instructions ”Don’t come out no matter what happens.  They must not find you or find out about you for the safety of all of us.  Promise me you will stay hidden until one comes that your heart tells you you can trust.  Until then you must stay alive and hidden, there is food stashed here for you for a week.”  I stayed where I was and watched the rest of my village die.  They lit the church on fire when they burned the rest of the village to the ground.  The church was made of stone so only the wooden pews burned.  I watched and I prayed.  Prayed to every god that would listen,  for understanding and knowledge and most of all for justice for all of the villagers cut down w/o a chance.   They fed the fires for 2 days, even then I recognized the mark and stench of magical fire.  The only one I saw them carry away was my mother,  they may have taken others as slaves or sacrifices, I’m not sure.  The feeling of evil radiated off of them like rays from the sun.  They raked threw the ashes to make sure everything was burned.  They were not interested in plunder at all, only utter destruction.  When they left the fires were but smoke and rubble.  There was a pall of despair in their wake.  It seemed like the sun had to filter thru a cover of ugliness even at high noon.  Carrion eaters wouldn’t even descend, not that there was anything left for them.  Still I prayed.  I could do nothing else.  I guess I received an answer as I knew that if I betrayed my presence to them it would all have been in vain.  So I waited and watched.  2 days after the village was burned a small party of clerics that had dark robes came by.  They appeared to be looking for something.  I sincerely hoped they wouldn’t find me.  While they were there it seemed as if the cloud thickened and grew more evil.  They searched all day and night.  As dawn approached they finally passed on.   3 days after the clerics left I felt a change.  I could actually feel the sun again, and see the gloom lifting.  A man walked to where I was hiding and he seemed to know I was there.  He just stood nearby and said. ”There will come a day when you know that you must trust your heart as your mother told you, is today that day?”  Then he stood there and waited, I somehow knew he could wait forever w/o any problems.  I listened to my heart that day when I came out of my hiding place and began to follow the monk.We traveled far.  We stopped at several different monasteries, but only to pray and rest.  In between he taught me the ways and thoughts of a monk.  He taught me to always find balance within myself as well as the world we passed thru.  Finally we came to a small monastery that I never would have even seen with out his help.  It was literally part of a mountain and the monastery was within the mountain itself.  It reminded me of a dwarven city that I had heard my mother telling stories about.  The monk just walked up to a tree, knocked on it and said,  ” We of the Brotherhood have passed our test and request entrance the Monastery of Learning.”  Then another voice said ”What tests have you passed that has earned your entrance to this holy place?”  ”We have traveled far and followed the way of our hearts within thru fire, darkness, despair and temptation to come together to this place.” said my friend.  ”If what you say is true, you will find your own entrance and pass thru w/o harm, if you fail you will never remember this place as only the ones who truly follow the inner path may pass the barrier intact,”  the bodiless voice returned.  My friend nodded, took my hand and we walked thru the solid mountain.    "9/18/2017 13:11:38,Raloren,Elf,Ranger,"Born in Aeranel, Raloren was always a trouble maker in his youth, picking fights with other children and showing disrespect to his elders and the undying court’s rules. He often ran to the solitude of the forests exploring the trees and hunting and studying the wildlife, while training with a long bow he stole from the guards, far too large for him. He was however, not a very good student and had no real friends, he preferred the solitude that the forest and mountains afforded him.When news of the Last War reached Aerenal, human’s searching for any warriors to fight for their kings. Raloren being only in his 20’s was considered not old enough to fight. However, he snuck on to one of the Brelish boats if at least to get away from Aeranel. A mercenary by the name Erlan found him stowed away in the cargo hold hungry and regretful of his decision. Instead of exposing Raloren to the ship’s captain, he brought him food and took him under his wing. After arriving in Breland, Erlan brought Raloren to his mercenary company and ask them to accept him into their ranks having seen potential in him. Erlan taught Raloren the way of the sword. Raloren proved a quick study but still preferring the bow to the sword.After 20 years of training with Erlan, Raloren was finally ready to fight and so he did. For the next 70+ years Raloren worked his way up the ranks of his mercenary company, as well as bringing up the station of his company within the Brelish army. He fought many battles and worked with many interesting characters, notably a changeling spy named Tazzak, whose odd demeanor made Raloren question whether he could trust him, but ultimately his raw killing ability made Raloren admire Tazzaks efficiency. As well as bonding with a war horse he named Charger whom he nursed back to health using the knowledge he gained back in the forests of Aeranel. He was a prodigal fighter finding very little match for his prowess with both blade and bow for nearly 70 years. Until one battle, defending the Lurching tower near the Cyre, Breland, and Thrane joint border. During the battle, Raloren saw an enormous man, riding an enormous horse, and shot him off his horse with the same bow that he stole from the guards so long ago. The man was much quicker than Raloren could expect from a man that imposing. He was quickly upon Raloren and slashed apart that bow he has been training with for his entire life, the only thing he had left from Aeranel. With no time to mourn for his prized possession, Raloren pulled out his blades and tried his best to fight back against the man he figured based on the crest on his armor and stories from the front was probably the Hell Hound of the famed Devil Dogs. Raloren moved quick to avoid the Hell Hounds sweeping strikes and parrying when he could. Baited into an opening, Raloren lunged at his opponent who grabbed and shattered his blade at the handle, then kicked to the ground. Without breath and desperate to survive, another Brelish soldier Raloren did not know distracted the Hell Hound with a slash to his back, to which he responded by cutting the man in two. Raloren horrified by what he just saw, attacked at the opening and cut the Hell Hound up the left side of his face. In that moment, the hulking man swung the flat side of his blade right into Raloren’s breaking it, the two stared at one another with hatred and respect for a moment before Erlan had called for Raloren to retreat, the cyre soldiers had flanked their forces and the battle was lost.After the war, Raloren was unsure whether to return to Aeranel, a place which he never considered a home, or staying in Breland to continue on as a mercenary. Instead, Raloren and Erlan became part of the fledgling nation of Valenar creating of one of the lesser war-clans, the wolf clan, with other members of their mercenary group. Amongst a raid from a war-clan of a much higher status trying to absorb his own Raloren was rushed into the battle killing his fair share of combatants. He noticed Erlan fighting a Dalan Rael, a holy warrior committed to dying like his ancestors. Erlan, who also became a Dalan Rael, submitted to his righteous death at the hands of a greater warrior. Raloren fataly shot the Dalan Rael right before the invader could kill his mentor. After the battle the tribe leader, his old mercenary general whom Raloren shared no love for, Commander Elladar, consulted with the Keeper of the Past to determine what his punishment for dishonoring the ancestors, by saving Erlan from righteous death. Erlan joined the discussions and upon finding that they were planning on punishing Raloren by death, offered the keepers his life in service in exchange for Raloren being exiled. The keepers agreed, but Elladar, seeing both Erlan and Raloren as threats to his leadership, executed Erlan when they returned to the village. Raloren was exiled from all lands of Valenar, Charger was too old to come with him so he was left behind. Raloren was allowed to leave unharmed under the condition that he never returns or he will face death. However, Raloren has dedicated the past 3 years to training so that he can kill his commander Elladar thus allowing him to return as leader of his war tribe. Raloren, for the third time in his life felt like he had no home, returned to Breland. Unable to find anywhere he felt he belonged, Raloren returned to the forests. He lived his days out hunting and subsisting in the King’s Forest. Finding a new companion in the form of a dire wolf pup he named Flip, because every time he approached him the wolf would flip over to have its belly rubbed. He lived in the forest just him and Flip for nearly a year until his path crossed a Hound Archon named Bolt, who saw his skill and invited him to join his crew as a protector of his sailors."9/18/2017 7:08:03,Mahon Hithaerdir,Elf,Ranger,"Rinn Hithaerdir was born into a life of privilege, twenty years after his sister Aoibheann. His father, Loegaire, was a wealthy merchant, his mother Silvren the ranger daughter of a Lord. They lived in a large house on a hill, overlooking the city of Oestramoor in the country of Tamaris. There was plenty of space for he and his sister to run free and play, and they often spent their time in the surrounding Marrowood, running through the black and silver trees.But around the time he was fifty, his sister began to show signs of arcane ability. Strong, frightening ability. She would practice in solitude, often hiding from her younger brother, although he was fascinated by her skill. He was too young to understand that their father would see this as a problem.When she came of age and chose the name Aoibheann, she approached their father asking to enter the arcane school of the Spire. Rinn was not there to witness the fight, but it escalated quickly, her father refusing to let her go for fear it would draw negative attention to their family, as magical abilities were frowned upon in Tamaris. Aoibheann's abilities were too dangerous, he insisted, and she countered that she needed to attend in order to learn to control it. When he told her no such thing would happen, she unleashed a spell by accident in her fury, nearly hitting her father. Enraged, he cast her out.Horrified by the events, Rinn took off into the night after his sister, subsequently getting lost and separated from his parents. He wandered alone for some time, and when autumn rolled in he happened upon a band of gnomish vagabonds in the woods, singing and drinking around a campfire. Hungry, he approached them, and to his surprise they sat him right down and fed him. He ended up staying on.The gnomes were a group of tricksters who made their silver by swindling people in small towns, staying just long enough to finish their 'job' before leaving quickly the next morning before anyone was any bit the wiser. Although dishonest, they were not cruel, and they taught him the value of mirth and a cheerful disposition. He learned many tricks himself, things that would help him along his path later on. He also learned the thieves' cant from them, a language spoken in front of those they were targeting, that only they could understand. The young elf became invaluable to them. He was just as charming and cunning as they were, and soon he was helping them pull off larger swindles than they could have managed on their own. It was here he gained his facial piercings, as the same adorned many of the gnomes.He was invaluable until they needed money.One evening when he was 115, the elf boy was lead away after dinner with the gnomes by the elder, through the woods until they came upon a road. Down a short way, there was a caravan of brightly coloured wagons, on the side of which read ""Green Port Circus."" As they drew nearer, he heard the roars and growls of animals, kept chained behind the wagons. A lion, a bear, a direwolf. He would later learn they were part of the act.A human in a red and blue striped coat approached them, and handed the gnome a small purse of gold. ""Sorry, boy,"" the gnome told him, ""it's only business.""Before he could realize what was happening, he was being herded into a wagon.When his eyes adjusted to the light, he saw himself among six others: a dwarf, two female human twins, a gnome with gems encrusted in his teeth, and another elf, who sat clutching a small baby wrapped in a swaddle.At first he begrudged the gnomes for giving him over to the circus troupe, but having nowhere else to go, he stayed on, becoming skilled in acrobatics. He performed all sorts of feats on the high wire, the trapeeze. And over time, he became friends with the troupe themselves.There was the dwarf, called Hamhock, who had amazing strength. The human twins, who did beautiful dance routines, Myra and Lyra. The gnome, Raspip, who did wonderful magic tricks. And then there was the animal tamer, a beautiful high elf with indigo blue tattoos named Caoimhe. Perhaps it was their shared history, but they became fast friends, Caoimhe eventually teaching him to care for the Bear, which lead to his nickname of Mahon, given affectionately by his friend.Caoimhe's son was a half-drow named Oisin, and his birth was something Caoimhe only called ""a short and unpleasant story."" He had the pale skin of his mother, but rather than share her blonde hair, his was a shocking white, and his eyes red. Though many would view him as abhorrent in the elven community, Mahon said he was only a baby.Mahon and Caoimhe spent most of their time together, developing a dual act involving the lion and the bear. Mahon became so attached to the bear that one evening Caoimhe jokingly offered him a tattoo of a bear. To her surprise, Mahon agreed, and she teased him by saying she would put it on his face. He only shrugged, and so they spent hours in the firelight as she carefully pricked his cheek again and again, until a dark blue bear bloomed there on his face. He couldn't mind, seeing as she was the one who gave him the name he decided to keep, Mahon, ""bear.""Life in the circus was so grand that Mahon let the thoughts of his family, and his original quest to find his sister, slip entirely. The only problem was the ringleader, Sebastian, who had originally purchased Mahon's services. He was prone to drink, and would become mean. And then one night he threatened Caoimhe's young son, calling him an ""abomination."" He was repentant in the morning, but to the dismay of all, Caoimhe and her son had fled in the night, leaving not even a note for Mahon.Mahon, realizing he had been in love, was heartbroken. In retribution, he left the following evening, after freeing all the animals in the night. The bear, confused, had tried to follow him. Despite Mahon's attempt to shoo it, Bear came with him, and the two wandered the countryside searching for Caoimhe and Oisin.Eventually they came to Vas Nuar, and he gave up on his search, settling in a house outside the city and spending his time honing his craft. Although many bad things had happened in his short life, Mahon, now 270, seemed content to carry on exactly as he was. He was happy, busy, he figured he had everything he wanted. He had learned long ago to not dwell on the past and what he no longer had.He is no longer searching for Aoibheann or Caoimhe, and has no idea what happened to his family, but you would never know it from his happy-go-lucky demeanor. He's just not one to pine."9/18/2017 11:54:57,Thorika Bowmaker,Elf,Ranger,"JOURNAL ENTRIES(Thorika Bowmaker)I am writing this now to help straighten out what I know and am learning into a logical fashion.  My story  is one of  bizarre coincidences to be sure.  First off my family’s legacy of a magical bow is mine without any instructions.  I know my elven relatives are quite affronted by my  mother’s temerity in naming me as the bearer of the bow.  I know that it has a long and involved history, even if I don’t know what that is.   It is a family heirloom.  The one obvious thing that it does is magically create it’s own arrows.  I know it glows sometimes but I haven’t decided if it glows around danger or evil, to me or it.  My teacher I think knows more but chooses not to tell me for promises to my parents who were great friends of hers.  I know that she decided to take me on out of friendship for them and I think, regret that she was not there to help when they needed it most.  My parents were well known as hero’s and adventurers even while they were shunned for being together and even more after I was born.  They didn’t care what their families and friends thought, they belonged together and that was that.  The 2 of them together were a sight to see, you could easily visualize their connection.  When father died at the hands of some undead minions under the control of the necro Agravated Death, mother knew right away.   He had been guiding a group into a new settlement area that was supposedly safe.  The only reason mother wasn't with him was because she was working closely with a wizard friend on a secret spell against the undead.  Later, after she finished the research she went after his killers.   Although she took down the undead that killed him the necro-mage got away, she fell into depression and faded away.  There was nothing I could do to help.  I had to watch her slowly die.  I found out later that the research she completed after father died she paid for literally with her soul.  Once her quest for vengeance was over, she had to pay the price.  That is why I know that the undead killed both my parents.  I have hated and hunted them since.  I still don't know exactly what the spell was that she sold her soul for, she  just said that the success would help me and my children against the undead.  Then she named me as the next bearer of the Family Bow of Red Forest.  Only one member from her family attended her funeral and the only reason he came was to pick up the Bow.  He was furious when he found out that she had passed it on to me in front of witnesses even he couldn't discredit.  He never said a word to me just insisted that upon my death the family had the right to the Bow.  I will pass it on to someone who is worthy, for I know that is what she would have wanted.  I will never forget the day that I first drew the Bow.  It felt as if I'd used it forever.  I know there is more to the Bow to discover.   I roam the forests now hunting the undead and protecting the forest.  About 2 weeks ago I came across some poachers who had discovered the nesting area of a pair of hippogriffs.  Unfortunately the only one that survived was the foal that the poachers were trying to steal.  I made sure those particular humans would never poach in my forest again.  The poor foal was tied up and blindfolded, he couldn't walk, see or even stand up.  He was starved and in shock.  Even in the horrible shape he was in I could tell he would be a handsome beast indeed.  His coloration was very rare.  He has a grey dappled hide, darker a little bit towards his hindquarters and on his wings.  It reminds me of moonlight reflecting off the lake on a cloudless night.  He just now is strong enough to walk on his own.  I haven't been able to find another flight that will accept him.  He is growing almost daily now and his appetite never stops.  He is a good friend to talk to here in the woods.  I call him Airienalle and he responds to it now.  One day he will fly again, although up to now he has shown no desire to try.  He seems content to follow me around.  If I leave for more than a few minutes he tends to panic.  I have managed to work my way into safer territory so I don't have to spend as much time away from him scouting for danger.  There is a small hut that I found abandoned some time ago.  It sits close to a little meadow.  We can stay there as long as it takes to let Airienalle grow and heal.  I am almost looking forward to a short break from hunting the undead.  Today, when I was on my way back to the hut I heard a furious scream of rage from Airienalle and sprinted the last mile back to the hut.  When I got there I saw Airienalle in a loosing battle with a griffon who had obviously decided the yearling was just the right size for a snack.  I quickly drew my bow and helped dispatch the griffon.  The amazing thing was that Arienalle had finally figured out how to fly in his desperate run/battle with the griffon.  I checked him over thoroughly and he seemed far more pleased with himself than hurt.  After I patched him up he decided to try his new flying out.  The acrobatics he performed were amazing and glorious to watch.  At least they  were after a few close calls.  I think I can start making plans to go back to work now.  I hope Airienalle chooses to accompany me.  I will pass the word to the traders I know for a proper saddle to ride him when he turns 2.  Another ranger stopped by and delivered some information about some undead armies massing in another forest.  From the description of the leader it is Agravated Death.  They have put out a call for help to all elves who can help in any way.  The community is a small one and an easy target for treachery.  Because of its location, without alot of help, it stands an almost futile defense.  We all know that despite this we cannot let the monsters a foothold into our world.  It is a good distance from here but I cannot ignore the call for help against my ancient enemy.  They can certainly use my skills and knowledge  for facing my foe.   It will be the first major journey that Airienalle and I have taken together.  Until now we have pretty much just patrolled our own Forest and the area around it.  Airienalle is 2 now and assures me that he is up to it.  He has become the best friend I have.  I have to stop by the village and let them know I will be gone for an unknown time so they can make arrangements for another Ranger to cover my territory.  It was like closing a chapter of my life.  I don't think it will be the same when I get back, no matter what happens.  The council gave me a list of magical items to look for and bring back from my travels so they can duplicate them in the future.   "9/18/2017 11:58:09,Wunjoria Oakstride,Elf,Druid,"JOURNAL ENTRIES( WUNJORIA OAKSTRIDE )My father was a bitter, unhappy man.  At least I know that now.  Then, he was an angry, abusive, sorry excuse for a living person.  He didn’t play favorites, he just hated us all.  10 kids and a wife who caused all his woes in numerous ways, as far as he was concerned.  My mother would put up with it for awhile and then she’d blow up too.  She wasn’t as quite as nasty as he was, but it was close.  I’m amazed they got together enough to have 10 kids.  Life was a constant battle for survival as truce was never called.  On their last fight one of them broke a lantern and they were to determined to win the fight to leave the burning house.  They died the way they lived.  In full battle with no honour.  All of us kids were farmed out to whoever would take us.  I don’t  even know there names as we were all referred to as ”Dung-Eater ” or ”Bitch Mistress” or other things far less complimentary.  I don’t know about the others, but the farm I was placed in wasn’t much of an improvement.  I did discover one thing on the farm.  Animals are cool.  They are honest beyond what a human is capable of.  They became my friends.  They learned all my hopes, dreams and wishes.  They heard of the adventures waiting for me, andd the ones that my imagination came up with.  They listened and helped me plot against the evil ones of the realms.  I freed slaves and purged haunted places.  At least I did when I was with the animals.  When I was around my foster parents it was a completely different thing.  They had only taken me on because their son died the previous winter.   They made it very clear I was a poor substitute for their precious son.   Every time they saw me I was made aware of more of my inadequacies, usually while they were trying to toughen me up.  I personnally believe their son is better off in the afterlife than he was in that household.  It was probably a relief to be free of them.  I worked hard in the mistaken belief that I would eventually prove to be of worth.  I learned to plow, plant and harvest.  I spent the winters in the barn for I never ""earned"" a place in the house, warmed by the fire.    I rarely saw another elf as my foster parents were not exactly popular.  Travelers never stopped by to pass the news of the kingdom.  I learned that I could do some healing on animals and myself, it is the only way I survived.  That ability manifested itself after puberty and a severe beating for stealing a radish to feed an animal they no longer had a use for and so had returned to the wild to fend for it's self.   I knew if they found out about it they would use it against me and for their benefit only.  So, after 3 years and many bruises, broken bones and other various injuries later, I ran away from that household.I made my way as far from there as I could.  Driven, unable to stop, I traveled for 2 seasons at least.  I worked at inns in the stables to earn my keep.  I also would stop and help out farms and such as I continued on my travels.  I didn't know where I was going but I knew it wasn't where I was.  So, I would travel on after a short time.  The summer passed and it became harder and harder to earn my way.  The nights became colder, and longer.  I would comfort myself with the memories of my time with the animals at the farm and those I had dealt with on my travels.  I would dream of finding a place of peace, then I'd wake up to the reality of never having known it.  At last I found peace in a small grove.  Tired, hungry and hurting, my last thought was ”It’s better to die at peace, then die in a useless, honourless battle as my parents did.”  This was my thought as I fell asleep in the falling snow that night.I woke up in a small, spare room.  The feeling of peace hadn’t left me.  I thought that there was a mistake and I had made it to the summerlands.  Here I didn’t even hurt anymore.  Then the door opened and a man walked in.  He wasn’t classically handsome, but there was such an aura of peace, and power around him, I immediately felt safe in a way I never known.  He invited me to help with dinner and we talked about animals and nature.  As the seasons passed I continued to follow him and he to teach me.  I learned of nature in all her moods and faces.  I learned to heal the hurts of others as he had healed me.  I never spoke of my past and he never asked.  I know he knew of it, but it was important only in that it brought me here.  I learned to talk to the animals in the grove and revere them for what they are.  I know there was a village nearby but I never went there.  Several of the villagers were healed by me when they came for healing.  Then I started wandering and I would stop by the sick or elderly and help them.  I never went to town, just the outskirts and outlaying farms.  As my wandering took me further, so too did rumors spread.  As time passed and rumors spread, I noticed that I liked being out and about.  Traveler's I had never met recognized me when I stopped to help them.  They told me news of far away places.  Fascinating things were happening, and even more were being learned.  That is what I valued most from our conversations, the knowledge that they passed on to me without even noticing.  No one had an unkind word to say to me.  I gradually stopped expecting to get embroiled in a fight every time I came across someone.  So I spent more time out and about and less time at the grove.  I was learning more and more on my own.  I was developing my own interests and hobbies, and though I didn't know why, I was feeling restless.  Then one day when I returned I found Wreathe waiting for me.  He had a bundle with him and an old quarterstaff that I had seen in his sacred grove for years.  I asked him if he was leaving and he just laughed and said no.  ""This is for you and your journey.  I started working on it shortly after you came to me as I knew this day would come.  It was made for you and is attuned to you alone.  To everyone else it will only be a normal quarterstaff, to you it will save your skin. You are healed and it is time for you to go.  The eaglet fledged must fly on her own or she will die.  Speaking of which,"" he nodded his head toward Cyclone sitting on a nearby branch, ""You are not the only one who is healed and ready to start her journey.  As you saved her from the cyclone that both gave her her name and destroyed her family.   A bond has formed between you that will last the rest of your lives.   She’s as impatient to fly in new skies as you are to see new places.  You have a visitor to see before you leave as well.""  We walked out towards the village road together, I realized I had never taken it before.  I’d seen others use it, but I never had.  There was a committe waiting for us.  It wasn’t the entire village, just some of the people I had helped over the seasons, still there were quite a few of them.  One who I recognized from healing his wife from a difficult birth.  I found out then that he had been elected Mayor.  ”Wreath told us you’d be leaving today.  It didn’t seem right to let you go without some sort of thank you from all of us.  This was left at the inn by someone who got in a fight and ended up meeting his maker.  It was confiscated by the inn keeper for the room fee.  There is 200 and some gold,  38 platinum and 24 gems.  There is also a complete set of plate armor and weapons which we know you can’t use but you can trade them for whatever you need when you get further into civilization.   This here is a bag of holding and it’s a big one so it should hold anything you need it to. There is also 2 mos worth of trail rations supplied by the village baker.  The rest of the kit is the fighter’s traveling gear.  You’re the only one gonna be traveling from these parts for a while so make good use of them.   Last but not least is this here scroll.  It was made up by the bookkeeper so you can be proud to have it. ”  He opened it up and I saw that it was a note saying thank you for all your help, and it was covered in signatures.   ”Everyone you ever helped in these parts made sure to sign it so you’d know how much your help really meant.”   So it was I took to the road once again in a totally new way.   "9/18/2017 9:01:20,Velethuil'adar Shalandaerl,Elf,Wizard,"Velethuil’adar Shalandaerl was born among elven royalty in the city of Val’Andaerl, the middle son of Prince Althair Shalandaerl. Velth took easily to being overlooked among his family. He viewed nearly all of his time at court as a vast waste of his life and unceasingly boring. Veleth often snuck away from his lessons to spend time in the Library and Arcanery of the palace. It was here that he developed a love of knowledge and all things arcane. The curator of the place was an elderly wizard by the name of Tor’Lial. The two would spend hours together and developed a close bond and Tor’Lial taught him of legends and magics and spells long forgotten.  Pretty much free to do as he pleased his time at the library went on with the consent of his family.  He excelled in his studies and eventually gained employment within the library, being mastered for Tor’Lial for eventual curatorship of the Palace collection.On Veleth’s 75th nameday Tor’Lial was found dead in his sleep, having succumbed to his old age.  Veleth was devastated and retreated into the Arcanum, brooding among the collection for years. The loss of his friend and mentor having made him dismissive of his family and the outer world he retreated into his position as Master of the Arcanum and made every attempt to learn its entire knowledge.One winter's evening years later an Emissary of the Greenbriar Collective came to call upon the palace. This agent was on a mission and needed access to the Arcanum and its resources.  The Shalandaerl family being major supporters of the Collective as well as donors were happy to oblige. Alluriel Tarondaelon was a master wizard among the Collective, special professor at large of Evocation and a distant relative of the Shalandaerl family.  A prodigy in her own right she quickly became impressed with Veleth’s knowledge of the Arcanums more obscure references and his ability to come to conclusions on her research before she could herself. From Veleth’s point of view she was unlike anything he had ever encountered. Elegant, beautiful and with a mind as razor sharp and as formidable as his. No one since Tor’Lial had been able to keep up with him, let alone keep his interest as long as she could.  It was with mutual respect that Alluriel approached the Shalandaerl family about his accompanying her on the mission and possible admittance into the Collective.  Supportive of their son and pleased with his sudden interest with the outside world again he was granted permission and set out on his first adventure. Thus at the age of 85 Veleth left Val'Andaerl and would not return again for 200 years, when the city fell into shadow from a Drow plot.Veleths first mission involved an Oni and disappearing noble children from the city of Green Water.  It was here that they met with Saewon Vanloth an Elven Paladin of Tyr.  It seemed that the creature was stealing noble children from the highest of families during the night and running off to an unknown location.  Saewon had been called to the area by his god, having sensed an evil presence behind the Oni. TOgether the group eventually tracked the Oni down to a cabin deep in the Verdant Expanse, a thick dangerous forest connected with the Feywild.  Here they confronted the Oni and destroyed him, in the process they revealed that it had been infact working for a wild magic sorcerer who escaped with a child deep into the wood. As they pursued the sorcerer they cornered him near a portal to the Feywild. Veleth still new to the use of arcane magics in practical application lashed out with a scroll he had found during the investigation of the cabin. THe use of the scroll nearly killed him and its backlash caused the portal to rupture, wiping the sorceror of his mind and unknown to the group  on the other side of the portal a Hag awaited with her coven for the child prophesized to bring her to great power. With the portal unstable it killed most of her coven and nearly her as well as it collapsed. With the child saved and Veleth revived by Saewon the group headed back into town, but not before Tyr gave a warning to Velth through Saewon.“Beware the Nights Mistress for shadows gather and the light of the emerald star will fall to darkness.”Not knowing what it meant but promising his sword should he need it Saewon and Velth parted ways but would have many missions together until Saewon’s death at the Shattered Spire in Dragonmount near Razorwind.Veleth's strength of character and will and exemplary investigation skills earned him entrance into the Collective and he was granted membership by Alluriel herself.  For another 100 years he studied and apprenticed with various leaders of Arcane and Investigative arts and was Alluriels right hand on missions.During one mission to the Feywild, Alluriel and Veleth were sent to give aid to Queen Titania. It seemed that there was a mysterious contingent threatening the area. members of the Queen's court had been going missing and they were called upon to investigate, The Collective having owed a Favor from the Seelie Court. Upon investigation they discovered Fomorian involvement. Fomorians having their roots in the Feydark hadn't been seen in centuries.  Once again as they solved the incursion and with the help of the queens warriors, they disrupted the plans of the Hag who was using the Fey blood to spawn a portal to the Abyss. The ensuing battle sent her down her own portal and at the mercy of its denizens. It was after this mission that Veleth professed his love to Alluriel and found it reciprocated in her as well. At the end of the 3 week mission Veleth and Alluriel were joined by Queen Titania herself.Velth and Alluriel lived a productive life within the collective for the next several decades. Each rose higher in the ranks and at 285 Veleth was granted full Professorship and Tenure.  Shortly after this the collective was called to investigate strange rumors emanating from Val’Andearl. Velth and his pregnant wife rushed to the land of their family to assist the Collective in their investigation.  While there they uncovered a Drow plot as Veleth’s own brother had been under the influence of master enchanter from the Drow and had been feeding information and artifacts from the Arcanum to the Underdark fro years.  For 2 years a battle raged and during that war with the Drow Veleth and Alluriel’s daughter Tiri’len Calemmir was born.  At the end of the war with the Drow it was revealed that they were being used by a demon from the Abyss and the artifacts and information gained from Veleth’s brother were being funneled to this Demon for an unknown purpose.  Once again the Hag was behind the plot but this time she was successful in obtaining a relic vital to her and the Demons plan, she also learned of Veleths daughter and vowed revenge. 75 years passed with the Professor and his family living in peace and prosperity. He became a popular academic and agent of the Collective and a valuable resource for the surrounding continent as well as a formidable wizard in his own right.In his 360th year he and Alluriel accompanied an adventuring group on their investigation of a Hag coven who had ransacked an ancient temple.  During the course of the investigation it was revealed to be a trap. Veleth was struck down and almost died as the Hag came face to face with her nemesis.  Alluriel fought her with all her might but was in the end also struck down and near death. The Hag then threatened Alluriel with the life of her daughter and offered a compromise.  WIthin the Greenbriar collective was a collection of artifacts she needed, one of them strongly tied to the blood of the Shalandaerl Family.  In exchange for Alluriel’s power and these artifacts the Hag would spare the lives of her family and allow them to live. Taking the deal the Hag used a dark and deadly spell on both the Professor and Alluriel, wiping their minds of the incident. As the Hag escaped she slayed the adventuring party.  When they awoke they were amidst the ruins of the temple and the remains of the party with no knowledge of what had happened.  THe Collective could not deduce the cause or purpose of the covens attack or the loss of Alluriels power and the case went cold.  One year later the Greenbriar Collective was attacked and valuable artifacts stolen. That same day Veleths daughter disappeared, as the Hag enacted her plot and needed the blood of a Shalandaerl in her plans.  For 15 years the Professor searched with the Collectives backing but nothing came to fruition and the case was closed by the Council.  Alluriel and Veleth fell out as she left on her own investigation never to return. The Professor closed himself off to the world again like that day so many centuries before when he lost all that was dear to him. He retreated into his studies and lectures and became absent minded in his heartbreak.  On his 435th year the Collective called upon the Professor once again, pairing him with a young upstart Samson in hopes of breaking Veleths self imposed exile.  They were sent to Harrowmire where he and Samson attempted to stop a Lich that had taken the town hostage.  Through the course of the investigation they met a strange and powerful sorcerer named the Woodsman and with his guidance gained access to Harrowmire.  In the Process of gaining access The Professor was haunted by visages of his daughter by a Nightmare and granted a wish by a spirit of his lost daughter.  Eventually they faced and defeated the Lich as The Professor destroyed the Phylactery but not without having several near death experiences.  Surprised at his survival The Professor found renewed believe that his daughter was alive. Requesting a sabbatical from the Collective the Professor returned to study with the Woodsman. It was during this time that the strange little fellow of considerable power revealed that the Professor was under a strange and powerful spell. With a newfound hope for his daughter and a fresh mystery to solve Velethuil’adar Shalandaerl set off in search of an ancient artifact the Woodsman said would help break the dark magic that had its hold on him and help lead him to the truth."9/18/2017 9:01:31,Grellis Liadon,Elf ,Wizard ,"Grellis is one of the sole living survivors of a protracted assault on a lightening rail by a powerful Lich. As the Lich worked his way car by car toward the artifact he sought, the passengers were killed and raised as zombies to continue the attack, including Grellis' brother. Haunted by these memories, Grellis has thrown himself and the majority of his family's fortune into the study of Necromancy to understand, and one day destroy the undead where they hide in the world."9/18/2017 8:32:07,La'fein Melval,Elf (Drow),Bard,"She was born and raised in the Underdark, along with her younger sister, who she wasn’t particularly close to. Her parents despised the surface world and planned on grooming their daughter into a wizard that could give the surface world a reason to respect and fear the Drow, but she had other plans. Shirking her studies of magic often, she’d sneak off and explore the Underdark, and while still quite young, she discovered an underground racing rink, relatively close to an entrance to the surface world. Here, battlewagons consisted of two people (three if they could afford a larger wagon, one if they were particularly confident/foolish), usually a driver and some kind of ranged attacker, whether by spell or arrow. She was instantly taken by the atmosphere, and would sneak off often to watch the racers, intrigued by not only the racing, but also the wide variety of other races that she’d never seen before.Realising their efforts were wasted on La’fein, her parents focused on grooming their other daughter, who took to it more eagerly. While a little hurt by this, she took it as an opportunity to check out the racers more often, eventually leaving her home completely to shack up near the racers, still a child. It didn’t take long for her to be discovered, and she was taken to the leader of the rink, an elderly, but still spritely Deep Gnme, who took her in. She spent her youth, and a good portion of her adulthood here. Initially, they tried teaching her to drive, however this didn’t end so well (resulting in a crashed wagon and a few bumps and bruises). They attempted this a few more times, with equally bad results, before trying a different approach. They asked her what she liked most about the races, and she replied with the atmosphere; the adrenaline it gives people. She wanted to do that for others, so, they showed her to one of the races, one of the carts containing a halfling driver, and a human bard, strapped to the top, playing guitar and empowering their wagon. Immediately, La’fein was taken and determined to do just that, so, they taught her, and she took to it quickly.  First, she was taught the drums, which she excelled at, keeping a rhythm came naturally to her, though it took a bit more training to keep up the beat for an extended period of time. Then, around in her teens now, she took to learning instruments by herself, teaching herself guitar, with the aid of some mentors. Another racer taught her how to play the harp, which she found boring at first, but stuck with it, eventually using it to sooth stressed racers and such. She also picked up a warhorn, encouraging racers before a race (and inevitably getting on everyone’s nerves when she got carried away and overdid it). She studied under many mentors in a variety of instruments and techniques, learning to heal and empower allies, and disable and intimidate opponents. Sadly, during this training, the leader of the ring, who she’d come to look up to as a father, passed away. A new leader of the ring was chosen, and after mourning, she was determined to keep at it to make him proud.Before long, she was approaching adulthood, and determined to get into the ring and show off her musical prowess. She initially teamed up with another Drow woman, however while they enjoyed racing against each other, their synergy didn’t work out too well while in a cart together, so she introduced La’fein to a friend of hers, a Moon Elf named Gilthar Killevin. Initially, they argued off the track, but they were in perfect sync while racing. They were both as stubborn as each other, and before long their arguments become more jovial, and they developed a fondness for eachother. She learned that he was a ranger on the surface world. Part of a troop that protected the forests but he came her often on his off time. However due to his work, he’d have to leave the ring every now and then to work, and she found herself missing him. They grew closer, Gilthar even taking La’fein to the surface world a couple times so she could see it, bringing her back home to the Underdark before the sun rose so she wouldn’t be harmed by the sunlight (and so they wouldn’t encounter any surface dwellers. She never had a chance to tell him, but while the surface was beautiful, she was far too anxious to ever speak to any surface dwellers, despite to confident, hardcore persona she donned while racing) Before long, they married, and La’fein fell pregnant at 103. I young parent for an elf, but she wanted nothing else at that moment. Midway during her pregnancy, her husband got word of an intense mission which would mean he would need to be away from La’fein for a long amount of time, however he assured her he’d be there for the birth of their child. She said ‘I love you’ and kissed him goodbye. About halfway through this mission is when the Cataclysm hit. It shook the Underdark, the racing ring caving in, killing many racers. She and a number of other racers, including her Drow friend she’d race against were lucky enough to find themselves in a pocket under the rubble. A number of them being adept mages, they waiting to ensure there were no aftershocks, before making their way to the surface. There, they saw the damage, and it was absolute. Climbing out from the Underdark and touching the surface ground burned and blistered their hands, and while they, and a couple other small groups of racers struggled their way out of the rubble, it his La’fein that the likelihood of her husband surviving such a calamity was near impossible, and she grieved. Time went on and they soon realised that the Cataclysm was not a once off thing. The mages in their group found their magic going haywire, and the radiation was affecting all of them. Some members of their group died within the week, while the others started to suffer from deformities. La’fein feared for the safety of her child as her own skin paled and blisters after blisters would appear on her hands, rendering her incapable of much, let alone playing music. A few months went by and La’fein was now late in her pregnancy. While things were still grim, and their group now even smaller, they found they could adapt. Her Drow friend became something of a carer for her while the others managed to scavenge for scraps, eventually turning the rubble of their racing rink into a makeshift settlement. Here, La’fein gave birth to her daughter. It was a long, painful labour, but to La’fein’s relief, a successful one. Her child had the same mottled skin she had developed and her bones were deformed in places. Her knee joints bent in odd ways, and the ridges along her spine protruded through the skin, forming tiny spikes, explaining the painful labour, however her daughter shod no signs of pain. A cleric tended to them both and to La’fein’s relief, they were both alive, and as well as you can be in this new world. She named her Rua. Her little star. In this tiny, makeshift settlement, she raised her child, and all things considered, she had a good youth. La’fein’s electric guitar from her youth collected dust in the corner of their makeshift settlement, traded in for lullabies and a makeshift lyre. Despite her limp, her child was vital, finding joy in running and playing in the sands around their settlement, finding pieces of charcoal and drawing on whatever surface she could (including La’fein’s guitar, which she had charmed to keep it there permanently). As her daughter grew, she became just as wily and stubborn as her mother. They argued often, but it was never severe, just the result of sheer stubbornness from both sides. Rua would laugh whenever La’fein mentioned her past of playing that old electric guitar on the back of a wagon, saying how ridiculous that was, her mother being anything but her lame old mom. Over time, members of their little settlement left, including her Drow friend. While rare, they had a few visitors. Survivors from other regions, now riding large battle wagons which had become the norm in the large settlements they were supposedly from. Members of La’fein’s settlement were determined to look for better places, so off they went. Radiation had settled by now, and her hands had time to heal over completely, though now permanently calloused and scaly.As her child grew into a teenager, she showed an aptitude for the sands, and eventually at the age of 98, longed to explore them. A larger wagon happened by their settlement, and Rua begged her mother to let her go with them. Initially she hesitated, but she understood her daughter’s longing for something more, and refused to let her ingrained wariness of surface dwellers get in the way, so she allowed it. And so, Rua left on her own adventure with a band of unruly, but kind-hearted scavengers. So La’fein was left by herself. She tried to help aid in the settlement, but it wasn’t working for her. A century of staying put in one place had made her restless. So she found her own, smaller wagon, dusted off her old instruments, and rode off in search of her own adventure, far from ready to settle down for good."9/18/2017 8:36:26,Nai Limael,Elf (Wood),Druid,"An only child born into a near royal bloodline of Wood Elves, Nai’s early life was bustling with activity. The Limael bloodline had always revelled in celebrations, rather than politics, and for many, they were a welcome change to the boring or depressing politics of the nation. The forest they resided in was often bustling with activity, celebrating birthdays, anniversaries, holidays, or throwing festivities for a whole array of deities from the nature domain. Nai’s birth was no exception. The family were overjoyed by the birth of their daughter. She was tiny, with blonde hair, and the same vivid green eyes that were a speciality of the Limaels.   Yet another grand celebration was held for her, the new and only heir of the Nimael family line. Throughout her life, she was a slow learner. Speech came later to her than most, and Common tongue came to her even later. She could never hold a pencil quite right, and while she was able to pick up Elven script after a while, piecing together the written language of Common proved to be impossible. She was taught manners she didn’t understand, though some made it through (don’t touch things that aren’t yours. Say ‘please’ and ‘thank you’, as it makes people happy), put in frilly dresses that rubbed uncomfortably on her skin, and made to attend a huge number of celebrations every year, each one grander than the last. Nai quickly grew to dislike these celebrations. People would always crowd her, causing her to cry. She would be flooded with questions she didn’t know how to answer, and everything was just a bit too loud. People greeted her with smiles at first, but it never took long for those smiles to fade, and she couldn’t understand why. Was it something she said? Despite her dislike for them, these celebrations became more frequent, and even larger. The heads of the Limael family made the decision to start cutting down trees in the area. A common complaint was how difficult it was to get to the Limael residence, located at the heart of a forest neighbouring the coast. As a result, the first course of action was making paths, so more people could attend. Net, they pushed the forest back further, creating new areas for accommodation, so now even those coming from great distances could attend regularly, always welcome to stay in the new accommodation areas. More and more forest was cut back, and this distressed Limael, as well as some of the elder members of the Limael family line. The elders tried to explain that they were straying from their roots as Wood Elves, but their arguments fell on deaf ears. Nai herself tried to speak up. She liked the forest, and didn’t like seeing it get cut down. It meant less squirrels to sit with, less rabbits to run alongside, and the birds could never be heard over the mass of people almost always present. When she tried to bring this up with her parents, she was brushed aside. “Mommy is busy sweetie.”, she said, and this just upset Nai more. She couldn’t understand why they couldn’t see what they were doing was bad. But she didn’t bring it up again. Many awkward conversations and hurt feelings later, guests learned to avoid conversation with Nai. She didn’t mind so much, it meant she could be left to her own devices, but she wished she knew why. But one day it all got too much. Everyone was too loud, and the forest she loved was barely recognisable. She looked to her parents, who were happily chatting with various nobles, and to her, they seemed happy enough. They had their parties, and plenty of other people to talk to. So, Nai made the decision to leave. She left unnoticed, heading south, and eventually hitting the shore. Kicking off her uncomfortable shoes she was made to wear, she loved the feeling of the sand between her toes, and the quiet, but constant sound of the waves. Much better than that loud uncomfortable “forest”. So, she walked. She headed West along the coast, and she just kept walking. She dawdled often. Spotting flowers growing just off the shore, she would wander off to pick them and add them to her hair. She’d hours in a spot of sand that had a particularly beautiful selection of shells and rocks, pouring over them and picking a select few to carry with her, always making sure not to take too much from one area. She travelled alone for a fair amount of time, but it wasn’t long before she found company. Or rather, company found her. Her hair, tousled and tangled from the ocean wind, now housed many beautiful shells, pebbles, and flowers. Certain aspects of it sparkled in the light, and that attracted attention. A young crow, with pitch black feathers and ice blue eyes, took notice of Nai’s hair. Or rather, the sparkly objects inside it, and attempted to grab one for himself. Their first meeting wasn’t the best. The crow tries to yank a particularly shiny shell out of Nai’s hair, but it was tangled in the deeply. After a minute of startled screams, cawing, and hair pulling, the crow left. But it never strayed far. It watched for a day or so, thinking hard. It wanted that shell, but it wouldn’t budge. So, rather than taking the shell to its collection, it decided to bring the rest of the collection to the shell. The crow left, and returned shortly after with a bottlecap, tucking it neatly into Nai’s hair. Nai didn’t mind this so much, and promised the crow she wouldn’t touch it, and keep it safe. Then he took off again. …And, returned once more, this time with a gold coin. And again, this time with another shell, from another beach far away. And again, with a dried sprig of mistletoe. Before long, the crow had turned Nai’s hair into a new nest. Again, she didn’t mind at all. She enjoyed the company, and decided to name the crow ‘Korko’, which is ‘crow’ in Elvish. Korko cawed in apparent approval of the name, and they became fast friends. After a long while of travelling together, Nai got her first real taste of the dangers she was facing. A storm hit, and the usually calm, blue coast she travelled along, turned a menacing grey, water choppy and dangerous. The storm directly overhead, lightning flashed and thunder clapped simultaneously, and the water rose to dangerous levels. Pure luck saved her. A natural cave in the stone, high enough to be out of reach of the rising tide, could be seen not far from her. She scrambled out to safety, a frazzled Korko clinging to her hair, and waited out the storm, safe and dry in this cave, just warm enough to keep her comfortable. The storm subsided, and Nai left the cave, seeing for the first time the havoc nature can cause. A number of fish lay dead of the sand, and in the other direction, Nai could see a far-off forest, and even at this distance, she could see a large number of trees felled by the brute force of the wind. She continued her walk along the coast, and it wasn’t long before she came across something that really hit home how powerful nature can be. An enormous piece of driftwood, not far off of being a full tree, had washed ashore. It lay with its top branches propped up on the cliffs, its roots meeting the water at low tide. Awed, she picked a part of the tree, hollowed out at some point, and used her strength to tear it off. Heavy, and larger than expected, it felt uncomfortable in her grip at first, but it didn’t take long for her to find the best way to carry this encumbering piece of driftwood. But, she had her mind set. This tree had its own, fearsome beauty, and this piece of it served as a reminder that nature is not to be underestimated. So, she kept it, and, taking a leaf of out Korko’s metaphorical book, she started to decorate it. Unknown to her, it wasn’t luck that had Nai discover that cave. No, it was something more divine. Nai was never able to remember the various deities her family would celebrate. She knew none of their names. But, without her knowledge, these gods and goddesses knew her name, and by now, they knew it quite well. Deities with control over the nature domain found the Limael’s destruction of the forests offensive, and worse still, hypocritical, as I was done it order to supposedly celebrate them. The gods had been keeping an eye on the Limael’s for some time, and seeing Nai simply walk off the way that she did entertained them greatly. Nai’s ‘luck’ was rather a direct result of their influence. Subtle, but just enough to keep her safe and healthy. Berries would come into fruit well before their time, edible tubers would be surprisingly close to the surface, fires for warmth would take just a little bit less to start, and last just a bit longer. Predatory animals would take no notice of the young girl and her crow, and shelter could always be found. Taking care of Nai as she walked became something of a game for the gods, and even the more sinister deities would take part. The Limael’s, distraught over their daughter’s disappearance, used every means possible to find her, but they never could. Storms would hit any boats searching for her. Searching parties by foot would find themselves hunted by wolves, and through a presence unknown to Nai, any magical attempts to find her were blocked. They searched for years before calling off their efforts, deeming it fruitless, but Nai was always blissfully unaware. She kept walking, with a skip in her step, driftwood in her hands, Korko by her side, and gods at her back. And so, she kept travelling. Walking along the coast, deciding to see more of the world and taking a detour, before deciding to head back. She had no means of knowing where she was, but she had her own unique way of having a general idea of where she was. Large rock formations that had no other significance served as landmarks, remembered fondly because they looked like her favourite animals, though the resemblance was often very obscure. She zigzagged across the continent, occasionally backtracking, wishing to spend time at a particularly nice creek gain, or turning around to climb a specific tree because she liked the view and wanted to see it again. And throughout all this, the gods would continue to check up on her occasionally, giving her a little helping hand if she ever needed it. After many, many years of wandering, Nai happens across a vast forest. It’s vivid green, and gorgeous, and lusher than any she’s ever seen before, so, of course, she enters. Unknown to her, however, she’s being watched, and not just by the gods. An elderly, druid man, keeps a careful eye on her, not wanting to scare her, but ready if she ever poses a threat to this forest that he’s become a part of. She wanders among the trees, taking in the sights, but never noticing the old druid. However, on the night of the full moon, she does encounter something peculiar. A disc, floating, large enough for her to step into if she wished. It looks like a mirror, reflected in it, an incredible forest, not unlike the one she’s in right now, but vastly superior. Larger, more beautiful, with plant life growing in ways she’s never seen. She steps into this mirror-like portal, and the druid man, who’s been keeping a careful watch moves to stop her, calling out a second too late. He opens his mouth to yell out to her, but she steps through, and suddenly, she is gone from this plane.Nai finds herself in a new, extraordinary world, inhabited by creatures and plants she’d never seen before, not on land, nor from the ocean. The trees here are taller than any she had ever seen, and vines wrap themselves around the branches with intricate detail. Fungus grows on the floor of the forest, the fruiting bodies easily ten times bigger than any Nai had ever encountered, softly glowing a variety of hues, and the moss under her feet is softer than any sand. She wanders for a while, progress slow as she pauses to take in all the sites, choosing to take one item from this place. A small skull, the size of her fist, which she adds to her staff. Korko also finds some things of interest, adding a number of odd flowers to Nai’s hair, which appear to settle themselves in, wrapping roots around a small section of hair and happily adjusting to this new, mobile place of residence. It takes a number of days before she finds anyone sentient, and when she does, they’re shocked to see her. A pair of Satyr, understanding that she must be lost, ask where she came in from, and, knowing the lay of this land, agree to help her get home. She learns that that particular portal won’t open for a month, so they show here around in the meantime. While here, she never learns where she is, but she knows it’s beautiful, and extraordinary, and unlike anything she’s seen thus far, so she focuses on soaking up every gorgeous detail of the landscape, from the trees, to winding rivers not bound to any riverbed, to mountains that go high into the clouds.The month passes in a flash, and before she knows it, she’s guided back to the portal. The satyr wave goodbye, and she passes back through, reappearing in the same location she went through, the same lush forest, which now seems somewhat drab in comparison to the wonders that she’d just seen. But she and Korko aren’t alone in the forest. Standing in front of her is the druid that had been watching her a month prior. He looks as shocked to see her and she is to see him, and finally, he speaks first, asking how she survived and how long she thinks she was gone for. Taken aback by these questions at first, she answers honestly. She was helped by some satyrs, and she was gone for a month exactly. To her surprise, the druid shakes his head, and invites her to come with him. He takes her to his home. A humble shelter, consisting of just a roof and a makeshift bed and fire pit. He introduced himself as Oberon, and he explains that the place she had just been to was known as the FeyWild. When he first came to this forest, he went through the same portal. For him though, he was trapped in there for five years. It took him that long to figure out the timing of that portal, but when he came back through, everything was the same. His memories of the place are fuzzy, but he vividly recalls the state of things before he went through the portal, and he quickly figured out that he had only been gone for 5 minutes. Initially, he thought that time in the FeyWild was just much slowly than this plane, but Nai has proved that this is not the case. He’s been keeping track of time for her, and Nai is surprised to her that a month passed in the Feywild, but here, in this plane, she had been gone for 15 years. Oberon is surprised by Nai’s relative lack of reaction, and he eventually lowers his voice, asking if she’s a druid. Nai admits she doesn’t know what that is, and Oberon chuckles, saying that’s not a surprise. He asks Nai to stay with him a while, he’s had no company for a long time, and he’d appreciate it very much, as he’s getting older. Nai doesn’t quite understand this, but she agrees. Oberon is an eccentric old man, but Nai grows to enjoy his company greatly, even if the conversations don’t make sense and are very one sided.  Weeks pass before he says he’s willing to teach her Druid magic. Nai admits she doesn’t know what that means, and he happily demonstrates. Nai watched as he takes a breath, closing his eyes, and then, smooth as silk, his form changes into that of a bear, a little shaggier than average, and pure white. He changes back and immediately Nai agrees. She’s never seen magic like this, and she’s keen to learn, so, they begin. First, he teaches her Druidic. Teaches her the script, the speech, and how to sense druidic messages in an area, and she takes to it faster than even Elvish. Then, she teaches her to manipulate nature. He explains the Druids don’t ‘control’ nature, they’re an extension of its will, it’s protectors. They’re one with the natural world, and it is one with them. Nai takes to these lessons like a duck to water, and he teaches her the basics of Wild Shape. He teaches her basic survival skills, and gifts her one of his furs, enchanted to keep her warm and dry, no matter what the weather. He always warns her of the dangers of being a Druidic. Telling her with spite in his voice that there are folk that want this branch of magic gone. He recognises that names are lost on Nai, so her draws out a symbol. A religious symbol, and explains to her that anyone that bears this symbol is not to be trusted. He explains in vivid detail a druid culling, where members of this group targeted and killed many people like them, and almost succeeded. But, some druids survived, and like a flower in crack in cobblestone, nature will grow and adapt, as will the druids. He explains that she cannot use Wild Shape in front of others, unless she absolutely trusts them, and that teaching the Druidic language to anyone other than a Druid is forbidden, and she understand from the tone of his voice alone that she’s been trusted with something great.However, their time together is relatively short. Reaching the end of his significant life, Oberon falls. He explains the a confused Nai that this is how nature works. Druids are blessed to be able to be one with it for an extended period of time, but every creature has their time, and this is his. She asks what she can do for him, and he simply replies that he wishes to be buried at the base of the giant Oak at the centre of this forest, and she complies. With his last strength, they move him there, and he passes away peacefully. Nai doesn’t understand death, but she knows he is gone. She grants his wish, burying him, and sits by his grave, and in her own, silent way she mourns. Upon leaving, she takes an acorn from this tree and a memento of her teacher, and much-loved friend. She places it in her staff, and within a couple of days, it takes root and grows, producing a single, bright green oak leaf. Nai doesn’t notice, but since this, the staff gradually feels lighter to her, and is easier to carry, this large chunk of driftwood now becoming a focus for her magic. She continues her travels, practising her magic whenever she’s confident no one is around. But then, one day, Korko does something he’s never done since their first meeting. He pesters her. He comes back from a flight, scrap of paper in hand. It’s written in common, so Nai doesn’t understand what it says, but she can tell that Korko is trying to tell her something. So, she follows him. She follows him West, and eventually, South, to a small town she would later learn goes by the name of Narazar."9/18/2017 20:16:28,Proxy,Fey Corgi,Barbarian,Pirate quartermaster who is illiterate.9/18/2017 20:27:15,Sauerkraut ,Fey Corgi,Ranger,Mentally disabled ranger who has issues using a gun and training animals; so he trains larger bugs and uses a sling. he is the dog you see in the park who chews on grass and then licks a tree for a few hours. 9/18/2017 20:24:12,Pad Lock,Fey Corgi,Rogue,A rogue that found out slavery was a better trade than adventuring.

Longing to prove herself as a worthy daughter, a competent hero, a good human, Nellyn spun wool quietly in her room and learned to use her charm and beauty to her advantage whenever she was allowed outdoors.Her life changed one day when a satyr, dressed in royal garb, arrived at her parents door with a scroll glowing faintly of moonlight.  Within the scroll was an official notice of courtship, a formal request from the Archfey Maiden of the Moon, who declared her intentions to wed Nellyn--her ancient fey bloodlines were of political import to the Maiden, and the marriage would be purely out of social convenience.  In return for accepting her hand, the Maiden offered Nellyn magical abilities and a chance to leave her quiet home and truly prove herself.  Nellyn readily accepted, leaving behind the family that was all too glad to send her away, and hopes to earn the favor--and perhaps even the love--of her betrothed."9/18/2017 17:35:54,Fiammetta di Garazzolo,Fire genasi,Vengeance paladin,"Fiammetta, born to a well-known Baldurian merchant family, had always been somewhat the spoiled sort as a child; though her Efreet father had been rightfully run out of town when she was barely old enough to walk, the word ""want"" was nonetheless rarely found in her vocabulary, as what could someone want who already has nearly everything? During her days, or at least when she was not helping tend to the affairs of the House of Garazzolo's thriving caravan business, she could often be found taking a stroll not through the wealthier parts of town, but through the poorest, going on ""slum safari"" as she and her friends would call it, flashing her wealth and often donating it to the needy she would encounter — not out of some genuine desire to help, but rather out of one to remind them of who is on top.But though her life was often easy, rarely is not never, and after seeing her consummately honest mother's business destroyed by a significantly less honest competitor employing scores of Orcish bandits, what Fiammetta wanted more than anything was justice. After forming a failed coalition with several other nobles to round up the people responsible — hiring mercenaries of their own to do the dirty work — she found that delegation was not for her, and decided that if you want a job done right, you have to do it yourself.It was not long after that that she gathered what money she could, placed some orders with the local blacksmith, and set out to do just that."9/18/2017 12:04:11,Glim Nim Pock,Forest gnome,Ranger,"His clan was killed by giants when he was a child, but he managed to hide. An elven friend of the family, Sinfler Greenleaf, helped him survive and trained him to survive and take revenge."9/18/2017 10:35:16,Capsaicin Blunderstab,Forest Gnome,Rogue,"The birth of a Forest Gnome is a wondrous thing to behold. I don’t know exactly how other types of gnomes give birth, I’ve never seen it. But us forest folk? Well, it’s a sight. We’re born casting illusions, and some of the more mystically inclined folks in the clans like to say the first illusions of a newborn help set the fate of that gnome, and set them on their path in life, and the majority of the clans tend to believe them. Some, like my cousin Goldencircle, come out blasting growing trees, fountains of arcane life, and the calming glow of the central Forest. Others, like my brother, Brindleberry, show a series of other figures working alongside them, building great tunnels and intricate mechanisms above and below the trees with sweeping gestures of a many-branched wand. So, it’s not all that surprising that  I lived a lot of my life treated like a rare and dangerous thing. Far from the magical and natural picture-shows of the rest of Clan Forestward, I was born appearing to have blades in both hands. My Uncle, Crosswood, once said “Chirpy (that was his nickname for me between the ages of 20 and 30. More on our proclivity for naming things soon), you damn near gave your old grandmother her death with your appearance. First, the thing with the swords. THEN, you projected all sorts of horrors around the room, each of them running towards you, and each of them somehow missing you, to disappear into some corner or other.” Sure enough, Grandmother Phloremore never really warmed up to me, and always sent me on the most physical and dangerous tasks outside of our warren. She once snidely remarked that it was due to my mother’s Rock Gnome bloodline, and I dismissed it at the time, but thinking back, it’s probably at least partly true. So, some background on my warren: The Forestward clan, as our name implies, are protectors of our little branch of Home Forest. Mostly, that involves attending to the growth of things, balancing out the workings of predator and prey, leading foreigners away before they can interfere with us, and learning new magics. Oh, the magics. We’re a very studious bunch, us Forestwards. We have a long tradition of sending the best and brightest of us off to the various wizarding colleges of the land, and those best and brightest continue to make a name for themselves for a bit abroad, performing what some think of as miracles, but what we know are family-kept secrets, before coming back by their hundredth birthday to resume the mantle of Warden of Home. In this way, at our coming of age ceremony, the most important part of the week-long festival  is the Magical Aptitude, Recognition and Knowledge portion, or MARK. My clan never really worried about MARK day, really. Generation upon generation of Forestward names are grown into the top of the MARK tree, and if you touch those names, they’ll show you a preserved illusion of the events that brought them, and our family, the honor and reverence of the surrounding forest. My own MARK test was what some might call an unmitigated disaster. I tend to think it was somewhat mitigated, but that’s neither here nor there. See, as I grew, I was more of the bruiser type, by looks. Tall for a gnome, and far stronger and more acrobatic than my peers, I grew up at the tops of the trees, swinging where others could only occasionally climb, catching the animals unaware in their dens and hunting with their young. I learned how to catch a bird in flight by the time I was 15, how to forage enough meat, nuts and berries by 17, and by the time I came of age at 25, I was fully able to cross the entire Clansgrove unseen carrying several times my own weight in material. On the day of my MARK, there were five of us up for admission into the wizard’s grove: My forementioned cousin, Goldencircle, who I’ve always gotten along well with and share many childhood memories with; Balliecharm, a young man from the Spectraldeer Clan who I barely knew, but seemed to resent me for some reason or other; Callieflower, who I courted once, awkwardly, and who I could never get anything right around; Calladario, her brother, who liked me fine before my MARK, but not so much after; and myself. The others spoke their charms, summoned their fae creatures, lit their fires, and performed their minor miracles easily enough, to the glee of the judges. As for my MARK, well, the headmaster eventually recovered fully, and the nickname Blunderstab sticks with me to this day. Hell, I self-apply it, to remember where I’m from, so to speak. Oh, yeah. Names. We gnomes really love naming things, and each other. You might hear of me as Chirpy, Stelfins, Elftalker, Grounder, Cereliphian, Dragonpunch, or Formie, or any of a dozen others, depending on who’s talking. Some of those come from interesting incidents, some just sounded good to someone. Anyway, we name things by our moods towards them at the time, and it changes depending on all sorts of circumstances. I don’t know how you big people do it, keeping just one name all the time for each other, when sometimes you just feel differently towards each other constantly. It just adds a lot of context to how you interact is all I’m saying. After my MARK disaster, I was denied admission to the Magegrove for further instruction, and had to find my own way. The next couple of years were less than ideal for me. I’d been somewhat shamed, didn’t have much of a career path set for me, and was avoiding everyone who was caught in what was called the “MARK of the long knives,” which is hard in a bustling warren like ours. I took to becoming somewhat invisible, honing my natural skills to the point where I only could be found when I wanted to be. I managed to strike up a few good friendships with local elves, and would occasionally trade them secrets learned from the local animals for lessons in the Fae language and additional blade practice. It seemed a fair trade, and a useful skillset. Where others might have used these skills to empty the local treasuries and move on, I took to sneaking into the wizard’s grove to peek in on the studies going on there. Some of that might have been friendly competition with my cousin, some might have been to see more of Callieflower. It was my rebellious 30s and 40s, I can’t explain it better than that. Anyway, that’s where most of my magic comes from these days. I saw the effects from a distance in hiding, and have spent the intervening years reverse-engineering the effects using my own latent magical powers. Something in my Rock Gnome blood led me to fiddling about with various materials to duplicate the effects magic couldn’t, and I used that to self-teach myself as, well, I wasn’t sure what I was being called to, just that all this tinkering, stealthily moving about, and being able to out-fight anyone in my clan seemed very important to me. Taking risk upon risk only could hold out so long, however. Shortly before my former MARK-mates graduated from the local school and moved on to the bigger wizard’s academy, to join others of our clans that had stayed there to teach, that my luck finally ran out. I think it was Balliecharm, actually, who cast a spell I haven’t been able to duplicate yet, that sent me hurtling from the nearby nook I was auditing the class from and into the circle formed by the class. It was a unique case, as nobody had ever been caught sneaking INTO a school in our long history. It was finally decided that although no crime was committed, it might be best for me and my clan (and by that I mean mostly my clan) if I were to see the world and serve the needs of the Home Forest abroad. I was tasked with seeing the world, righting wrongs, gathering information, and making myself known in the world, but I was never given a timetable to come back and report. I never asked, and I found a kind of joy on the road, so I never sought out the road home. There would be plenty of time for that, later. That was about 30 years ago now, and I’m approaching the age where a gnome of my station should consider doing his one great deed abroad before settling down in the Home Forest to continue to serve the Braided Clans. My former classmates are almost graduated from their academy, and should be taking their own journeys abroad in the next year to see the world and to enjoy what of it they can. With that in mind, and hoping to maybe see one or more of them on their journey, I recently heard tell of a great unrest on the borderlands to the south, and journeyed where rumor and weather led me, until one night, camping with strangers found upon the road, we were surprised by a goblin attack. The rest, as they say, is history. "9/17/2017 23:22:43,Mari Voidstalker,genasi,Wizard Warlord hybrid ,She was taken in by a necromancer and taught the ways of dark magic. one day she accidentally brought the towns dead back to life and chaos ensued so she escaped.9/18/2017 9:35:25,Redruthite,Genasi,Sorcerer,"Being part-elemental, was a guinea pig for some dragon cultists; some adventurers freed him; dedicated himself to follow their steps; trained himself in the art of wielding greatswords; was killed in a dungeon; was resurrected by Bahamut and became his prophet/evangelist; encountered a darker half of Ao who was inclined to destroy everything and gambled; now leads a party of wannabe-superheroes who were cursed for immortality by said half; was buried for 45 years in the collapsed cave; was stranded for a year alone without a leg and any means to forage any food; accidentaly, while trying to save his unconcious friends after this yeard passed, got almost killed in a dungeon and was left here for nine years until another band of adventurers found them. being immortal is fucked up, turns out."9/18/2017 2:58:58,Aquis,Genasi,Druid,"When Aquis was 5 years old, her life changed. Her father, Aukitza, was a Genie. Aukitza married a young human woman, Rose, and had their first child, Dinnis. The people of the main Kingdom would torment him for their wishes to be answered, so Aukitza decided to leave to have some peace in their lives. He found a travelling group of nomads that consisted of Clerics and Druids trying to cope with poverty in the harsh deserts to the west. There, they flourished. Rose became a priestess and Aukitza helped raise new temples and barns. Eventually they had another child, Aquis. Aquis, like her brother Dinnis, was a Water Genasi. The two of them could create clean water to fill the reservoirs for the clergymen and poor of the temples. One fateful night, upon arriving home, Rose walked into an ambush that had been set up by a corrupt group of men from the main Kingdom. They demanded that Aukitza grant them a wish, or they would kill him. Aukitza, while inherently magical, actually had no ability to cast a wish. Then, one of the guards killed Dinnis, who was only 7. Aquis watched in horror as her mother and father were helpless to meet the demands of these warriors. They then threatened to take Roses life. Aukitza looked into Aquis' eyes, and with his last words said ""I'm sorry"", as he charged forward attempting to grab his scimitar off the wall, when Rose was struck down. As the guards went to apprehend Aukitza, one of the guards made what appeared to be a killing strike on him and he burst into smoke. The guards started shouting at each other, thinking they could maybe take his daughter for ransom, but ultimately decided to leave because there was nothing more they could do without the Genie who was dead. So they left. Aquis cried until the morning clutching her dead mother, where she ran out of energy to carry on. The tribesmen found her and decided to bury Rose and Dinnis and hold a funeral that night. Aquis remained with the small group of nomads which formed into a small town of 1,000. While she mostly worked in the temple, she was always interested in the druids of their settlement, and noticed that one of them was a survivalist trainer. After filling the water reservoirs in the church, she would go train with the druids, eventually learning interesting magic from them. She vows to get revenge on the band of warriors that slayed her family in front of her, and wields her father's scimitar in the hopes that she crosses their paths. Little does she know, her father is still alive."9/18/2017 11:35:54,Sod,Genasi,Sorceror,"Sod was raised in a relatively mild-mannered wood genasi family in the woods far to the east of the Southron Lands. For generations, Sod's family has cultivated weapons grown from the very woods in which they lived, a careful process that takes a great deal of attention and is done with meditative focus. Although not well known by name, due to the humble nature of his community, the weapons produced in his familial grove have earned an impressive reputation for sturdiness, reliability, and impeccable craftsmanship. While Sod’s family has never taken up arms themselves in any sort of organized, martial fashion, they nonetheless take a great deal of pride in the work of their hands, choosing to believe that their weapons are always deployed in self-defense, of either one’s one self or one’s own people. Their connection with the earth runs deep, and through this recognize that conflict is one turn of the wheel of a peaceable society.Sod, a rambunctious youth, never quite fit in with his family. The wood genasi family of which he is a part is generally open and accepting but nonetheless is driven by rather stoic and conservative values, privileging family, tradition, craft, and above all, peaceful coexistence with nature. Sod, a loud, gregarious youth, more interested in a good story and meaty pun than the stolid assessments of recent rainfall and preparations for the upcoming harvest, found himself often at the outskirts of conversations. Despite an intense desire for the community that seemed to be proffered by his village, he was never quite able to find his way in, no matter how good his card tricks. He gamboled and jape through most of his youth, but knew that his life was meant for something different.  For Sod, this disjunction between the perceived comfort of his upbringing and his yearning for an outside became increasingly difficult to reconcile when, as he moved into his adolescence, he began to realize that his connection with nature went beyond the demi-religious and traditional and in fact manifested in his realization that he was intrinsically entwined with what others about the world call “wild magic.” His first encounters with magic were haphazard and uncontrolled – an unexpected fireball here, a little light telekinesis there – which he and his family did his damndest, in a campaign of self-denial, to write off as youthful imagination run roughshod. However, at a certain point, his natural aptitude for magic could no longer remain secret, when, in the midst of a particularly vivid daydream, he inadvertently cast a flaming sphere that engulfed a broad swath of juvenile longspears that his family had been cultivating for 35 harvests.His family, while supportive of his odd personality and his occasional magical mishaps, grew increasingly wary of the destructive potential of his newfound magical potential. Paired with his temperamental differences, his newfound magical identity proved a particularly challenging obstacle to his fitting in with his community, and while there was never any direct hostility – the wood genasi being a peaceable, respectful people on the whole and his community being a particularly accepting one, all things considered – he nonetheless felt the pressures of being different compounding. His outgoing nature never quite fit in, and once word spread of his “condition,” he found it ever more difficult to find his way within his society. Despite the pressures of his community, he nonetheless found the time to practice his newfound abilities, seeking out secluded glens in which he could attempt to cultivate his magical abilities, with dead saplings suffering the brunt of his early attempts at reigning in his power. It was in one of these arboreal hideouts that he first discovered his ability to summon Frank, his stalwart hedgehog companion, with whom he shares a strong bond of friendship.When Sod reached late adolescence, he knew it was time to leave, and he took it upon himself to seek out the broader world beyond his coniferous confines. Choosing a prime shortspear from the latest harvest, and gaining the reluctant support of his parents, he made his way shortly to Pole by way of his affability and impressive intuition for navigating local taverns in search of adventures large and small."9/18/2017 12:41:34,SweerTar,Ghostwise Halfling,Druid,"Orphaned after their wagon set ablaze, killing his parents.  SweerTar found himself alone on the streets of Waterdeep ""procuring"" food to survive.  His only friends being the creatures of the city who were just as despairing as himself.  It wouldn't last long though.  Soon less favorable institutions discovered his small size and special ability to communicate telepathically a great benefit.  SweerTar quickly rose through the ranks at a young age as a quite formidable thief and look out.  Until one day the mark was a magical bag found inside a lesser known Druid Guild in Waterdeep.  Although SweerTar procured the bag, he was soon caught of guard. Dumbfounded as how he triggered a spell that made all the house plants grow and grab his body.  Holding him there until the authorities came.  At his trial, which would ultimately lead to death or hard labor, an elder Wood Elf Druid named Rolen, convinced the court of something different.  Rolen would take the young SweerTar and have him work off his punishment in the Druid's Guild.  Thus was his life until he reached adulthood.  Life wasn't all bad though.  SweerTar found himself fully fed, clothed, and educated in a short time.  Simple spells were learned where he could manipulate earth and water, even produce a small flame in his hand to light candles or fires.  The little freedom SweerTar had was dedicated to helping his oldest friends, the animals of the city.  No other before had advocated for the dangerous dog packs, the wretched rat, or the packs of cats in heat.  Rolen enjoyed watching SweerTar engage these animals and with little effort taught the first of his many great spells.  The spell that allowed him to talk to animals.  Not long after SweerTar had the greatest communication network in the city and beyond.  Good and bad stories all around but the need to help those taken advantage of sprung forth.  Thus started SweerTar's quest to not only help the animals of the city but also the injustices caused by a piece of his past, his old Thieve's Guild."9/18/2017 18:59:36,Rydell Hellcalled,Ghoul Medusa,Stalker,"Rydell is not precisely what'd you'd expect from an ancient undead abomination. For the most part she seems very much like a kindly grandmother who instead of dozing in a rocking chair affixes herself at the front of a ship, acting as a living figurehead. She tends to have tea and hard candies on hand to offer to folks, and she can usually be found absentmindedly rolling a jawbreaker around in her mouth.Only that's not a jawbreaker. It's a bullet. And the reason it's in her mouth is because she's coating the damned thing in venom, and as a member of the living dead she isn't worried in the slightest about lead poisoning.The old ghoul has seen and done just about everything and she's always ready and eager to share some of her wisdom on various subjects, though her memory has gotten a bit spotty since she got shot in the head quite awhile ago, and spent a few centuries sleeping it off.Which is how she's ended up in the Dreamscape in the first place. She murdered everyone aboard a ship at sea and attached herself to the front of it disguised as a figurehead, and then woke up some time later attached to a complete different ship in a completely different plane.Precisely how much of her personality is original and how much is head trauma is something that she doesn't quite remember. She remembers being part of a literal adventuring band in the past, all musicians of some sort. A bearded, mighty thewed orcish barbarian guitarist who would shred on his axe and then shred with his axe, a tiefling druid guitarist who played instruments of living wood, a goblin vocalist who was also in charge of pyrotechnics and was a real Jekyll and Hyde diva, a human violinist whose sorrowful tunes would wake the dead, and herself a young Elven beauty who played wind instruments who could be so haunting that it formed spectral shapes that became real.Those days are long gone, and she does not even remember their names, but their deeds set her on the path to being the monster that she is today. She can recall something terrible occurring, something that twisted and warped them all, changing Rydell from a beautiful Elven maiden in a copper-played, winged abomination blooded by the elves' ancient rivals the dwarves.In questing to restore her elven beauty, Rydell only found herself becoming more monstrous. Her once heroic self turned towards the darkness, valuing her lost looks over all. To that end she eventually became one of many cultists brought together by an enigmatic group known as the Quills, who seek to gain knowledge (especially dark and forbidden knowledge.) The cult concealed themselves as devotees of a goddess of beauty, dwelling in ""The City in the Valley,"" a vast metropolis where all things art and beauty were celebrated.Attempting to bring something (she no longer recalls what) horrific and powerful into the world and eager to reap rewards for doing so, the cultists drew the direct ire of the goddess they had been masquerading as followers of. The goddess unleashed her wrath upon the beautiful City in the Valley. Those within found themselves transformed into reflections of their inner selves, Rydell and many of her fellow cultists altered into serpentine forms befitting their status as treacherous, backstabbing snakes, their hair transformed into a writhing nest of serpents to represent their co-conspirators.But the good people in the City in the Valley were not spared the horrors that befell their sinister neighbors.The dark powers invoked to try and bring the Great Horror into the world twisted the weather, forming an immense, ceaseless blizzard in the midst of summer in a land that had never known the caress of snow. Even had visibility been decent, the valley passes would have been choked by snow, the the high winds destroying any ship that dared attempt the escape.And so the good people of the City in the Valley fell to the monsters the goddess of beauty had created, as did many of the monsters.Amongst them Rydell's life ended, and her unlife began.Risen as a Lacedon, a horrific aquatic ghoul, Rydell was able to escape the charnel house that the City in the Valley had become, protected from the billowing gale above by so much icy water. Her undead form immune to the chill of the water around her.Mind and body broken by the incident, Rydell found herself bereft of many of her former bardic abilities, though she did retain some aspects of her ability to perform as well as serving as a font of knowledge. But her abilities were just as warped. Her capacity for knowledge came from whispers from her serpentine hair, each snake seeming to house a portion of the knowledge of each member of her cult in miniature. Her bardsong no longer able to inspire courageous deeds as it once did, instead serving as a muted echo of the corruptive song that the goddess of beauty sang sealing the City in the Valley to its fate, empowering her allies with physical and mental alterations and empowerments.From there the memories grow blurry, Rydell recalls training to gain martial prowess to replace the spellcasting capability the goddess' curse had robbed from her. Scraps of memory place her studying at the vaunted Crashing Tempest Academy, which seeks to study every aspect of fighting no matter how unorthodox, serving as a Judge of the Scales of Morning, seeking to preserve the balance between life, death, and undeath (usually by applying death and undeath in places where life has gotten a titch too big for its britches), and serving for quite some time as a privateer.Rydell recalls being far, far more powerful than she currently is, rather sure that the bullet to the head took away her memories of her strongest abilities and techniques, as well as requiring a great deal of power to be expended to restore her body from the brink of destruction. But seeing her in combat one can easily see her prowess. One can also see that quite frequently she's holding back. She seems to want to give her foes a sporting chance as well as allowing her shipmates, who don't have decades (possible centuries) of adventuring experience to figure out how things are done. But if situations are sufficiently dire, she will unleash her full, terrifying combat prowess.Though capable of creating more lacedons, Rydell is usually loathe to do so. She doesn't want to leave a trail of rampaging ghouls behind her wherever she goes. She doesn't have the time, or the interest, to personally oversee each one and make sure they're under her thrall, as well as keeping them under her power. Left to their own devices her babies have a tendency to be naughty and not particularly hospitable to her living (and tasty) crewmates.Sure, they could likely be fed raw meat in the ship's mess, but Rydell's gargoyle-like nature is essentially the only aspect of her monstrous form that she CAN'T pass on to somebody. Meaning that they'll be quite ravenous and frequently hungry, instead of only occasionally requiring a bit of rare steak, or a chicken breast run through a warm roomAlso she doesn't want to impugn on the captain's hospitality, after all. And suddenly dumping a pile of powerful undead guests in the ship's lap needing to be fed raw meat frequently is not a particularly polite thing to do.Though if asked, she'll happily kill someone and have them reborn as an undead abomination under her thrall. Despite being quite grandmotherly, she is actually rather happy to go about killing and murdering and whatnot."9/18/2017 17:47:28,Zeth,Githyanki,Warlock,"Zeth was raised in an academy to be a knight. Typically, the way to become a Githyanki knight is to kill a Mindflayer in single combat. Unfortunately, he was something of a weeaboo for Illithids, having secretly learned their unholy language, which he practised by whispering erotic phrases to his Mindflayer body pillow. As such, when he entered the ring to complete his final assessment and kill a Mindflayer, he got painfully aroused and started trying to chat it up. When the onlookers realised what he was doing, they chased him off and banished him permanently from the realm. He stole a red dragon and tried to escape, but as they were flying into the material plane, he made an incredibly pervy comment to the dragon, who tipped him off onto a mountainside."9/18/2017 14:12:53,Timon LockJaw,Gnoll,Cleric,"Timon split away from his tribe of Gnolls, hunting those that couldn't fight back felt wrong and cowardly to him.

Their way of worshiping their god was to spill blood in his name, and slaughtering all in their wake. Gnozz's heart was never really in it though. He took part in their raids and slaughter but only because it was what he was raised to do, not because he lusted for it like the others. He was much more attuned to his Hyena spirit than his fiendish blood. During a raid of a village one day he spared the life of a human child. By sparing a life, you are stealing blood from Yeenoghu, so sparing a life was blasphemy, and so his pack turned on him. He was barely able to escape. He left the continent for a new one to avoid being hunted down. He is trying very hard to change his ways and become good, but his frame of reference for what is good and bad is so extreme that even when he thinks he's doing good, it's really just less bad than he's used to. This makes him very naive. Now that he's join an adventuring party, he has fierce loyalty to his friends which he considers his new pack.

These paladins--reasoning that the young goblins had not been damaged by the evil ways of their tribe--raised them as if they were humans, and soon recruited those who accepted the god as squires and pages. He in particular had an extreme fascination for human culture, and above all else, saw their god as a source of incredible inspiration--even considering himself to be human, in adoration of the paladins and their devout culture. At the age of sixteen, he completed his training under the paladins' watch, and officially attained the status of Blessed. Following his graduation, he set off into parts unknown with the intent of delivering ""a great conquest"" for the war-god... all the while insisting he was indeed a priest, and was just as pious as any upstanding human, thank you very much.																						"9/18/2017 10:32:07,Peaches,Goblin,Ranger,"Beedle Grimgulp was found as an abandoned baby by an a group of anarcho-syndicalist Dwarven miners on their way back from an expedition in the Earthspur Mountains. The miners, being brutish men, bickered amongst themselves whether to throw the green mass in the crib into the river, or stab it and move on. However, Beedle’s adopted father, Magnus Grimgulp, felt a stirring within his heart. Even though the Dwarves and Goblins of the Earthspur Mountains had been enemies for centuries, Magnus could not let a wee child simply die through no fault of its own.He convinced his comrades to take the child, and named him “Beedle”, after one of his companions said the baby looked like an overgrown insect. Beedle grew up among his many Dwarven adopted parents and learned to become a miner and tracker, deep within the hills and mountains. Although his true name is Beedle, his adopted community has called him Peaches, as the first word he was able to mutter was not “mama” or “dada”, but “peaches!” when the Dwarves were resting and eating peaches in the woods after a particularly exhausting day in the mines.Recently, during an expedition deep into the bowels of Faerun, his group of miners dug too deep and stumbled upon a demon in its lair. The demon absconded with Peaches’ family and fellow miners, and he has tracked the demon all the way back to the plane of Pandemonium to rescue his loved ones, and exact revenge."9/18/2017 17:07:18,Pio,Goblin,Rogue,"Pio was born as a new crime gang overtook a small city of Rom just south of Unn. Despite the very poor and crime ridden environment, his parent's raised him to the best of their ability and taught him how to defend himself. When money became tight and the family became homeless and lived on the streets, Pio began stealing to help his sick mother stay alive. He would do anything he could to save his mother. When Pio's mother died after being 3 months in critical condition, he fled for the forest, running from his father who had turned to drinking and became abusive. He looked for answers and prayed to Silva. He survived off the wild for 6 years before his first non-animal contact since leaving Rom, a large robot, that seemed to be lost was bulldozing its way through the forest making a huge amount of noise. Pio spoke with the robot and lead it to his shelter, where he began inspecting it and poking and prying. He realized that the robot was sentient and came from the dwarvish town of Jun. Pio and the Large Robot that proclaimed himself as ""The Bulwark"" returned to Rom and began ridding the streets of the gangs and violent thugs. He found his father in the same state as he had saw his mother just before leaving. Pio could barely recognize his dying father covered in dirt on the side of the road. He did everything he could, but to no prevail. After he had lost everything, him and Bulwark travelled to Unn and began a new life, even though he is gone from his home-town, Pio often thinks that it is his fault that his father is dead, and that he hasn't made either of his parents proud and therefore does everything to please their dying wishes of him living, and to honor their memories."9/18/2017 9:33:08,Rorrim,Goliath,Fighter,"Goliath who lived in the mountains.

The winter was hard, the Dragonhold Peak clan wasn't sure they would survive, and knew they wouldn't with the gremlins around, so they were going to leave them to die. The gremlins were willing to kill to survive. Facebreaker, then known as One-of-the-Beat for his love of music, went to the gremlins and negotiated a trade. The gremlins used their explosives to blow up the cliff face, creating a harbor against the elements. In exchange, the clan taught them to hunt and grow food. The winter was tight, but they all survived, and Facebreaker was named for the cliff he caused to be destroyed.

Spear in hand, eyes towards the skies, as if searching for something. When asked what, Mahak only half-smiled, 'Something is out there. Something is wrong out there'. The head of his clan thought such a behavior odd, but allowed Mahak to continue. When word of trouble away from the mountains came to the clan, Mahak half-smiled to himself 'It is time'. With this, grabbed his spear and his pack, and marched off into the night.His family name is not from the line of chiefs, and he has no desire to become chief. His blood-family consist of his Father (Puthok Keeneye), Mother(Louthou Heartweaver), and two Sisters (Mola Proudroar and Goupi Claysmasher) but, as with most Goliath tribes, he was raised by the whole clan--hunting from some, rope making from others, etc. He has had limited interaction with non-Goliaths. He and his father ran into a band of roaming Dwarves once, a group that was seeking passage over the mountain to the valley on the other side.

Dubbed Coldwhisper by his tribe, he is an honor-bound warrior as cold and hard as his homeland.    Guided by a divine vision, Urulo discovered a shrine to Heironeous, a god mostly forgotten in Faerún, on a bleak mountaintop near his tribe’s homeland. He knows not what era this shrine came from, nor who built it; all he knows is that upon finding this shrine, he was struck by a bolt of lightning. Not only did he survive – he was granted divine power. Urulo left his village to live alone at the shrine, earning the name Coldwhisper for how he conversed stoically with Heironeous himself.    Now he serves as an aspiring avatar of this god, who represents honor and courage. A silver lightning bolt adorns Urulo’s shield and a war cry for justice echoes from his lips as he enters the fray. Having come so closely in contact with an actual divine power, Urulo is definitely a strange and aloof individual, whose primary motivation in all things is service to his deity. Goliath culture values fair battle, so valor and honor were instilled in Urulo from birth, but the other values are ones he strives to instill in himself and his companions.    Heironeous’ primary demand for Urulo Ogolakanu: to bring the virtues of justice, bravery, and chivalry back into vogue amidst a lawless and backstabbing world. Visions of a resurgence of Hextor, god of dishonorable battle and chaotic warmongering, motivate Heironeous’ desires for Urulo. A scroll containing the details of Hextor’s predicted rise and the steps to shut him down can be found stored safely at Urulo’s home shrine.    Urulo has been sent to civilization according to the whims of Heironeous, who has promised that fate will bring this Goliath to his rightful place."9/18/2017 12:14:21,Lyra Feldspar,Goliath,Cleric,"Lyra Feldspar, a cleric of Melora, was not always the healer she has become. Once, she was a battlemaiden in her barbarian tribe of the Northern Wilds. She and her husband, Gravehardt, helped lead their warband in many raids over the years, but when he was killed in a battle with the nearby orc tribe, Lyra went mad with rage. When she had killed all that she could, she wept, and fled her tribe, unable to face them with out her beloved. Her life changed once more the first time she crested the mountains near Waterdeep and beheld the sea for the first time. Something in that vast ocean, and in the waves, called to her, and she prayed for the first time to a god she did not know in thanks. Melora heard her prayer of gratitude, and gave Lyra the peace she needed to clear her mind, and Lyra was reborn in the sea goddess's service.

"9/18/2017 12:04:06,Aglath Smartleader,Goliath,Fighter,"Aglath grew up in the mountains with his Goliath tribe. From a very young age, he  trained and competed as a remarkable athlete. During the Goliath festivals, he was always known to win the competitions in his age categories. He began playing the Goliath ball game when he was an adolescent, and he quickly rose to be famous among the various tribes as the greatest athlete of his generation.It wasn't just his physical prowess that made him stand out, but also his cunning and natural intelligence. He could always outthink his opponents in addition to being such a powerful natural athlete. This is what made him so exceptional at the Goliath ball game. He was able to quickly adapt his team's tactics to match up against his opponent's and use his team's natural abilities to their advantage.The year that he came of age, his team won the inter-tribal competition marking them as the greatest players in the ten tribes. But what truly made this unique was that there was an ambassador from the Lord's Alliance at the tournament. Tiamat had recently rose, and the Lord's alliance was desperate to find warriors of any kind that could help beat back the Tyranny of Dragons. This ambassador had come to negotiate with the Goliath tribes and bring back warriors to help them fight.When Aglath talked to this officer, he was convinced that he needed to help the Lord's Alliance defend the realm. He and his team all joined with the Lord's Alliance as an elite unit of Goliaths, and he was chosen as the leader. He and his soldiers quickly rose through the ranks and he became a ranking officer. However, now that Aglath had the opportunity to meet with more diverse people from a wide-ranging set of backgrounds, Aglath realized that he was not as intelligent and cunning as he had always thought. Where he had stood out among the Goliath athletes, here he was merely average. Because of this, Aglath has worked hard to be the best soldier that he can, following orders as perfectly as possible and training as much as possible so that he can excel just like he did as a youth.Recently Aglath has received some strange messages from the Goliath tribes. He hasn't seen them in years, but they speak of something strange happening with the Giants and the Ordning, and Aglath decided that he needed to investigate. When he brought this up with his commanding officers, they told him that they couldn't spare an entire unit, but that they would give him a special assignment to investigate and report back."9/18/2017 8:33:30,Keothi Stormhammer Nalakigo,Goliath,Cleric,"Keothi was born to clan Nalakigo, the warrior-priest faction of the Black Lightning tribe, a group of goliath that make their home among the peaks of the Stormcrest Mountains. Life in the mountains is subject to various challenges, from dangerous creatures to the terrain itself, including dangerous storms from the nearby Lucian Ocean. As a result, the Black Lightning tribe has paid tribute to Kord for as long as the oral histories can remember. The Stormlord values strength and bravery over all else, but requires the responsible use of that strength. Clan Nalakigo ensures the tribe lives up to these ideals. They fight to protect what is theirs from the various other tribes of kobolds and lizardfolk that also live in the mountains, but trade with the humans, elves, and other humanoid races that make their homes in the more hospitable lower elevations nearby.Keothi was raised, like most children in the tribe, to fight, but as a member of clan Nalakigo, she was also thoroughly schooled in Kord's teachings and the healing arts by her father, Ilikan Steadyhand. She earned her name when she was 18, during a kobold raid on the tribe’s main encampment. Keothi held the door to Kord’s temple alone, swinging her warhammer with deadly accuracy, protecting the sick and wounded inside. As she was swarmed, she felt The Stormlord’s power flow through her for the very first time. With a clap of thunder, she threw several kobolds back from the entrance, dead. The head of clan Nalakigo, Uthal Thundercaller, christened Keothi ‘Stormhammer,’ and she became a fully-fledged member of both clan Nalakigo and the Black Lightning tribe. The Black Lightning tribe owns a relic of Kord: Thunder-Forged, a glass blade made of sand struck by lightning and carried by the head of clan Nalakigo. Six years after Keothi earned her name, she was on the boundaries of the village when another raiding party attacked the tribe. When the attack was over, Uthal Thundercaller was found dead next to a charred corpse, and Thunder-Forged was missing. Manneo Stormchaser, Keothi’s brother, was with Uthal at the time, and was nowhere to be found after the battle. His own greataxe was lying next to the burned body. A search of the area around the village ensued for the assassins and thief, but they and the blade were nowhere to be found. With the threat from the nearby lizardfolk and kobolds and the rumors of the new tribe of goliath revenants spreading from the Ashen Gorge to the south, it was deemed too dangerous to send warriors en masse to search for it. Keothi’s mother, Eglath Lightninghand, was elected the new head of clan Nalakigo and rechristened Thundercaller, as per tradition. Manneo Stormchaser was presumed dead, and the tribe resumed normal life. Clan Nalakigo, however, deemed the missing blade and the murder of two of their members a blight on their honor, and the new Thundercaller sent Keothi Stormhammer to find and recover Thunder-Forged and serve justice for her murdered kin."9/18/2017 9:56:12,Uthall Unakalaki,Goliath,Fighter,"The thrill of combat. The shouts of battle. A surge of power. A relationship changed.Soldiers and mercenaries alike caught in an intricate dance of death and carnage. Some peoplejust aren’t very good dancers. I am not one of them. Years of training have made my mindsharp, and my blows deadly.With a single swing of my maul, another foe falls. Perhaps he screamed, I do not know. My mindremained focused on the task at hand. I take in my surroundings. Block left, parry right, swing.Another enemy down. This fight is my dance, and this battlefield my stage.Across the plain I see my brother, as brutish and brutal as always. He is not the most elegantfighter, but he is effective in his work. Hold on… something seems… wrong. His stance is nothow I taught him, nor is it anything I’ve seen him do before. His battleaxe is flailing wildly, thereis a bloodlust in his eyes that I haven’t seen since….Damn, I’ve been hit. I was so focused on my brother, I didn’t even notice the arrow comingtoward me. Another scar, another learned lesson. Swing down, sidestep, uppercut. Two moreout of the way. Two fewer standing between myself and my brother. He needs me. He isn’t inhis right mind. He isn’t following the plan.I start to hear the shouts. Not of the small ones, no. I hear my brother. His words arenonsensical, but his fury is palpable. I can feel it in air, I can smell it on the wind. It’s sickening.Parry, sweep the leg. I’m almost to him now. There are six of them. Hell, two of them aresupposed to be on OUR side. He seems not to care. He barely seems to notice. In one move,all six men fall. I have to stop him. He’s going to get himself killed. This is unacceptable.“Brother… Brother! BROTHER!” I shout to him, he seems not to notice. Three more of our menand four of theirs seem to have put aside their differences to take my brother down. Lungeforward. Block right. Turn. Swing. The small ones will not stop me, and they will not stop mybrother. That is something only I can do.The battleground is calm now. Both armies have retreated, which I suppose means we won. Idid not return with the rest. I need to stay and help my brother. He is not well.He finally stirs. I have a hold of him, I must keep him restrained. “YOU WISH TO CHALLENGEME!?” He forces the words out, almost as though he doesn’t know who I am or where he is. Ittakes all of my might to keep him pinned down. “BROTHER,” I shout at him. It seems to work,the rage is leaving his eyes. He tries to tell me he is okay, but I know better. With a firm grip of him, I force him to his feet. “Look at what you have done,” I command him. I know this will not beeasy for him. It is not meant to be easy. It is meant to help him grow.I can see the horror come upon his face. He did not mean for it to go this far. “Brother,” heasks,” what have I become?” I am unsure of what to say. All I can do is look upon him and hopethat I can be strong enough. Strong enough to stand by him, to help him control his fury, to helphim become the best that he can be. I will not turn away, brother, for I am all you have left."9/18/2017 11:08:46,Koivu,Goliath,Paladin,"History & Background-	Kidnapped by slavers from his mountain home at the age of 3. He knows his home was near a place called Guathak’s Great Leap (a chasm), which is in the mountains in the top left of the Dunlin map. However, he has little idea where his home might be, as the name is not known by non-Goliaths and there are Goliath settlements all along the northern mountains of the eastern big island. -	After a long journey, he slavers sold him to the brutal slave fighting pits of Dirkheim (central island). Dirkheim is a mostly dwarven city made rich by trade in minerals from the adjacent mountains and as the principal port between the central island and the eastern island. Dirkheim is ruled by the oppressive Black Boulder clan, with the aging Dagmar Bloodbeard at its head.-	The fighting pits are also a major source of income for the clan: huge sums are gambled on the outcomes of big fights, and slave owners from across the islands bring their fighters to compete in the hope of collecting a major purse. The clan takes a cut of all transactions. -	The fighting slaves of Dirkheim live together at the bottom of a huge cavern. None of their rudimentary buildings have roofs or ceilings, and guards monitor all activity from a web of walkways above. Supplies and new slaves are dropped in via a system of moving platforms. These are carefully designed to prevent any escapes.-	Koivu was raised by slaves, and taught to fight by slaves. The majority of other slaves are orcs, goblins, hobbits, and dwarves; they were either enslaved after being convicted of a crime by the Black Boulders, or were born in the slave pits. Other races were highly prized as slave fighters, particularly very large humanoids (firbolgs, goliaths), and elves. All sorts of half-breeds between different races have been born in the slave pits.-	There were three other goliaths in the pits when Koivu first arrived, but these all perished shortly thereafter in the infamous ‘Great Moon Bloodbath’ held to honour Dagmar BloodBeard’s 400th birthday.-	The biggest Dirkheim spectacles involved outnumbered bands of elves against some combination of wild beasts, bezerker dwarves and the large humanoid races. This was naturally a great source of irritation for the elven city states of the western island, and had caused several wars in past decades.-	Koivu fought his first arena match at the age of 10. Matches involving children were a popular family outing in Dirkheim, and (normally) involved blunted weapons.-	Black Boulder tradition demanded that the winner scalp the losers, and these trophies were displayed in the Dirkheim gladiator hall alongside each fighter’s biography. Since many of the slaves knew each other well, they also exchanged a lock of hair prior to every fight. The winner was responsible for both preserving the victim’s hair, and taking over the victim’s own stash of locks. Fighters knew their hair collections intimately, and memorised the name and deeds of each lock’s former owner. A lock collection was generally preserved as a carefully woven rope.-	The other thing of great importance to the slaves was their god, Khush, or ‘the chained god’. Almost all of the slaves prayed to Khush each day, begging for easy work, a merciful driver, a chance at freedom, or even a quick and painless death. Worshippers in Dirkheim generally wore a chain of black iron, with a link for each moon they been enslaved.Koivu developed into a skilled fighter. Given his presence, generosity and natural inclination to fairness, he was also very popular among the other slaves. Under the tutelage of Marmok, a priest of Khush, he became a fervent believer in the need to end slavery across Dunlin. "9/18/2017 20:37:46,Koloi Stormcaller,goliath,paladin,"Standing proudy at 7’11”, Koloi Stormcaller is the chieftain of Boroza, the capital city of the Skeijeh (cloud goliaths) in the Teeth of Maduros.  Optimistic and always eager to lend a helping hand to the less fortunate, she is seen as a great positive force in her city.  Though she places great value in the traditions and customs of her people, she also sees the value in innovation, hoping to help bring the Skeijeh into the modern world.  She always tries to be patient and understanding towards others, but, unfortunately, Koloi is ruled by her emotions.  She can only be pushed so much before she will push back.Like most of the Skeijeh, Koloi has grey skin, slightly pointed ears, and icy bluish grey eyes.  Her wispy teal hair is kept back, for the most part, in a loose braid that just barely reaches her waist.  She has a very basic tattoo of five black dots under her left eye, which she received as part of her induction into the Heralds of the Storm King.  All of Koloi's clothes are woven or knitted from the fleece of the cumulobovus bison.  She sports dark brown woven leggings and a deep purple shirt, though these are rarely visible under her armor.  She wears a thin woven ""circlet,"" dyed orange, an azwood wedding band, and two leather-corded necklaces.  The first necklace is a wooden pendant with the holy emblem of Deneth carved into it: a wheel pierced by a lightning bolt.  The second necklace hold five knuckle bones, also carved, but with intricate patterns of leafy branches covered in chains.  She also carries an azwood walking staff, covered in runes and containing a secret compartment at each end.  This staff is very old, and marks her status as chieftain of Boroza.They say that Koloi was marked for greatness from the moment of her birth. Koloi's mother, Kayen, went into labor right as a fierce summer storm hit. The storm raged for 5 days and 5 nights, all while Kayen struggled. On the dawn of the sixth day, a bolt of lightning struck a tree outside of the house right as Koloi was finally born. The storm lifted, and the shamans of Boroza said that this child received the kiss of Deneth, god of storms. Unfortunately, the labor left Kayen in a weakened state, and, when an illness swept through the village a few months later, she became sick and passed away. Rhudan Brohn, Koloi's father, was captain of the Skyguard (the group of warriors in charge of protecting the settlement and keeping peace) at the time, and his duties prevented him from raising his daughter on his own. Therefore, Sana Handag, Boroza’s head priestess and mother of Kayen, helped to raise the girl. Koloi practically grew up in the shrine, and she sees it almost as a second home. She excelled at the different fighting styles at an early age; that, combined with her devotion to serving Deneth primed her for a spot in the Heralds of the Storm King, a division of the Skyguard who devote themselves to the patron god of Boroza.When Koloi was 21, the previous chieftain, Vastur Cloudsinger turned 55, ending his term as chieftain. She was elected into the position, and she was appointed with the name Stormcaller. Finding Vastur to have a wealth of information and experience with the trade and export of goods from his past days as a merchant, she eventually asked him to help manage finance and trade. This involved making the the two-day journey to Clove Town to exchange bovus wool for necessities like metals and wood. Not many people in Boroza were willing to leave, and his aid meant that Koloi would not have to take one week out of every month to make the trek. However, having never been outside of the Teeth before, Koloi found life in the bustling city fascinating. Twice a year, she would take her husband Mhasad (and, eventually, their son Trell) with her, and they would spend an extra day there to catch up in current events and to purchase gifts for family and themselves.Koloi also made a friend in Clove Town: a Halfling woman named Minnie Greycloak.  The goliath chieftain has a fondness for sweets, and, during her first visit to the city, she managed to stumble across Minnie’s bakery.  The two hit it off immediately, and they have been good friends ever since.  Koloi has even knitted her friend a couple of blankets as gifts, though Minnie could almost use it as a tent due to its size.  She would often keep Koloi up to date with the latest news in town, and it was from Minnie that the chieftain learned of the laws and new technologies being developed in Clove Town.  She realized just how isolated the Skeijeh were, and, from time to time, she would wonder if this isolation were hampering her people's growth.Eight years after beginning her role as chieftain, it was discovered that, somehow, someone had been traveling to the azwood grove in the middle of the night, cutting down eighteen of the sacred trees. Koloi had known that something was wrong, for the past three nights, she had frightening dreams of being ripped apart by a beast. She formed a small scouting party, telling no one but her grandmother and her husband, and they took watch that night within the grove, in case the culprits returned.It was not long before a group of men and women appeared, saws and axes at the ready, ready to cut down the azwoods. The warriors confronted these loggers, telling them that they had no right to take what isn't theirs. A fight broke out, but these trespassers underestimated the skills of the Skyguard, and they were quickly slain. Koloi and her team found an encampment about a mile away in a small cave. Stashed there were the azwood logs, as well as a contract between some official named Drukhmoor and the former chieftain, Vastur Cloudsinger.After reviewing the evidence, the Council found the former chieftain guilty of desecration. Stripped of all names and titles, Vastur was Exiled.  During his execution, he claimed that all he had done, he had done for his people.  He said that their way of life was growing stagnant, and that they need to change to adapt to the new world.  His arguments, however, fell on deaf ears, and, with one swift strike of her sword, he was silenced forever.  Koloi now has five of his knuckle bones on a string around her neck. His body was not given a sky burial, as is the custom of the Skeijeh; instead, it was chained to the bottom of a pit and covered with heavy stones, never to reach the skies.An emergency council meeting was called. The azwoods were the source of power feeding the Azure Ward, the barrier responsible for protecting outsiders from entering Boroza.  That power was waning. The people were at a loss; what could they do to fix this?After many arguments (and one cracked table), Koloi proposed that they should try to cultivate the holy trees, in order to increase the barrier's power back to full strength.  There had been rumors of azwood saplings appearing where none existed ever before: one on an island with sandless shores, another in the middle of a sweltering jungle, and the last at the base of a mountain with the face of an elderly man.  According to the old stories, these trees could be sought out, and their cultivation process could be determined.  Some council members thought that this was a foolish task; it could be considered blasphemous if they tried to replicate a gift of the gods.  Others thought that it would not work, because, even if they did manage to grow new azwoods, they may not contain the power that would be required to maintain the Azure Ward.  The journey would be for nothing.Koloi told the Council that, if these actions offended Deneth, he would let her know.  And, if this plan does not work, then they must change their way of life.  Though his actions were reprehensible, the Exiled was right about one thing: they have been all too willing to cut themselves off from the outside world for too long.  There had been an increase in the emigration of young Skyeh from the Teeth.  More and more of their people grow curious of the outside world, a world that they choose not to acknowledge.  This ignorance, Koloi said, will be their downfall.  Koloi offered to take on this task herself, as it was her duty as chieftain to protect her people (and since nearly everyone else was too afraid of the outside world to leave). She appointed two interim chieftains to take care of Boroza in her absence, and, after a few days of preparation, she and the two temporary leaders set off towards Clove Town, so that she could introduce them to the trading contacts.  Head Priestess Sana promised that she would keep in contact with Koloi from time to time, to give her updates on the village and to check in with her.A successful trade contract drawn up, Koloi parted ways with the two chieftains.  She returned to her favorite inn, the one where she always stayed in Clove Town.  During dinner, she struck up a conversation with a sweet little gnome named Wrenn.  Intrigued by his tinkering skills, she offered to introduce him to her husband Mhasad one day, as the two of them would get along wonderfully.  Wrenn seemed delighted, and did not mind that it would be a while before Koloi could do so.  After talking late into the evening, they both finally retired to their separate rooms at the inn.That night, Koloi was attacked by an assassin in her room. The killer was no match for the towering goliath, and, in self-defense, she killed the man. Guards came, and she told them all that had happened. They accepted her story and moved on. However, when morning came, she awoke to no less than ten guards placing her in chains, claiming that she was guilty of murder. When asked who made this claim, they showed her the official warrant, signed by one Ezekiel Drukhmoor.  The Stormcaller felt her rage swell within her, and the last thing she could remember was strangling some poor soldier before a sharp blow to the back of her head knocked her unconscious."9/18/2017 2:21:35,Allora,Grey Elf,Warmage,"	Allora is the daughter of a well-off merchant and his upper-crust bride.

Allora has many fond memories of her time spent traveling with her father as a child, and just as many memories of moments when her mother has been overbearing in their extravagant home in the mountains.	Idris is a high-strung woman with overwhelming expectations and a strong sense of propriety and elitism.  Her marriage to Elan was largely to replenish her family’s dwindling coffers, although Elan worshipped the ground she walked upon.  Allora is their only child, and has been burdened by the heavy weight of her mother’s expectations since birth.  Idris’ preoccupation with high society gossip is only rivaled by her fascination with magic.  When Allora demonstrated magical aptitude, Idris insisted that she attend a college for warmages so that she might use her talents to serve their kingdom. 	Allora was certainly a gifted student of the arcane arts, and her sharp mind made up for her frail frame and relative ineptitude with weapons.  Despite Allora’s talent, Idris’ influence indirectly prevented Allora from serving in the royal military.  While Allora was a student, Idris made a staggering number of donations to the college.  Upon graduation the college was loath to put a cash cow onto the field lest she die in battle and her parents stop donating, and they instead employed Allora as a liaison between the college and the temple of Raygus.  	Allora has served in her position at the temple for many decades now, her position requiring her to perform various odd jobs, including recruitment for the college.  While she has practiced her magic and studied diligently to keep her skills sharp, she has had very little experience using them in combat.  Despite her mother’s disappointment in where her career has led, she is rather proud of representing the warmage college.  Despite her complacency with her career, she has been very driven to learn in her private time, and while many of her studies revolve around the arcane and history, they have also grown in scale to include nature and religion.	Allora’s family on her father’s side largely consists of farmers, and they are all devoted followers of Largus.  Her father instilled his love and reverence of the natural world in his child from an early age.  Allora has spent over a century as a zealous patron of the temple of Largus, and her passion for her god has forged strong connections between Allora and some of the temple staff.  Her cold and critical personality seems to be partially shelved when dealing with like-minded devotees, and many of the priests have found that they can look past her somewhat insufferable personality when she becomes engrossed in her religion. 	Her most reliable ally is Bernard, a favored soul in the service of Largus that hails from the same farming community that her father grew up in.  While Bernard is closer to Allora’s age than her father’s, he developed a steadfast friendship with Elan while he was alive.  After Elan’s passing, Bernard became Allora’s closest confidant.  He has guided her in study and prayer for many years, and Allora has developed a combination of admiration and affection for him.  Bernard has also become fond of Allora, although he does not return her romantic interest.  	Elan was killed by bandits on the road home when Allora was 150.  35 years later, she still feels the ache of her loss every day.  Idris has re-married an aristocrat, and she remains as dominating and withholding as ever.  Very rarely can Allora see her mother without hearing about her disappointment, so she makes it a point to avoid her on a day-to-day basis, though she still feels obligated to remain available to her mother.	Allora lives alone in a modest home and divides most of her time between work and the temple of Largus.  While her home is not overly grand, it is well protected from thieves, as she has a hefty sum of goods and funds from her father’s passing stashed away in a magically-protected, locked trunk hidden under her floor, the door completely unnoticeable beneath a fine rug.  She keeps two different keys to it, the first key tucked away in a tiny pocket with a snap that sits on the inside of her breeches and the second buried beneath a bush behind her home.	Allora has left her hometown several times to perform duties for the temple of Raygus or the college, but always returns to her relatively mundane life.  It is hard to say whether that is because of her affection for Bernard, her place in the temple of Largus, or her sense of duty to the college and her mother.   "9/17/2017 23:49:53,Hazel Tealeaf,Hafling,Rogue,"Hazel was born in the southern region of the world of Yun Ast, which had emerged from a harrowing age known as The Long Dark less than a century ago. Her family grew tea on the slopes of a small mountain, and Hazel learned the art of brewing tea at an early age. When she was five, her family left their tea farm and moved far up north, to the sleepy village of Iremur - and they never told her why. Bitter about leaving a place she loved behind, and never really feeling at home in Iremur, Hazel grew up into a teenager with little respect for the property of others, a distrust of adults, and a plan to go back home; back to the tea farm. She doesn't quite know how to get there, but when her friends set off on an adventure, seeking answers to why monsters now roam the woods in numbers unseen since the Long Dark, she tags along. Adventures are fun and profitable, and if she can save the world while she's building up enough of a fortune to pay her way back to the tea farm, well - that's no bad thing. "9/18/2017 11:43:04,Lykitina,Half Cat folk/ Half Elf,Beastmaster,"LyKitina Adventure LogWell that's my name, I will make it a great one!I guess I should start at the beginning, huh?  Well here it goes.I was found by my parents when I was but a bare kit.  They were heading into town on the main road when they rounded a blind corner and came across the remnants of brigands' ambush.  There was very little other than trash remaining of the 2 wagons that had been attacked.  The wagons themselves had been flipped over and burned.  Everything they carried had been torn, shredded and scattered beyond repair or retrieval.   It was an abandoned battle zone at best.  As they stood there gaping at the proof of the dangers of the road they heard a small cry from below the biggest wagon.  Working together they were able to use their team of horses to right the wagon, despite it's size.  As they did so they saw a flash of light, the final breaking of a protection ward.  As it did so the crying got louder, hey I was hungry!  Needless to say they retrieved me and decided the only thing to do was to bring me home with them.  They didn't have children of their own you see, as their only son had died of Scarlet Fever the winter before.  I was their hope and turned into the child they no longer had.  I have no complaints.  They totally ignored the fact that I was a different race, and did not tolerate anyone around me who had issues with it either.  So all in all, I had a great childhood.  We were not rich in mortal treasures, but everything else was readily available at all times.  That ranged from hugs of encouragement, chores, and blessings.  I grew up on a ranch, at the foothills of the mountains.  We had animals of all types, as we firmly believed that as long as we took care of nature, it would continue to take care of us.Three years ago, I found my own foundling, kind of anyway.  On the way into the City on a trade run, I heard hollers for help ahead of me.  I took off expecting to finally deal with some of the brigands that were known, (personally) to haunt the road.  Turns out I was right and wrong.  It wasn't a brigand, thief or rouge.  It wasn't even gang of them.  It was a Tiger that was attacking the small family.  Now this tiger wasn't exactly fat, but was the largest one I'd ever seen.  She was fierce in her attacks, the family was loud with their screams.  Even when I joined in the attack, she refused to run.  She was that desperate.  Now I may look quite a bit like a cat, but that doesn't mean I condone unethical attacks on anyone.  Not only that, but she was not of my race.  She was just a wild and crazy animal.  I had to put her down for the safety of everyone.  I did so and was thanked repeatedly by the family I rescued as I continued to check out my kill.I was able to find the causes of the attack.  When I passed it on, they too agreed it was a shame to have to kill such a majestic creature in self defense.  First she was injured.  She had a piece of an old trap pierced through her hind foot.  It was old, rusty and very infected.  She could hardly walk, much less hunt for herself.  That was why she had hunted the only prey that couldn't outrun her.  The weaklings on the road.Second and of more immediate concern, she was a nursing mother.  Somewhere there was at least a cub that was not going to get dinner at best, at worst it could become dinner to anything that wanted one without it's mother to defend it against the predators that abounded in the area.  I knew I couldn't let either of those things happen.  I tracked her back to her lair, and found the only cub left of a litter of 3.  They were all skin and bones so there was no doubt about what had killed the other 2.  He was hiding under the bodies of his litter mates, trying to stay warm with their cooling corps.  It was sad.  I managed to coax him out from under the stack with some fresh rabbit that I'd caught while tracking his mama back to him.  He crawled his way out on his belly, barely strong enough to cry and to smart to make enough noise to scare the rabbit away.  I crooned encouragingly to him the entire time.  I made a friend that day.  I named him Lyger as from the beginning he was determined to grow into his appetite.  He never stopped eating and growing for years it seemed.  He is definitely one of the largest of his race I've ever seen.  He has grown rapidly and earns his own keep now by guarding the ranch well.  He has always been a loyal friend to me. I trained him just like the war-cats that protect the nearest village.  He earns his keep, no matter where he goes.  He has been a great friend since I carried him home as well.  I sure needed one too.Together we are leaving in the morning.  I always knew I would be leaving to find my own way around the world.  So did my parents, they are wise about things like that.  That was why they made sure I have the skills I needed to do so.  I know how to cook, I know how to clean.  I know how to mend my gear.  I know how to trade, I know how to talk to others, even though in general I prefer not to.  None of that was hard to learn as I always loved spending time with my parents as they did all of those things routinely.  That is hand on learning that I like the most.I've always had a knack for working with animals especially.  My parents have encouraged me to go and discover the world for myself.  They want me to try and find my people at least.  I am always welcome back, but they are well aware of the fact that the horizon I can't see yet, is where I want to go next.  It is time to start my story.  I promised them it would be a great one, and they promised to read it. _Oracle CurseI was communing with nature again as my teacher kept harping on when I heard screaming coming from over the hill.  I took off and found a small family fighting against a large pack of wolves.  They were not doing well against them at all.  As soon as I showed up  they all turned on me like they had been waiting on me alone.  They totally ignored the others as soon as they could and seemed to get stronger the longer they fought me."9/17/2017 22:43:02,Izzthrae,Half drow,Bard,"Half drow bard.

My story  is one of  bizarre coincidences to be sure.  First off my family’s legacy of a magical bow is mine without any instructions.  I know my elven relatives are quite affronted by my  mother’s temerity in naming me as the bearer of the bow.  I know that it has a long and involved history, even if I don’t know what that is.   It is a family heirloom.  The one obvious thing that it does is magically create it’s own arrows.  I know it glows sometimes but I haven’t decided if it glows around danger or evil, to me or it.  My teacher I think knows more but chooses not to tell me for promises to my parents who were great friends of hers.  I know that she decided to take me on out of friendship for them and I think, regret that she was not there to help when they needed it most.  My parents were well known as hero’s and adventurers even while they  were shunned for being together and even more after I was born.  They didn’t care what their families and friends thought, they belonged together and that was that.  The 2 of them together were a sight to see, you could easily visualize their connection.  When father died at the hands of some undead minions, mother knew right away.   He had been guiding a group into a new settlement area that was supposedly safe.  The only reason mother wasn't with him was because she was working closely with a wizard friend on a secret spell against the undead.  Later, after she finished the research she went after his killers.   Although she took down the undead that killed him, she fell into depression and faded away.  There was nothing I could do to help.  I had to watch her slowly die.  I found out later that the research she completed after father died she paid for literally with her soul.  Once her quest for vengeance was over, she had to pay the price.  That is why I know that the undead killed both my parents.  I have hated and hunted them since.  I still don't know exactly what the spell was that she sold her soul for, she  just said that the success would help me and my children against the undead.  Then she named me as the next bearer of the Family Bow of Infinate Arrows.  Only one member from her family attended her funeral and the only reason he came was to pick up the Bow.  He was furious when he found out that she had passed it on to me in front of witnesses even he couldn't discredit.  He never said a word to me just insisted that upon my death the family had the right to the Bow.  I will pass it on to someone who is worthy, for I know that is what she would have wanted."9/17/2017 18:57:21,Sovan Dareshin,half elf,bard,"As the child of an illicit tryst between a human hunter and an elf from a highly closed and xenophobic forest community, Sovan’s only connection with his elven father was an amulet with a symbol of darkened moon and a letter apologizing for sending him away. He lived in the city with his mother until he was six years old, at which point she died suddenly and tragically, leaving him alone in the world. Sovan was entirely unequipped to fend for himself on the streets, surviving more by luck than skill. He was on the edge of starvation, too faint from hunger even to look for food, when a green dragonborn child approached him in an alley and offered him a sticky bun. Suspicious, but too hungry to say no, he let her approach, and ate the bun.When she realised how desperate he was, the child offered to bring him more food the next day, and over time, Sovan and Fær became close friends. She snuck food to him whenever she could, and protected him when the older urchin children would try to steal from him or beat him up. With Fær’s friendship and protection, Sovan had a fairly happy childhood, despite his circumstances. They played together almost every day, and Sovan made up games for them and sang her songs he invented.When he got a bit older, Sovan eked out a meager living singing at low class taverns. He knew he was talented enough to do better, but no one would take him seriously due to his lack of social connections and generally shabby appearance. He was desperately jealous of more successful bards, especially the well-known and well-loved Tütz Malüts.Sovan’s big break came from a surprising source. When Fær and Sapphira got married, Sovan’s wedding gift to them was an original song, written in the style of traditional dragonborn love ballads and performed at the wedding in flawless draconic, which he learned for the purpose. Sapphira’s family connections meant that the wedding was overflowing with wealthy dragonborn elite, who were equally charmed by Sovan’s talent and the novelty of a half-elf performing draconic music.From that point on, Sovan’s life improved immeasurably. Sovan became a highly desired performer at high class dragonborn events, and the head of the Bella Cuprica clan (Sapphira’s extremely rich and important family) took credit for “discovering” him and became his patron.A few months later, Sovan decided to write a song about Sapphira and Fær’s honeymoon trip to Silanya. He started researching the new continent, conducting interviews with sailors who worked on the ships that traveled back and forth between the continents. A particularly successful interview resulted in Sovan being invited back to her berth, and a misunderstanding of the ship’s schedule resulted in him oversleeping and still being aboard when the ship cast off for Silanya.During his accidental journey, Sovan forged close friendships with most of the crew, and planned to make a short visit to Sila to see his friends and the town before re-boarding the ship and traveling home with them. However, a massive storm destroyed the ship just before it reached Silanya. Sovan managed to swim to shore on a piece of flotsam, but nearly everyone else drowned, and Sovan was sufficiently traumatized to swear off boats for the foreseeable future.Now that he was trapped in Silanya, Sovan basically thought “Well, I’m here anyway, may as well have an adventure” and joined the guild."9/18/2017 11:01:46,Sydna Dwynmoor,Half Elf,Warlock,"Sydna is a former sister-scholar of an order of Oghma and as such had devoted her life to knowledge and understanding the arcane. In the kingdom where her order resided, a lord and his order of knights demanded the secret knowledge the sisterhood retained regarding neighboring factions. To the angered disappointment of the lord, the sisters refused to get involved and locked away any books or scrolls relevant to what the knights were searching for. Weeks later, on a fall night, Sydna awoke to screams and metal footsteps. The knights had broken into the compound and began ransacking and slaughtering the sisterhood. Sydna ran to her mentors room where she was already ushering in some of the younger sisters into a secret passage. As Sydna was the last to crouch into the passage, her mentor gave her a book of gods before sealing the entrance with her on the other side. Sydna rushed down the passage, as she heard the sounds of swords penetrating flesh echoing behind her. Once she caught up to the few remaining sisters of her order, they exited the passage well outside of the complex but much to their dismay, they turned to see what was once their home ablaze with knights riding about rounding up any survivors. The other sisters decided the best course of action would be to move with the cover of night and head towards a neighboring nation with a known sisterhood of Oghma. Sydna however could not ignore a growing pain and anger in her heart and so she opened her gift from her late mentor and frantically scanned the pages for a suitable god to call upon (as clearly she felt betrayed by Oghma for letting this happen). Her mind felt ashamed but her heart and eyes could not be pulled away from the entry on Shar, The Mistress of the Night and Lady of Loss. She called upon the goddess to smite the knights and lord that had caused her such pain and much to her dismay, the Mistress obliged. Sydna only remembers through her tears and sobs, a dark figure approaching her, wiping the drops off her face and asking ""do you promise to serve me? To seek vengeance against all who oppose me?"" And in her heart she replied yes. Shar entered Sydna then and began to lay waste to the remaining knights who had not returned to their castle, silent as a shadow and deadly as a storm. At dawn, Sydna awoke in the rubble of her fallen order, charred bodies she recognized and mutilated armored bodies she did not, lay about her in the destruction. Looking over her body, with new power coursing through her veins, she recognized Infernal script written all about her torso and upper arms. They state repeatedly ""I serve the night mother, I wield the shadow weave, and I will have my vengeance"". Looking out past the destruction, once again she saw the shadowy cloaked woman, but this time a large armor clad devil stood beside her. The devils form dissipated into shadowy smoke with hellfire burning throughout and rushed through Sydnas body. ""You are now bound in service to me, you will offer your accomplishments to me, and seek out the Order of the Dark Moon for greater truth and power"" spoke the lady, at which point she vanished. Sydna searched through the rubble for her mentor and retrieved a necklace to her former patron Oghma, in honor of her past. As she lit ceremonial incense for safe passing of her mentors soul, her body began to burn into black smoke. Sydna does not know if her mentors spirit passed on to Oghma through her ceremonial rites, or if she had damned her to servitude to Shar, but as such Sydna now offers souls to the god that she once knew, and the goddess she's now bound to and let's the dead settle their disputes. With no where to go nor anyone to turn to (as Sydna knows nothing of her past other than she was an orphan who was taken in by the sisterhood) she ventured out in hopes of finding the Order of the Dark Moon to obtain enough power to destroy the kingdom that wronged her and took away the only family she knew."9/18/2017 11:52:09,Sascha Treeburn,Half Elf,Fighter/sorceror,"Memoirs (SASCHA TREEBURN )I figured I'd better start writing down my story or no one would ever believe me when I get older, not even me.  I guess I should start at the beginning.  My name is Sascha Treeburn and I am a fighter primarily.  I also discovered that I have a small talent for magic as well.  My village was destroyed when I was a toddler but I was rescued by the Forrest Witch that lived nearby.  She said that the animals came crying to her saying that the evil one had come to destroy the peaceful village that legend said a defiant one would arise from that would be his undoing.  To keep this from happening he sent an entire army to utterly destroy the village and every man, woman and child in it.  He has a reward out for the head's of all who were from there as well.  Me, he does not know of as everyone believes me to be the bastard daughter of the witch and a spell entranced knight.  That lie was spread for my safety.  I do not believe I am the one foreseen to cause his destruction, but I will take him down given half a chance.  His name is Nikeal Angrenian and after all he has done he deserves to die and I hope I can help him on his journey to hell.  My mother, yes mother for she has raised me, told me I needed to go and find my niche for myself. ""I have traveled long and far to find my home, the spot that is my own.  The journey was only as important as the knowledge gained from it.  This is the home I found, the life I chose, now you must do the same.""   Then she went to an old, ancient tree and said a spell or perhaps a prayer of some sort, the tree started to burn with a strange, magic fire and then it was consumed from the flames and in it's place was an ordinary looking bag.  She picked it up and opened it.  She put her whole arm in it and pulled out a round object, kinda the shape of a plate w/o the center.  It has a reddish tinge to it.  Even then I could tell there was something special about it.  ""This is from my family, it is a chakram of fire and has saved me many times.  You are the true daughter of my heart if not my body.  To you I give this and a small bag of holding stocked with what you need to start your journey.  It is the same thing which my mother gave me and one day you will pass it on to your child.  When the time comes and your journey ends it will once again become the tree of burning for disguise and protection.  So walk this world with pride and no regrets Sascha TreeBurn, it is waiting for you to make your changes.  Do not waste your time or attention on fools or idiots, save it for those who are worthy, judge not from appearance but from heart which is where true treasure lies.”Since then I have traveled far and learned alot.  I have discovered that I have within me the ability to do magic.  I am learning more every day.  I have learned and earned a familiar, his name is Copper and he is a weasel.  His mere presence makes me feel stronger.  I can see thru his eyes as if we are one.  I can read his emotions, what there is of them.  The more he is around the stronger our bond is.   Copper’s personality is becoming more defined as time goes on as well.  I am trying to teach him to detect traps, magical items, and gems.  He is figuring it out more and more.  He is very mischeivous as well as curious.  He is always finding something interesting and bringing it back to me.  A couple of times he has brought me jewelry he obviously just dug up.  Nothing magical unfortunately but worth something when I cleaned it up and sold it as costume jewelry.I found  ”FlameHeart” a greater sword of Fire, this is the sword that I carry now.  Of course, I carry my family Chakram of Fire as well as a long bow.  The spells I have learned are few, but very useful.  I’ve picked up a few other things as well.It was weird I could have sworn I was sitting at camp, getting ready to roll up in my bedroll and then with out any warning I was standing in a road in a field.  There were 2 others there, the one I recognized was one-twoly, a large human.  The other was someone I’d never seen before, a dwarf who introduced himself as Da Morgan, he appears to be a cleric.  We decided to head towards the mountain in the distance.  It took all day but we found a cave entrance and decided to do some exploring.  We went down the passage and came across a large room that looked like a temple.  In the center there was a shield and a hammer. one-twoly picked up the shield and it transformed to look like a pair of  bracers.  No one could lift the hammer and so we left it.  We found three boxes on a shelf in the back of the alter.  We each took one and opened them.  Mine had a copper headband that I decided to wear.  I put the box in my bag and continued to look for further treasure.  Copper found a hidden passageway and there was an alchemist’s lab at the end of it.  There was a shelf of extremely rare spell componets that I took all of and another of potions that I stocked up on.  We found another room that was full all kinds of things.  I found a magical elven thin blade, some boots, a set of bracers, 2 bracelets, a necklace and 8 rings to wear.  I put a bunch of other stuff in my bag.  I keep seeing the same design on all of this stuff and I think it is a forge mark of some kind, this stuff looks like masterwork quality stuff.  Copper found enough bracelets to entirely cover his body.  He looks kinda cute, like a weasel ready for battle.  The guys got weapons that actually talk to them.  My sword doesn’t talk, at least it hasn’t yet.  Copper led us to another room that had a bunch of switches in it.  We finally got them turned to the right combo and 4 doors opened off another big room.  We decided to take a break before when any further.  There was nothing else of interest in the caves.  It took awhile but we made it to town and each decided that even though it had been profitable, it was time to make our own way.  "9/18/2017 8:28:09,Brinyold Seraphina von Fevr'ton III,Half Elf,Fighter (Gunslinger)," Born the third child, and first son of Seraphina and Brinyold Fev’rton (II), Brinyold found much of his life planned out for him from the very beginning. His parents were the front-runners of what had quickly become a household name. Using their combined knowledge of craft and magic, they specialised in producing many enchanted goods for common folk, introducing a little bit of magic into the household lives of those that would probably never see it otherwise, aiming to make general living and labour just a touch easier, and more interesting. With his wife’s encouragement, they also branched out to creating armour, which also boomed, becoming a well-known name for many militia, and many soldiers can boast that their lives were saved by the plate mail bearing the Fevr’ton family crest. However, the happy couple has both agreed to never use their company resources for any objects that may be used in battle, a fact that Seraphina told her first son many times over. Brinyold was raised to be the heir of such a company. A large task, considering its booming popularity. He looked up to his two older sisters, Lilith and Dimetra, and though he believed that either one of them would be better suited to the task, the role was given to him. His father was a kind man, but rather old fashioned in his views, believing that a male heir would benefit the company more.  So, Brinyold was kept indoors to study, while he watched his sisters longingly, watching them both become people he admired greatly, and had a strong relationship with. He was close to his parents, and took to his studies without complaint, realising that a person who feels sick at the thought of going outside and getting muddy has no place in the adventuring lifestyle that his siblings had found themselves in. So he stuck to it, growing into a fine young man that friends of the company admired and saw much potential in, despite seeing him so rarely. On the cusp of adulthood, however, his mother fell ill. An illness that not even the most divine clerics could identify, and sadly, she succumbed to it, dying in her sleep surrounded by family. Brinyold and his sisters, now older and in their own positions of power (Lilith a respected arch mage, and Dimetra the head of militia, both situated in one of the largest cities on the continent), mourned the loss of their mother, a who was a kind and understanding women that all three had a close bond to. Their father, however, had taken a cold turn. Not long after the passing of their mother, and almost immediately after Brinyold’s sisters returned to their city, he had found himself a new spouse. A fellow Moon Elf, Aravae. Within the span of just under a year, they had married, and had their first child; a full Elven blooded son, which threw Brinyold’s life into a spiral. Addressed with a cold demeanour, the news was broken to Brinyold that a full elven heir would be a far better suitor for head of the family name. So in a flash, Brinyold’s rights were revoked, handed to a half-brother that Brinyold had never bothered to remember the name of.Harbouring a resentment towards his new step mother, and a sense of betrayal towards his father, Brinyold took his first independent step. He decided to leave. …Or, he tried to. It took many attempts to gather the courage to go outside, so he started small. A trip into the garden, a walk through the marketplace. Eventually he built himself up enough courage to be able to go outside without too much of an issue. Touching people without his gloves was still out of the question, and dirt of his boots still caused discomfort, but it was as good as it was going to get. This delay worked in his favour, however. Despite his mother’s promises, Brinyold heard via trusted servants that Aravae had plans to change the company. They would start building weapons, and that plans for new, deadlier weapons were in progress. Wanting the Fevr’ton name to have no part in this bloodshed, for his mother’s sake, he started planning.He played it casual. Now that he was no longer heir, he had nothing stopping him from going on his own travels, as he put it, though there were many who questioned if he had what it took, including Brinyold himself. But nevertheless, after a number of attempts, he found himself working up enough courage to pack what he needed, and set out on his own, out of the city. But, not before running one last errand. He made a trip into the city’s slums, and eventually, into its’ crime circle, and, despite the ridicule, he was able to find the man he needed for the job. He hired a rogue, famous for his silence and quick hands, and ordered him to steal these weapon blueprints, replacing them with altered copies. At first glance, they appeared the same, but the calculations on the forgery were nonsense. The rogue returned to Brinyold the next night, blueprints in hand. He paid the rogue handsomely for a job very well done, and set out of the city, hiring a carriage to take him to the nearest town. Blueprints in hand, and Aravae’s plans to change the company taken back a few notches, he set out on his journey. Arriving in the next town, it clicked now how widespread his family’s name was. Armed with just his belongings, weapon blueprints, and a silver tongue, he realised that the Fevr’ton name was rather well known, and he felt a melancholy feeling in his heart whenever he saw the family crest on items his mother had a hand in creating. Determined to make good use of this head start he’d given himself, he got to work. Using his family name, he gained access to many a library and laboratory in this new town, studying these blueprints intensely and tinkering when he could. Progress was slow, initially, but after a while, he found himself passionate about the craft. Oil on his hands no longer made him sick, and it clicked that he only felt this way about things that he loved dearly and was passionate about, things he no longer saw as gross. Before now, that honour was only held by his sisters and mother. But once he stopped being afraid to get his hands a little oily, progress quickened, and before long, he was able to fill in the blanks of this blueprint, creating the first firearm. However, making it proved to be the easy part. Making it /functional/ took far longer, but after many months of challenging work, experimenting with triggers, and ammunition, he finally did it, putting a smoking hole in a barrel a good foot lower than the bottle he was aiming for. Even with this success, he kept working. Figuring out the fastest ways to reload, how to keep the hand steady when firing, the best stance to take, and so forth. He kept his creations a secret, as if word of a weapon like this found the ears of his family back home, there would be hell to pay. He’d created the first firearm, and had a head start, but this head start was short lived. While he continued to create, and experiment, word reached this town of new, dangerous weapons being distributed by the Fevr’tons. The production of such weapons was set back, sure, but having many experts on tinkering at their disposal, it didn’t take them long to overcome the hurdle Brinyold had set for them. He still had a head start though, and Brinyold planned on utilising it. He still had a weapon unique to him, and he aimed to use it to take back the company that’s rightfully his, and bring it back to the peaceful glory that his mother had envisioned for it."9/18/2017 7:26:35,Hammer Lulach,Half Orc,Cleric,"Soldier, ex-Flaming Fist Mercenary, Warpriest of Tempus"9/18/2017 9:28:34,Ruke,Half Orc,Barbarian,He's a half orc mercenary captain that loves to paint.9/18/2017 9:28:20,Olgar the Gourmand,Half Orc,Warlock,A trained chef turned warlock after unknowingly forming a pact with a demon of gluttony.

Derek never knew his father, and lived on the streets as no one wished to take in the obviously tainted child as his tail and scales marked him as and outsider in the closed community of elves.His own natural talents with magic manifested themselves early and he ended up in the care of an elderly mage and then passed off to one of the mages fellows who took the child on adventures and taught him the ways of sorcery as it came naturally to him since Magic quite literally resided in his blood. Eventually Derek returned him as a youth and spent no time at all getting into trouble with the locals and making a nuisance of himself with his friend and often times lover, Lyandria."9/18/2017 13:03:50,Alunira Nenlaer,Half-drow,Bard,"Born to Joscelina Nenlaer, the favorite daughter of the prominent Waterdhavian merchant Markus Nenlaer, Alunira’s childhood was quite different from that of other children in merchant Houses.  Her mother had developed rebellious tendencies in her early teens, coupled with a streak of wanderlust.  This dangerous combination led to Joscelina’s eventual escapades into Downshadow, Waterdeep’s newest “neighborhood.”  Though the magical echoes of Halaster’s Call had faded a century earlier, adventurers were still drawn to the area, and it was there that Joscelina met Anafein Zelith, a drow rogue on the run.Having led a short-lived resistance in his home city, Anafein was betrayed by one of his followers who feared the matron mothers and Lolth’s ire.  Forced to flee, he escaped the Underdark through one of the caverns leading into the depths of Undermountain, and from there made his way upwards through the dungeon’s levels into Downshadow.  Joscelina took more than a passing interest in the dashing, handsome drow, and visited him with an increasing frequency over the next year.  Slowly, the relationship between the couple grew more intimate, though Joscelina had to hide it from her family.Joscelina and Anafein’s relationship came to an abrupt halt when Anafein was arrested by the Watch and accused of the attempted murder of Dagult “Dagger” Neverember, the current Open Lord of Waterdeep.  Though Anafein was innocent of the charges against him, he was brought to trial and found guilty.  The Lords of Waterdeep needed a scapegoat to punish for the crime, and the public execution which followed the trial served to reassure the city’s citizens and show that the murderer had been brought to justice.  When the news of Anafein’s tragic death was brought to Joscelina, she fell insensible to the floor in her family’s North Ward home.  Though Markus paid for the finest of healers from all the temples of Waterdeep, none could rouse his daughter from her coma.  The healers did, however, give Markus some surprising news: Joscelina was pregnant.Five months to the day after Anafein’s unfortunate demise, while the worst hurricane in Waterdeep’s living history raged up and down the Sword Coast, Alunira Nenlaer was brought screaming into the world.  Though Markus had hired the best midwives to be found in the city, they were unable to stop Joscelina’s bleeding, and later that evening she passed away.  Though Alunira showed signs of her half-drow heritage such as her slightly pointed ears and dark skin, she was Markus’ only solace in his grief over the death of his daughter.  As she grew older, her grandfather continued dote on her and swore to raise her in a manner befitting House Nenlaer.As Alunira was teased and bullied by the other children of the merchant houses of Waterdeep, she spent most of her time with her tutors or otherwise absorbed in her lessons.  In particular, Alunira showed great promise with her studies in history, religion, languages, swordplay, and especially music.  By the time she reached ten years of age, she could play the lute, lyre, mandolin, harp, and flute as well as compose poems and ballads.On the occasion of Alunira’s sixteenth naming day, Markus announced that Alunira was to travel with House Nenlaer’s merchant caravans, following their usual route south along the Trade Way to Baldur’s Gate and then east to Suzail in Cormyr.  Though she didn’t realize it, this was Markus’ way of testing Alunira to see if she was ready to start controlling a stake in House Nenlaer’s trade business.  At first she enjoyed leaving Waterdeep and seeing some of the great cities of Faerun, but by the time the caravans reached the Dragon Coast, she was bored with the slow pace and distinct lack of excitement.Prompted by a sudden need for adventure that she had never felt before, Alunira decided one night to steal the money that the caravan had acquired.  From there she stowed away on a ship leaving from Bolliver’s Wharf in Suzail, with grand plans to see the entirety of the Sea of Fallen Stars.  However, this dream was cut short when the ship was boarded by pirates from Mirg Isle, one of the many rocky islands that comprise the Pirate Islands.  Exposed as a stowaway, Alunira managed to convince the pirates that they would be better off if she joined them, rather than killing her.Alunira spent several years working her way up the ranks and eventually became Captain of the Dark Desire.  However, many of her crew disagreed with her methods and found her to be too kind-hearted for a life a piracy.  After being caught letting Officer Ryl Obarin of the Cormyrian Navy go free instead of killing him or holding him for ransom, the crew of the Dark Desire mutinied against Alunira and threw her overboard.  She has since washed up on the shores of Suzail, penniless and missing Black Bellamy, her parrot familiar."9/18/2017 12:06:06,Bazil,Half-Dwarf / Half-Ogre,Brawler,"Bazil never knew his Ogre mother, being raised by his Dwarven father withheld from the rest of the clan.

They raided the settlement, and burnt a large section of the forest. Jamenas was taken, and imprisoned in a fire cult cell. Jamenas, desperate for vengeance, pleaded to the gods. One minor god, though not minor compared to mortals, answered his pleas. Hoar, the god of vengeance, had a new champion! Jamenas escaped, slaying any cultist he found, until he reached the outside world. Thirsty for vengeance, Jamenas adventures, calling on both his druidic magic, and the power of Hoar, to quench his thirst!"9/18/2017 12:22:35,Allister,Half-Elf,Sorcerer,"Allister is the youngest of three siblings born into poverty. Their mother was a prostitute, and their father an unnamed elf. After their mother was killed by guards, they had to turn to crime to survive, stealing from peasants and guardsmen. After years of barely surviving, they moved into a church as helpers to leave the dangers of street life. But Allister came home one day to find their church on fire and his older brother wielding strange magical powers, standing over the corpse of the priest who took them in. His sister, Emeline, was battling him, also wielding strange sorcery. At that time, Allister felt a pull within him as his own latent powers awakened, and the resulting magical explosion teleported him outside the city's walls, ready to begin a new life as an adventurer. Allister has since become a fire magic specialist, prone to laughing incontrollably as he sets his enemies on fire."9/18/2017 19:01:39,Jon daWarlock,Half-Elf,Warlock,"I grew up as an orphan living on the streets with no one but my little brother. I was forced to defend and fend for myself and my brother. One day, my brother is stricken ill and resigned to his deathbed. A voice comes to me in the darkness offering help...for a price. I signed a contract in blood, offering my life to this voice in the darkness known as The Great Other to save my brother. However, I did not realize what this truly meant, and I am now forever a servant of this being. The sealing of this pact, while giving me great power, has also changed me, leaving me with blood red eyes, pale white skin, and an overall very creepy looking appearance. I spend my life trying to stay under the radar of The Great Other and preparing for the day, should it occur, that he comes to collect on his contract, I only hope that I can be ready."9/18/2017 13:08:33,Conrad,Half-Elf,Ranger,"Conrad grew up in an isolated village in the northern highlands, where he was a hunter, one of the best archers in the village. However, a clan of orcs moving through the area attacked his patrol party, killing all of the hunters, and they'd thought they'd killed Conrad, too. The orcs' leader, a shamaness with six fingers on one hand, took a trophy from the fight: Conrad's pendant, a family heirloom, left to him by his late mother. Once Conrad recovered he left the highlands and has been tracking the orc with six fingers and her clan ever since, plotting his revenge and searching for his lost pendant.Conrad is sociable and friendly, although he doesn't trust strangers any further than friendly chit-chat. He also doesn't really understand how cities and civilization work, given that most of his life was spent in his tiny village and the huge surrounding wilderness, so he tends to be cautious and a little naive. He's still young, but looks even younger."9/18/2017 20:41:32,Torvald,Half-elf,Sorcerer,"Torvald has been fascinated by magic ever since before he realized he could wield it. If only he could wield it consistently... despite his years of intense study and self-imposed hermitage in the bowels of a swamp (for ambiance, you see) he has a rather poor success rate with casting spells, earning him the title ""Literally The Worst Sorcerer Ever."" He prefers it when his spells fail, rather than backfire though. That time he turned himself into a potted plant in the middle of a battle... not the kind of showing the bards would sing home about. Or at least not in any flattering way. Still, he delves ever deeper into the arcane mysteries, with a particular focus on necromancy... not for any particular reason, he just thinks it's really neat.. or at least that's how it started. He still has yet to attempt anything more complex than Chill Touch... but he just needs to work on his courage... and his luck, apparently. 1's, 1's everywhere..."9/18/2017 13:03:57,Apollo Ramistad,Half-elf,Rogue,"Apollo Ramistad was born into a wealthy family, and grew up fascinated both by the heroes in storybooks of old, and the weaponry they wielded. He spent a considerable amount of his wealth on procuring rare and powerful weapons, and the training to use them. One day while crossing the sea to a new land with his collection in tow, his ship was destroyed by a storm. Apollo narrowly survived, but his collection was lost to the bottom of the sea along with the rest of his wealth. He spent the next few years as a homeless youth, barely surviving by stealing or begging. Eventually he was hired by a group of adventurers to help eradicate a large group of bandits that had essentially taken an entire town over. Now, utilizing the sword skills he learned early in his life, and the knack for thievery and stealth that he picked up as a street urchin, he fights to protect the innocent from whatever threatens them, whilst hopefully making a nice chunk of change for his troubles."9/18/2017 16:25:09,Kirian Ylestos,Half-Elf,Rogue,"Kirian's family never had much money. His Father worked an unsuccessful butcher shop and his Mother  was the daughter of a traveling Elven merchant who thought the relationship pointless, as his daughter would greatly outlive her husband. His mother and father tended the butcher shop and Kirian helped out from time to time though most of his time was spent training like his Grandfather taught him, with the arch-mages gone he figured that someone or something was going to try their luck against the Citizens of Rointor. But he was trained as a rogue, not a guard. His Grandfather, estranged but not unloving, would occasionally visit Kirian and teach him the way of stealth and daggers. Kirian would have lived his life as a petty thief who stole loaves of bread for a living if it weren't for the wisdom of his Grandfather. He applied to join the guard but failed so he would follow the guards undetected under cover of night and help them out in crisis situations. When Rointor's arch-mages disappeared, he made it his mission to help his kingdom in anyway he can."9/18/2017 9:58:45,Maeve'aria,Half-Elf,Warlock,"Maeve is the child of a small noble and a peasant woman who was given an education and a job in his court where she dealt with matters of trade and disputes that related to it.Being exposed to this environment from an early age has left her a bit warped morally; she only considers the needs of her close ones and not the world as a whole. When told the story of the boy who cried wolf, the moral she took away was to never tell the same lie twice. She always looks for what benefits her and her friends in a deal and is willing to step outside of the regular social conventions to obtain this.The one person she always looks out for is her mother who instilled  a lot of better natures and taught her the ways of using words and not violence to get her way.Maeve has always had a fascination with the arcane, always wishing to inspect even the most mundane magical items  to understand how they worked and even to maybe one day use magic itself to improve her life and that of her town."9/18/2017 10:11:02,Theren Jassan,Half-Elf,Fighter,"Born to an Elvish woman and a Calishite human man, Theren was raised in Calimshan, on the southwestern corner of Faerun. When his mother was called back to her people, his father never truly recovered from the loss. With an absent mother and a negligent father, Theren fell in with criminal elements of Calimshan, mostly working as a lieutenant's lieutenant. He never stayed with one organization for too long but always earned a reputation for professionalism and dedication to the group, a professionalism that often landed him in jail when others would turn on him while he refused to. After working for -- and against -- a few magic-geared organizations, Theren developed a general dislike for wizards, warlocks, and sorcerers. He thinks them soft and arrogant. Tiring of life in the southwest, Theren set out for adventure, making ends meet as a freelancer and as a bounty hunter, the latter of which he had taken a liking to. He finds the long hours of tracking and thinking through a target's mindset relaxing and rewarding. Given his predisposition against wizards and the like, he's begun to specialize in hunting rogue wizards and the like. (Or just spellcasters someone doesn't particularly like.)"9/18/2017 16:48:11,Kallan Fen,Half-Elf,Druid,"Abandoned as an infant near a secluded druidic wetland, Kallan was raised aware she had a mysterious origin. As she grew, the water druids shared with her their knowledge. She struggled, however, to grasp the wonders of divine elemental power.As all members of this coven, she was assessed as she came of age. When asked to produce a jet of clean water, from her hands poured an enormous cone of searing fire. It was no simple mistake. It had felt oddly... natural. Strangely right.She mastered the different elements in time, but Kallan has never forgotten her very public shame. Neither has the leader of the tribe, Fen Astrid, an ancient crone who tasks her underlings with contributions to their society. Kallan must return to the wetlands once a season to report on what she has seen, to keep Fen Astrid apprised of the outside world's increasing horrors.Kallan knows how blatantly Fen Astrid has set her up to fail. Alone, uninformed, lucky and naïve, Kallan can't help but wonder if her leader hopes she will uncover her shrouded past and dissolve into it, for good or for death. For now, the only knowledge she has uncovered is a connection to an extinct, disgraced bloodline of wealthy scientists..."9/18/2017 20:33:17,W.T. Sherman,Half-Elf,Sorcerer,"After his magical powers manifested with destruction and tragedy at a young age, W.T. has been wandering as an outcast for as long as he can remember. At first surviving off what he could beg or steal, he eventually became adept enough as a hunter and forester to earn a meager living while traveling from place to place. Never staying long, he has a special bond with the wild wolves of the forest, who took him in and treated him as a member of the pack in his early years of self imposed exile.Though his life has stabilized with a regular, but meager living, W.T. still fears the lack of control he has over the magic inside him. It has come in handy for self defense from time to time in the lawless wilderness, but it's unpredictability and power is frightening. As he wanders from place to place, avoiding companionship for fear of hurting anyone who would befriend him, he is haunted by visions of a coming cataclysm. Further haunting him is the feeling that he himself could be the cause.With these worries churning in his mind he wanders, in search of control, in search of peace, away from the civilization that he could be a danger to."9/18/2017 7:44:27,John Doe,Half-elf,Sorcerer,"John Doe took his second first breath eleven months ago. His life, his memories, even his name… they were all gone. All he knows is that he woke up one day, alone in a dead town, after crossing to the other side and seeing the horrors beyond.He was alive. He was alone. And a strange power pulsed through his veins.John Doe was completely isolated from all other living things for the first month of his life. Surviving on leftover rations in the town, John simply existed in the face of his amnesia.On his thirty-seventh day of life, John encountered a small dog in the woods. Elated and hopeful, he tried to care for it… but all he found was that his touch killed the animal. He hid himself from anything that moved for weeks after that. He tried to grow his own food, but the plants wilted in his garden. He tried to build a home, but the wood rotted in his hands.Only after he realized the connection between the death and decay he caused and the pulsing power inside him did he understand what he was: a sorcerer, imbued with deadly power. Was he like this before? Or did this power come to him when he died? John didn’t know; he may never know. But John worked with what he had, and slowly but surely he developed his power."9/18/2017 7:57:43,Arthur,Half-Elf,Druid,"Arthur is a half-elf raised by his elven mother - his father, a human bard, abandoned the family when he was young. Arthur never really fit into elven society and never had a very good relationship with his mother - so when he came of age, he joined a nearby circle of druids. This had the advantage of being an honorable occupation that meant he didn't have to talk to people very much. A few years after gaining his own circle, he joined an adventuring party that was warring against Tehevol - a powerful warlord who was using unholy magic to create hideous abominations that mocked the beauty and power of nature. Along the way he met Avenquith, another half-elf druid, and despite some initial differences they eventually fell in love while disguised in wildshape to spy on their enemies. Neither of them had much experience with romance, and the members of their party were amused enough by them to pretend not to notice them sneaking off together during their journey through Tehevol's territory. It turned out they needed all the joy they could get. Arthur was killed in the last battle against Tehevol but Avenquith brought him to the temple of the god of light to have him resurrected. Returning to the Material Plane to be with his love, Arthur and Avenquith settled down together to rebuild the land Tehevol had left scarred and broken - and to rebuild their family.

He felt the sting of her addiction acutely, and began selling himself to try to fend for both of them. He couldn't continue to support them both, and he moved out on his own. He lived as a prostitute (fairly poor, but not on the streets) in Arumis for several years, before he was hired by a wizard. The wizard, a follower of Graz'zt. attempted to sacrifice him to a demon after drugging him. However, the wizard actually summonedNathair Sgiathach, a fey creature, not a demon, and as such he did notuse the correct binding symbols. Nathair killed him, and was going tokill Kal, before he talked his way out of it. After failing to trick Nathair, hedecided that Kal was charming (and vaugely adorable), and they talkedthrough the night. Eventually, they agreed to a pact- Kal would performa grand trick in Nathair's name once every three years, and in return wouldrecieve a portion of his powers. His first prank, burning down a building, resulted in the near death of an innocent family- this caught the attention of his Onyx circle member mentor, who took him in in an attempt to regulate his pranks and teach him to be a warlock proper. They recognized his great potential, and want to help him manipulate his pact to the best of his ability"9/18/2017 5:52:13,Ulric Wolfman,Half-Elf,Sorcerer / Warlock,"Ulric Wolfson  - BackstoryOrphaned at a young age, Ulric found himself surviving on the streets of Lukil with no knowledge of his parents or his past. He stole to survive on the rough streets. Being a half-elf meant that he had to fend for himself. The gangs of the streets didn’t want anything to do with him. One day, down on his luck he tried to rob a dwarf. The dwarf was a cleric by the name of Griff. Griff took the child on as one of his own and taught him to read, write and navigate.  Griff’s family cared for Ulric and he repayed them by working hard. He ended up being a sailor in the navy.Six months ago, he returned to Dalfor in Eastport and has learned of Griffs death. Realising that he doesn’t have the adequate skills to avenge his father he went to a secluded cave near Highview that Griff had showed him in his youth. He had been told that it was a source of power and that when he wanted to learn the truth, he should come here. He began to meditate. Three months later, he began to feel that a presence was watching him. After a further month, he heard a voice calling his name.“Ulric, child of my blood, why do you torment yourself?” a deep resonating voice boomed.Ulric opened his eyes to see an ominous fire dragon standing before him. He croaked the only word that he thought of “Power” he replied.The fire dragon made a noise that sounded like cannons and explosions, Ulric was dimly aware that the dragon was laughing. The noise ran shivers through his spine.“That, my child, is easy, but I will help you along” The fire dragon pushed one claw towards Ulrics head. To his credit, he didn’t flinch. Something awoke within Ulric, the power of a Draconic Sorcerer.  His skin tingled with raw energy. He could feel the anger and rage swell in pure power. For a further month he trained, honing his craft and then left the cave. He has now made his way to Vakrie, where, using his last few coins he has managed to gain transport with a caravan to Nashwall.He looks towards his destination and vows to make anyone involved in Griff’s death pay for what they’ve done."9/18/2017 13:04:50,Bree Ravena,Half-elf,Wizard/rogue,"The dark-haired woman stared down into the cradle, pursing her lips. She glanced at the man next to her, and then lifted the glass lamp further aloft. The sudden blaze of light fully illuminated the features of the infant they both regarded, and the woman slowly shook her head.“It’s slight, but noticeable. We’ll have it done in her fifth year so we can be certain it takes.”The girl applied a final bit of pigment over her cheekbones and dropped the cosmetic palette into her bag. She looked nervously at her reflection in the hand mirror, feeling the woman’s eyes boring into her back. Squaring her shoulders, she turned to face the spymaster with her head held high. She knew that she had gotten the disguise perfect this time.As the woman’s eyes traveled ever so slowly over the girl’s form, the girl’s confidence wilted. The spymaster could find even the tiniest flaw in a disguise, or so the others whispered. Bridget didn’t want to have to repeat the false identity lessons for a third time. Having to do them a second had been humiliating enough, and her cheeks flushed with the remembrance.	“You need to blend a darker tone along the scar tissue to make it unnoticeable, even in bright light. Otherwise, it’s acceptable.” 	Bridget could hardly believe her (admittedly, scarred) ears. That had almost sounded like praise coming from the spymaster. She bowed to the woman, gathered her bag, and practically ran from the room. The rest of the Ravena trainees wouldn’t believe it, but she had to tell them anyway.	The girl rummaged through the drawers of an ancient oak desk, sorting through scraps of parchment. None of the documents held any information pertaining to the royal family at all, let alone intelligence on the suspected assassination. Bridget frowned to herself but kept hunting, looking for anything that could be of use for House Ravena.	After another few minutes, the sound of footsteps approaching the office warned Bridget to hastily rearrange the jumble of notes. Reaching into her belt pouch, she crumbled a bit of hardened sap between her fingers and faded out of sight just as the door opened.	Bridget appeared again in the alley behind the warehouse, then strolled casually out onto the main merchant promenade of Vercentis. After a little distance she stooped down to retie one of her boots, her hands moving almost imperceptibly beneath her cloak. Straightening, she glanced down at the hidden glyph she had created on the cobblestone, then sauntered away. Her assignment was complete, and she had a caravan to catch."9/18/2017 11:18:29,"Jimothy ""Jimmy"" Gershwin-Fisher",Half-elf,Wizard/rogue,"Jimmy is the illegitimate son of an unknown-to-him elf woman and the human Harvey Gershwin, an entrepeneur. While Harvey was away on a business trip, he and a noble elf woman had a bit too much to drink and things got steamy. Upon his birth, the elf woman told Harvey that the child would either be left in the woods to die (lest she bring great dishonor upon her house) or Harvey could come collect him and raise him as his own. Harvey and his wife, Elena Fisher-Mitsubishi were unable to conceive, so they took his bastard son in.Jimmy was basically raised by his goblin nanny Girbna. She taught him to speak goblin at a young age. Every morning Girbna would sit Jimmy down and look him in the eyes and say, “you is kind, you is smart, you is important.” The help at the family estate all wear a steel collar with the family crest. The collar is enchanted and makes the wearer loyal and subservient.Being the result of an affair, Elena resented Jimmy. To add insult to injury, Jimmy is the heir to the Fisher Forges Company. Elena’s father, Chadsworth Fisher, sold majority shares of the company to Harvey so Harvey can choose who gets the company after he retires. Harvey was always away on business trips, so he didn’t really spend too much time with Jimmy. The only time all three of them were together was on holidays and the rare family vacation.Jimmy grew up in luxury and believed he wanted to continue living this way. The expectation was that he would take over the company when the time was right. He attended University of Norseheim where he majored in marketing and business administration, with a minor in goblin studies (he got a 5 on the AP Goblin test so a minor was just four more credits and he figured might as well). It took him 5 years to finish because he kept taking electives in the arts, particularly theatre and dance. He participated in yearly service trips to build homes for underprivileged goblins in the east, was a brother of Phi Alpha Gamma, and student body president his senior year.  Whlie in college he learned forgery and sold fake IDs to his fellow students. While scavenging for supplies one day, he found a book that refused to hold ink, which he used to inspire confidence in his clients, having them believe that their criminal transaction was being kept secret by magic. In reality the book is a lich’s phylactery. His forging skills culminated in being able to forge his own scroll of pedigree and hide the fact that he’s a bastard. He’s not ashamed of being a bastard necessarily, but having something other than a ring to back up his nobility made for a more enjoyable social experience.Jimmy never quite felt like his place was running the family business. He resolved that after college he would leave home to find himself and a place where he belonged. Shortly after leaving Harvey was able to get a message to Jimmy demanding him to return and assume his duty, and if he did not return within a month then he would put a bounty on him."9/18/2017 5:45:26,Prince Quinoa IV of New Ark,Half-Elf,Cleric,"Quinoa was sheltered by both his parents and the Keep staff as a young child in an attempt to keep him focused on training for his eventual role as king. Quinoa's father was  King Bulgur II of New Ark. A tall, thin Sun Elf. Calculating, warlike, protective, and strict. Had a tendency to underestimate his son. Trained Quinoa in courtly arts and customs, though Quin had a difficult time understanding and parsing them. Once he determined Quinoa was too ‘soft’ for traditional combat training, he enrolled Quin in the city’s best clerical seminary. Quinoa didn't have the best relationship with his father, who tended to look down on his son’s more scholarly interests, and upon his father’s death, Quinoa ran away from the Keep.  Quinoa's mother was Queen Chia. Chia was kind to Quinoa and was a calming influence in his life. Chia was deeply devoted to Azuth and instilled a love of reading in Quin - she read him some of his first books. She was also a linguist, and maintained that they spoke Elvish in the keep to keep Quinoa attached to his royal heritage. Unfortunately, Chia died when Quinoa was on the cusp of becoming a teen, and was not there to support him through his unsuccessful military and courtly training. Quinoa spent great lengths of time in the Keep’s extensive library and had read almost all its volumes by the time he came of age. He entered clerical seminary in his late elvish-teens, and only attended for two years before he ran away from New Ark. Due to his protected upbringing, nervous demeanor, and the lack of followers of Azuth at the school (most clerics studying at the seminary followed sun, fire, or water gods), Quin lacked many social skills or commonalities needed to form close bonds with other potential clerics - though he desperately wanted to. Quinoa tried his best, but his tendency to speak at length about his special interests and his penchant for going very quiet and still when he wasn't sure how to proceed in a situation (whether combat-related or societal) tended to alienate him from most of his peers. Quinoa has never really had friends before. He knew many of the Keep staff, but many of his caretakers were much older than him and tended to keep an arm’s length from him in personal matters to remain professional. At one point, he became so desperate to learn to make a friend that on one of his early semesters in seminary school, while away from the Keep, he hired a prostitute simply to have someone to talk to. This person’s name was Yuca - he took quite a liking to Quin after meeting him and found his bashful and nervous nature endearing. Yuca became Quin’s first real friend. The two became fast friends, often venturing out into the streets of New Ark together on adventures. Yuca was Quinoa’s first kiss - Quin wanted to experience one and felt awful for asking until Yuca assured him it was ok - but nothing ever became of them romantically as they were more inclined to be friends. As his studies became more intense, Quin and Yuca fell out of contact, and he hadn’t seen him before he ran away upon hearing the news of his father's death."9/18/2017 12:03:58,Bellamy Vandeskorn,Half-Elf,Bard,"   Bellamy was born to a courtesan in the house of an intermediate lord. His mother is a human and his father is an elf, although his father has not been present in Bellamy's life. Bellamy is indifferent to his absent father and his mother doesn't ponder the topic often either. Because Bellamy never met his father, he took his mother's last name. While Bellamy has a positive relationship with his mother as one of mutual admiration, they are not very close because his mother was often too busy to parent him properly. Bellamy considers the fact that he was not really raised by his mother as a positive because it has allowed him to grow up learning from a spectrum of people in his environment and allowed him to grow into a diverse and unique individual.   Bellamy received an in-house education intended for nobility, because his lord recognized that half-elves usually make reputable diplomats and Bellamy was the only half-elf in his mostly human court. As a child, Bellamy's social interaction was largely limited to the lord's courtiers and tutors with the occasional guest interaction. Bellamy has a naturally likable personality stemming from his penchant for optimism and his pursuit of understanding new perspectives. Bellamy was an enthusiastic student, especially with natural science, language, history, and music. He spent much of his free time as an adolescent reading or drawing in the gardens, conversing with guests and sharing stories.   In Bellamy's teenage and young adult years, his personal freedoms had extended beyond the grounds and into the surrounding town. He had been groomed for diplomacy and was still in the process of learning, so his training often led him to interact with common people as well as vassals and traders. However, his tutors did not bother to assign such activities to him because he could often be found interacting with these people outside of his studies regardless. Bellamy grew a compassion for common folk, finding them to be more honest than the average noble. He began to spend time in popular social spots around town and played music for money on occasion.   In Bellamy's adult life, he has worked as his lord's public assistant. It's a decent paying job that comes with most of the amenities of living in the lord's manor. For this job, Bellamy interacts with the lord's subjects to soothe misgivings on new policies and sway dissenters' opinions. Officially, Bellamy is listed as the lord's entertainer (which he also does to some extent).   Bellamy views his lord highly and generally agrees with his policies, so Bellamy doesn't view the work he does as dishonest. Bellamy is a proponent of honesty and genuine social interaction, and he has a reputation as an honest man.   Bellamy is an odd character in many ways due to his philosophy on nature and beauty. As a fashionably thin half-elven man, he takes great care to keep up his appearance. He invests in a wide-ranging wardrobe and takes great care of his hair, going so far as to often paint his nails and don makeup. It is not against his nature to occasionally let his promiscuity get in the way of his duties, especially if he's been drinking. He can swing so many ways that not many people are off the table for him. Despite his flaws of apparent vanity and looseness, he sees beauty in all things and has an air of optimism about himself. While he still plays music at venues he goes to like he did when he was younger, the money he gets from his performances will usually be directed to the less fortunate. Since he enjoys writing and playing music, he views getting paid for it as a nice, but unnecessary, bonus.   Since Bellamy has been cooped up in one town for most of his life with the occasional trip to vassal states and neighboring holdings, he longs to see the world beyond his sphere that so many people have told stories of. While he's not built for adventure, he wants to record the adventures of a traveling group and accompany them so he may help them as they view appropriate."9/18/2017 14:51:00,Finarieth Vrue,Half-elf,Sorcerer,"Finarieth (Fin) Vrye. 30 years old. 5’10. Fair skin, blonde hair, brown eyes. I wear gloves almost 24/7. My mother came from a very old, noble elf family that placed heavy restrictions on her behavior. In a fit of rebellion, she had a brief affair with my father. She realized that she wasn't cut out to live so far from her family, so she returned and gave birth to me six months later. She was generally uninvolved with my upbringing, as was standard for her family. I was always treated differently because of my human blood. The family elders refused to allow my mother to give me the family surname (Eiraval), so she gave me my father's (Vrye). Growing up, I was the family scapegoat, blamed for anything and everything that went wrong. My cousins were spoiled and cossetted; I was given perfunctory attention and was usually treated with bald hostility. The Eiraval were too good for physical violence, but it was made very clear that I was worthless and unwanted. My mother, cowed by the fear of being ousted from the family, never spoke or acted in my defense. She was a stranger to me. My grandmother, Ylien, was the worst of the bunch. She was the strongest proponent of sending me away, or, if I had to stay, treating me like a servant. Because of her, I spent a lot of time with the various travelers who came through town— they were the lowest class and therefore, as far as she was concerned, the most appropriate company for me. I was so jealous of their freedom, and a few of them took pity on me, teaching me simple cons and tricks. One day when I was 13, a woman came through town who told fortunes and performed other minor magical feats for money. She asked if I wanted to have my fortune told, but I said no, I’d rather not know, because it couldn’t be good. Instead, I asked her how she did it. She told me about an encounter she’d had with a demonic creature— she gave it her sense of smell in exchange for her abilities. Fascinated, I wheedled the whole story out of her, including the ritual she used to do it. When I got home, I stole my cousin’s pet bird, sacrificed it, and summoned up a demon of my own. It said it would give me the power to escape my circumstances and make my own way in the world, for a price. I was ready to give it anything it asked, so when it named its price as my ability to form emotional bonds, I thought I was getting one hell of a deal. I didn’t have any emotional bonds to speak of, and I couldn’t imagine ever having any with anyone I knew, so I agreed. That night, I packed and waited. At midnight, a small vibration started in what felt like the middle of my brain. Gradually it trickled down to my hands until it grew to an unbearable itch. Thunder rolled in the distance, but I could hardly hear it. No amount of scratching helped, and by the time my palms were raw and bleeding, it crescendoed to a powerful buzz that was, finally, not painful but all-consuming. Lightning struck our house. Fires sprung up in places that the lightning hadn’t struck, and somehow the surrounding rain refused to touch it. The itching subsided. I didn’t know what part of that was my doing, but I knew I was responsible. And now more than ever, I didn’t care if anyone in the house lived or died, so I took my things and left. I traveled far away from our home in Siar, stealing and using the tricks I’d learned to run small cons and fixed games. Eventually, I made my way to Shawnbridge, where I settled. I began a lucrative career as a burglar, starting with small residential homes and moving up to banks and jewelry stores. It’s been 15 years, and while I’m not quite a local legend, other criminals definitely know about me. I’m known only as Fin, and I don’t address my elf heritage at all, ever, with anyone. I have a solid network of contacts among other thieves, fences, smugglers, and the occasional assassin. I rarely work on contract, stealing only for myself. I use as little magic as possible, though I sometimes can’t help it. When I’m in danger, my hands itch, and I have about five minutes to figure it out myself, practically or magically, or it just bursts out of me in whatever form seems helpful. (It’s not always that helpful.) Lately, now that I’m reaching full adulthood, I’ve started to regret not being able to make friends. I’ve been in the same place for a long time now, and I have connections, but I consider no one a friend. None of my liasons have ever had a romantic component. I’ve begun to feel lonely. So when a cleric approached me and asked to enlist my skills in stealing a religious amulet, I thought that maybe that could be the key to getting back what the demon took from me. A favor from a goddess would trump a demon, right? So I agreed, violating my usual no-contract rule, and set out with the cleric. (I don’t like the cleric, partly because he’s very rule-oriented, but mostly because he’s also a half-elf, and I have no small amount of self-loathing left over from childhood.)"9/18/2017 6:00:18,Finexel Finnton,half-elf,monk,"Finexel Finnton was born to a elf/drow mix 'lady of convenience' named Arrelia Finnton.  His father was the 16 year old son of the well respected Lord Vancil.  This was, to put it lightly, far from ideal for everyone involved.  When his grandfather found out about Finn, he was angry and ashamed that his son could be so careless and foolish.  This was not proper behavior for a Vancil.  The grandfather, being honorable where his son was not, ensured that the kid was cared for and raised right.  He was given to a monastery for education and care.  He could never be acknowledged, for things like that were never done for halfbreeds born out of marriage, but at least he would have a life free of suffering.  The mother was paid off and Finn never saw her again.While studying at the monastery, Finn showed promise in a number of academic areas, especially that of mathematics and language.  While he lacked any particular religious or magical leanings, he was a good study that seemed to actually enjoy learning.  He was also well known for his quick reflexes and natural athleticism, obviously taking after his family's long line of excellent swordsmen.  Finn remained at the monastery for 15 years, where he was occasionally visited by his grandfather's old friend Ebenor Solterra.When it was time for him to leave, Solterra offered him a position with the family.  It would make use of his talents with language and understanding of the extra-natural world.  He spent a few years working on various trade ventures with foreign groups, on procuring and trading objects of religious or arcane significance, and generally helping see his family be successful.  He was rarely at the Vancil estates during this time, which is good since his father and the Lady Vancil, who had married and had a son while he was in the monastery, were never pleased to see him.About 5 years after he started with the family, his grandfather fell ill.  Finn rushed home to see him on his death bed.  This was an unfortunate point in Finn's life.  The grandfather required Finn to promise to see that the family remain a respected and powerful house, despite his son's earnest attempts to destroy it in drunken rages and unwise investments.  Finn swore to do what he could and to keep the name strong, even though it wasn't officially his name.Shortly after the grandfather's death, Finn was banned from the household by his father's wife.  He ended up staying with Solterra and doing what he could to support the family, but they shut him out of many of the family's dealings.  While Solterra was sympathetic, he was also the family's solicitor and thus bound by law to respect the family's wishes.  Finn resorted to more clandestine means to learn what was going on and ways to mitigate it.  Finn would often spend evenings skulking around the grounds, sneaking into the office to read correspondence, and to send messages in his father's name.Finn managed this for a number of years.  It was not going well.  He had managed to divert several streams of correspondence and had a respectable enough trade with some arcane practitioners, he was actually able to keep the family in a positive revenue stream, barely, but they had some funds in the bank once more.  Unfortunately, his father's wife died in a horse riding accident and his father broke down completely.  He became a recluse, cut off communications and trade agreements, and slowly drank himself to death.  Finn even tried to see him, once, and was beaten severely by his father for daring to disgrace his brother by showing his face among the true and proper family.Solterra was forbidden, by order, of telling Finn about his father's death or the actions of Finn's half-brother in liquidating all assets and fleeing across the ocean.  Of course, Finn learned that his father was dead very soon after it happened, but was unable to locate his brother until a message arrived from across the ocean.  Solterra interpreted Lord Vancil's request in a convenient way and brought Finn in to explain what had happened.  Finn was distraught.  The family name had been reduced to dirt; a name belonging to drunks and fools who can't be relied upon to stick around when things get tough.Finn spends some time attempting to determine the nature of the agreement his brother made with the Sczarni in Magnimar and how it can be managed.  He comes to believe it is far from good and realizes these guys aren't exactly nice people when they aren't paid. When he explains all of this to Solterra, the old Solicitor decides this may be a good time to let the young man try a more active role in his life.  He provides Finn with some money and gear, in deference to the memory of his good friend and the adventures he had with Finn's grandfather.  Finn goes forth to finally take an active role in securing his promise to his grandfather.  He travels to Magnimar and meets with numerous local nobles.  His reception as a representative of House Vancil of Absalom is unexpectedly warm.  He doesn't believe the locals are actually talking about his half-brother when they describe the positive things coming from Lord Vancil in Sandpoint.  While he hasn't personally interacted with his brother in a few years, he has kept an eye on him and his activities and none of this makes much sense.  What seemed more liked his brother was the explanation of his activities with the Sczarni when they explain that the debt was given to the Sandpoint branch."9/18/2017 13:08:20,Rowan Varis,Half-elf,Cleric/druid,"Rowan was raised by her aunt and uncle, Janna and Eamon Varis, who adopted her as their own after Rowan’s mother died in childbirth.  Rowan thinks that she is the natural daughter of Eamon and Janna, and no one has disabused her of that belief.  In actuality, she is the product of a liaison between Eamon’s sister Leah and one of the druids of the circle in the Swamp of Darmass.  Knowing that if the truth of Rowan’s heritage was exposed she would be ostracized by the other townsfolk, Janna and Eamon decided to keep the knowledge from her for her own protection.  Those old enough to recall Leah’s running away from Mosstone and subsequent pregnant return may have an inkling that something is different about Rowan, but the only other person in the village with concrete knowledge is Father Caius, the local priest.Rowan’s childhood began essentially the same as any other growing up in Mosstone.  Her time was split between helping with daily chores, exploring and playing in the outlying marshes of the Swamp of Darmass, and being tutored under Father Caius, the priest of Pelor.  As she grew she paid close attention to his lessons and quickly picked up the basics of how to treat those afflicted with sickness and disease.  By the time Rowan was eight, Father Caius has realized that she might be destined for more than the other children of Mosstone, and set aside extra time each week to teach her more about the tenets of Pelor.  Surprised by her affinity for healing magics, he started to allow her to accompany him about his priestly duties.  From tending the ill to distributing alms to leading services, wherever Caius went, Rowan was close behind.  The sole exception to this routine was once a week when Caius led travelers into the Swamp of Darmass, as he forbid Rowan to go with him because of the dangers.As Rowan grew closer to the age of majority, her aptitude with the religious duties grew as well.  She became particularly adept with the blessing of the crops at the beginning of each planting season, causing a succession of hugely bountiful harvests for the village.  Many townsfolk began to view Rowan as Caius’ unofficial acolyte, knowing that it would only be a matter of time before she was formally invested into the Church of Pelor.  In addition to shadowing Caius about his daily rounds, she would spend several hours each day foraging in the marsh for medicinal plants and herbs.  One day while scouring the marsh for sundew plants, Rowan found herself further into the Swamp of Darmass than she had anticipated.  Realizing that she had gotten completely lost, she determinedly set off to find her way back to Mosstone.After several hours of walking, Rowan recognized that she was now even more lost than before.  Though she had fixed her path by the glimpses of the sun that she caught through the thick forest canopy, knowing that it was descending to the west, she had not come out upon the marshlands.  With night quickly approaching, she decided to look for a sheltered place to rest and resolved to resume her search in the morning.  Though she could see fairly well in the murky twilight, a fatal misstep on an uneven cluster of rocks caused Rowan to fall backward and strike her head against the offending rubble, knocking her unconscious.Rowan awoke the following morning to find a heavy weight seemingly bearing down on her legs.  Flailing about in a panic, she managed to sit up far enough to find herself face-to-muzzle with a large gray wolf.  Rapidly drawing in a breath as a preface to a shrieking fit, the realization struck Rowan that the wolf would have eaten her by now if it had meant to do so.  It was then she heard a muted chuckling coming from behind her, and she twisted around to see a male elf step from amongst the trees.  He quickly allayed her fears by explaining that he was one of the druids of the circle located within the Swamp of Darmass, and that she was in no danger from him or the wolf.  Indeed, it seemed the wolf had “chosen” her as his companion, and that such bonds were hard to sever.Something about the elf’s nature inspired trust in Rowan and she decided to accompany him to meet the rest of the circle per his suggestion.  He mentioned that they had already sent word to Father Caius that Rowan had been found, and that she would be safe with the druids within the swamp until Caius passed through escorting the next group of travelers.  As the little party started off further into the forest he introduced himself as Aldoren, and the wolf, who stuck close to Rowan’s side, as Lyr.  After what seemed like only a few miles on foot, the dense forest suddenly gave way to a lush meadow containing concentric circles of hawthorn and ash trees, centered around an immense oak.  Gazing about nervously, Rowan heard what sounded like a faint strain of music coming from the grove of trees.  It almost sounded as if the trees were… singing?After several minutes, Rowan realized that she was alone except for Lyr.  The faint musical sounds grew louder, as if calling to Rowan.  She and the wolf stepped forward into the trees.  All at once, time slowed to a crawl and her senses were assailed by sounds, smells, and visions.  She could hear every rustle of the leaves and every splash of the rain.  She could smell the rich, dark soil and the dry, sweet scent of wheat.  The cycle of the seasons spun on forever into the future in her mind’s eye, an endless sequence of life and death.  Just before Rowan was overwhelmed by everything, an impossibly beautiful, ageless elven woman emerged from the midst of the chaos, and spoke.  Claiming Rowan as her daughter, she decreed that Rowan would stay with the circle and learn their ways.  Trembling, Rowan could only nod her head in agreement as the figure loomed above her and disappeared, along with the rest of the sensations.For the next four years, Rowan lived with the druids of the Order of the Verdant Grove.  Though they shared all their teachings with her, they also held themselves back.  Rowan had been touched by Melora, a thing only spoken of in the oldest of tales.  No one wanted to anger the goddess by getting too close.  The night before Rowan was to be inducted into the Order, Melora came to her again in a dream.  Rowan was to leave the druids and travel to the aid of the dwarves in Icemaul, far to the north."9/17/2017 20:02:49,Tommy Toes,half-elf,rogue,"The story of Tommy Toes starts with his father, but before that it starts with his mother's ex-girlfriend.  The three of them were once part of an adventuring group called the Tavernheads.  Raul Twelve-toes, Johnny's father, was the barbarian of the group.  Sigyl Signs, his mother, was the group's elven sorcerer, and Helga MacNamara was the gnomish cleric and the group's leader.  Along with the dragonborn psion Itz Kilstreak and the dwarven rogue Salyar Rubbletongue, the Tavernheads traveled the world fighting great evils, including the legendary lizardfolk archmage Deathscale, the ancient water dragon Nora Infinito, and a remarkably tenacious dire were-squirrel.  Helga was constantly seeking out the most dangerous missions she could find, and even after they recruited the lizardfolk ranger Alfonzina, their constant trips through vast, yet-unsettled wilderness to reach these challenges often pushed them even closer to death than the armies of skeletons.  Intra-party squabbles were frequent, and more than once once Itz and Salyar came to blows over ownership of items, and what they couldn't just leave behind for the month-long trek back to civilization.  Whenever this happened, Helga would simply withhold all healing privileges from all offending party members until the situation was resolved, usually by giving the offending item to her.  This brashness attracted Sigyl to her, and the two eventually got married in a touching ceremony marred only slightly by the momentary delay caused by an attacking dracolich.However, one day, Helga pushed Salyar to his limit.  Enraged at having to sell off a magical bow he rarely used in order to purchase an expensive magical item to supplement Itz's powers, he stormed off to sulk in the tavern while the Tavernheads went to the Dungeon of Infernals, which is a fairly self-explanatory location.  If Salyar had been present, maybe he could have deactivated the trap that vaporised Sigyl in one blow.  Helga tried to resurrect her, but not enough was left.  She would do anything to save her.  Anything at all.  Which, of course, was exactly the point.Of the others, Alfonzina was the first to realize what had happened, but by then it was too late.  Sigyl was waking up, confused.  Helga was standing over her, her body ensnared in a dark power.  “I saved you,” she said, “so let's hurry.”  But when she went to touch Sigyl's hand, the elven woman screamed in pain before their palms even made contact.  Sigyl still didn't understand.  But Helga did.  “This is the culmination of my power,” she said, “the culmination of my journey.  This unlimited power is my gift, and I will give it to the world.  I have always fought to protect mortalkind.  Now I will fight to uplift it.”Then a magical bolt pierced her temple, and the window burst open, and the light shone in and devoured everything.  Salyar rescued Itz last, but when all is recorded, let it be known that he did rescue him.  Do not forget this fact.The archmage Gaius, who had teleported there, did not have enough strength to seal off the temple, so he gave Sigyl the tools to do so, and once she had done this, she collapsed, both from the expense of far more magical energy than she thought she had in her, and under the emotional weight of what she had done.  Once they got back to town, Gaius billed them for his services — a bill which just happened to be exactly as large as the sum total of everything the party owned.  And that was the last day the Tavernheads were adventurers.  Friends they remained, but not one of them ever would become a quester again.At least, that was the plan.You see, five years later, Sigyl and Raul got married, moved to the vegetable farm that Sigyl's mother used to own, and had a kid.  Eight years later they had another, and eight years after that everything got massively screwed up forever.The thing about Sigyl and Raul's first child, Patty Toes, is that she was blind from birth.  Sigyl and Raul had tried time and again to find a cleric to fix her, but you can't fix what's already broken.  Patty always insisted that she was fine — she could hear the heartbeats of animals well enough to hunt in pitch blackness as well as she could in broad daylight, which is to say as well as anyone, so really, what was all the fuss about?  Her younger brother Tommy, in fact, admired her so much that after he learned to hunt with his eyes, he put on a blindfold and had Patty teach him to hunt with his other senses.  Raul didn't approve — he knew from when he was a beginner barbarian that showing off like that could lead to self-injury — and ordered Tommy never to take napkins or handkerchiefs out into the woods during practice.  Which is when Tommy learned to steal.Tommy admired all of his parents' old friends.  Itz had a lot of neat stories and swear words, and he taught Tommy much of the draconic tongue — especially its baudier bits, and often not deliberately.  Salyar was the only adult who understood about the thrill of subterfuge, and gave him lessons he probably shouldn't have gotten.  Alfonzina was an incredible hunter, tracker, and forager, and both he and her sister would watch enraptured as she showed them some technique or other for figuring out where such and such subspecies dire rabbit was wont to set up its warren.And then one day his father came home from selling the season's crops at the local trading port with nothing to show for it but a strange-looking idol.  He said it was of some important goddess or other, but Tommy knew from pictures that it wasn't in her likeness at all.  He personally thought it a rather shoddy work.  Well, it was that, too.  For you see, Raul claimed that praying on it for three days and nights would give Patty her sight.  She initially declined this, but eventually relented.But after the third night, not only could Patty not see the ornate hand-carved furniture and various oddities that her parents had painstakingly earned and collected over the years to trick themselves into thinking they still had access to the vast fortunes they once laid claims to as members of the Tavernheads, neither could anyone else.Sigyl went to the city to ask around, but when she returned, all she could gather was that he had bought the idol from some backstreet dealer for a ridiculous sum under the impression that it could heal her daughter, and that other people with similar stories had been appearing, with the idol at the center of it all.  “Magic,” she cursed under her breath.  “I should have been able to tell.  I'm going on a walk around the tomato patch; I need to gather my thoughts.”That was the last time the two of them saw her again.Their will hadn't been updated for sixteen years, so the farm passed to Salyar.  He obliged out of respect for his years of camaraderie with Sigyl and Raul, but didn't know the first thing about farming, however, so despite Tommy and Patty's best efforts, boulders gathered in the fields, the soil lost its fertility, and the three basically became foragers who happened to own farm-shaped property.  Until Salyar, in the first truly generous act and most mind-bogglingly stupid decision of his life, traded the farm to a peasant-boy for all the boy had on him, which was a piece of stale bread and some tasteless wine the boy had found next to a busted-up barrel in an alleyway.  The same alleyway, in fact, though that is just a coincidence.Now homeless, Tommy and Patty had nothing to do except track down their parents.  Which would make for a pretty exciting story of Tommy weren't such an incredible dickweed who steals for no reason, is a jerk to pretty much everyone even when it makes things inconvenient for himself, and whose incredible ability to focus on achieving his goal at any cost would be much more useful if he actually had a concrete goal beyond “find someone who's probably dead and someone who wants to remain hidden and knows exactly how we'll go about looking for her”."9/18/2017 8:52:51,Craros Nyoho,Half-Elf,Cleric,"Craros Nyoho (child name: Genko Georgio) is a Half-Elf orphan raised by humans. Knowing little of his past, he was placed in the care of the Georgio family in the city of Volos on the country of Crescent. He grew up beside his step-brother Jono, who while a few years younger was the same age relative to their lifespan differences.At the age of 16, before he’d be considered an adult and claim his new name in Elvish tradition, he left home to practice at the Genevius Monastery. His father had recently been assassinated, and Genko felt lost in the world. He needed some form of guidance, something to believe in. Although it hurt him to leave his brother in that awful period of their life, he knew that it had to be done. He took part of his inheritance to take a carriage to a port town, and from there took a boat to the Country the Genevius Monastery was located: [insert country].Genevius is a God of unknown shape or form, who places virtue in walking the “righteous path” that is specific to every one person. Those who found a path and followed it received Genevius’ Favor. This was an important lesson burnt into Genko’s mind by his strict, passionate teacher: Master Toji.Master Toji was by no means a traditional teacher or a traditional Cleric. Even in a religion generally considered unorthodox, his methods of teaching and interacting with his students were considered bizarre. For one, his concept of righteousness was very different from many of the other Clerics and Monks at the Monastery. While their concept of it was one of Quixotic bravery, total selflessness, and absolute virtue, Toji’s was centered around moral relativity, utilitarianism, and a staying true to one’s beliefs. Although Genko, through his education and young adulthood, was still working out what his idea of righteousness was, the beliefs of Master Toji very heavily influenced him. Besides the talented Genko, Master Toji taught two other students alongside him. A human female named Velline, and a half-orc male named Crodsworth.A half-orc being attempting to become a cleric in most other monasteries would likely be met with rejection, but the Genevius Church was far more accepting. Crodsworth was much more human looking than orc which certainly helped as well. Genko and Crodsworth hit it off as friends, as Crodsworth had also come from a prestigious household in Crescent, albeit on the opposite coast of Volos. His father, an alumni of the Monastery, had sent him in an attempt to teach him responsibility, virtue, and civility. Being half-orc, Crodsworth often felt at war with himself, often getting violent urges. He was almost kicked out after beating his previous teacher to a bloody pulp. It was only with the incessant protesting of Master Toji that kept him in with the promise to take him on as his own student. The one time Crodsworth had lost his tempter with Toji and charged at him, Master Toji used his own force against Crodsworth, who found himself flipped onto his back with a foot on his chest. Then, the hand of the compassionate Toji extended to help him up. He was not chastised, nor was the occurrence ever mentioned to any other members of the faculty. After that, the two worked heavily on learning to accept the duality of himself, and Crodsworth never had a violent incident after that. He learned to control his feelings, and also to utilize them in his sparring matches with Genko. The two ended up sharing a dorm together in their last two years at the monastery, and developed a brotherly sort of bond. Genko saw a bit of Jono within Crodsworth, and perhaps that’s why they got along so well.Genko could not say that his relationship with Velline was as positive as his with Crodsworth. He could not deny her talent, but he found her pretension and snobbery obnoxious. She often argued with Master Toji, and frequently questioned his methods.While Master Toji always respected the questioning of authority, even he was tired by her obsession with semantics. She was intelligent, fierce, determined, and kind of a bitch. Genko respected her, but he by no means liked her. Velline didn’t do either for Genko.However, many of the highest ranking members of the Monastery had different ideas of what the “righteous path” meant. The doctrine of the Monastery was altered, with its focus no longer being to prepare its members to find their path and set off on it, but to instead make its members place all of their efforts into expanding and benefiting the church, even collecting Indulgences allegedly granting Genevius’ Favor.Instead of Genevian Clerics and Monks, they began to send out simple missionaries repeating pre-rehearsed phrases that greatly differed from what original Genevians taught. The Monastery being their own home, many of the followers chose to simply accept this change instead of creating a schism and losing the only thing they had. They even eventually came to believe these new teachings. The first to speak out against this was Genko’s Master. He did not present his beliefs to the Grand Cleric, but instead posted a collection of essays upon the door of the Council Hall, and left during the night without a word, with the exception of a letter for each of his three students.Genko’s read:“Genko,I’ve already left. I by no means encourage you to follow. This is my path. You must find yours.~Toji""Genko became disillusioned by the Monastery after his favorite and most trusted teacher was expelled from it on grounds of Heresy for calling out this greed-driven sacrilege. He had learned the essential skills of a Cleric, and although he knew he would be labeled a Heretic and cast out from the Monastery, he spoke out against the Grand Cleric. In spite of the advice of his teacher, he decided leaving was the righteous path for him. After studying the essays the church had attempted to remove all trace of, he found he could no longer stay at the monastery without abandoning his ideals of righteousness.Of Toji’s students, two left the monastery as heretics. Genko, and a while later Crodsworth. Crodsworth found the change in direction for the sake of greed and expansion disgusting. Although he was in control of his urges at this time, he lost control at one integral moment. He was passing by some high ranking Clerics when he heard them talking about the sacrilege of Master Toji. He was painted as someone evil, who stood against everything the Monastery meant. Genko and Crodsworth had discussed whether what Toji said about the monastery was true before, and had both become disgusted by the thought of continuing their relationship with the organization. Crodsworth felt his blood boil, and he beat the Cleric to a bloody pulp with his bare hands before fleeing. He knew he could never return to his father after this, so he left to start a new life with his skills. He assumed Genko would return to Volos, but he figured he would take on a new identity as the two were both aware of how the Monastery treated heretics. Crodsworth decided to do the same, and it seemed at that time that the two friends would never meet again. Crodsworth adopted the name Bento Borneo and set off towards the southern coast of Crescent.Velline continued her work as a missionary, finding the money good and the housing stable. She eventually rose up to be a high ranking member of the Monastery. Genko was pleased to be relinquished of her company.After losing status in the organization and being expelled from all of the Monastery’s few other locations, he returned to Crescent and his childhood home at the age of 20. He gave himself the new name Craros Nyoho to both grant himself some anonymity from the Religion’s new sect of Zealots that set out to silence those who left the Organization, as well as in Elvish tradition when one reaches adulthood. Craros wondered about the fate of Toji and Crodsworth. They would likely do the same in taking a new identity and going into hiding. Toji himself had kept his past secret, and his students didn’t even know where his hometown was. The only thing Craros had learned about his past was hearing Toji talking to another Cleric in passing, where he heard Toji say, “[mumble mumble] back in Red Swork we used to [mumble mumble]”. All Craros knew about Red Swork at the time was that it was a city even bigger and more populated than Volos. Finding a specific person there would be like finding an honest man in a crowd, which is an expression Master Toji had often used.Upon reaching the Georgio family, he finds that his brother Jono has long since left. Townsfolk who knew him claim he had left to pursue mercenary work, but had become rotten to the core years ago and joined a local, enigmatic gang. Craros searched for some time to find his brother, with no luck. He kept himself hidden, as he knew Volos was the first place the Zealots would search. Slowly, but surely, he gathered information on the Patricia family that Jono had joined. They were a powerful group that essentially ruled the city. He knew it was a hopeless lead, however, as even if he were to interrogate one of the members they would never reveal any information on Jono, not that he would ever resort to torture.All he had been able to learn was that he had recently left the organization, in spite of having become a powerful member at such a young age. The only hint he’d received was by a close confidant of Jono, a member of the gang he ran with who went by the name Abato. Although he did not know where Jono was, as Volos was a large city, he did believe Craros when he said he was was Jono’s brother as Jono had told them about his family before. All that Abato could tell Craros was about an organization named Violet, which was the group who killed their father, and a man who went by the pseudonym Sapphire. Sapphire was the boss of Violet, and the one who orchestrated the murder of Alexi Georgio. He was a man with blue hair and a robotic left forearm. That was the only thing they were ever able to uncover.Craros lived on the streets of Volos for a while. His family’s home had been demolished, and he found little hospitality elsewhere. He spent his time scouring for information about Sapphire, hoping it would reunite him with his brother. The only responses he received were people not knowing what he was talking about, or people attacking him as soon as the name Sapphire was spoken. One night, close to the end of the year, he was walking to his temporary residence at an inn past a local bar, only to bump into a man coming out of said bar. The man looked aggravated, and Craros was cautious. He looked at the man’s face, and saw the eyes of someone who had seen much violence and grief, someone who was lost and searching for something out of his reach. But beneath all that, he saw the unmistakable jovial cheeriness of his brother.Craros laughed, hard. All this time he had spent searching for his brother, hoping for a cathartic reunion, and he just happened to bump into him outside of a bar. Over the past few weeks, he had frequently questioned whether or not he was on the right path, whether Genevius would approve. He almost even gave up hope and resigned to the fact that he would never find his brother or he might even be dead. And now, being questioned by his brother about what was so funny, he knew that he’d been walking the right path all along. He pulled down his hood, spoke to Jono his old name of Genko Georgio for the first time in so long, and was immediately pulled in for a long, powerful hug.They caught each other up on all of the events of the past few years. Jono told Craros of his life as an officer in the Patricia family, and Craros told him of his expulsion from the Monastery and his new label as a Heretic. They had both been searching after Sapphire, though for Jono is was vengeance and Craros it was to find his brother. Craros was sad to see his home in such disarray, and the two slowly started to weed out the more notorious criminals. They were searching for Sapphire or any clues to find him, yet in their actions became seen as unknown heroes of Volos. They embraced the mythos behind this unforeseen fame, and donned reflective masks while they worked.Soon, the city had reached record low levels of crime, and it was prospering and beautiful once again. Even the Patricia family, although largely untouched by the so-called Twilight Knights (besides some low level thugs that had disobeyed orders and acted against Patricia family code), had pulled back on their less than ethical operations. Perhaps it was out of fear that the Twilight Knights would retaliate, or perhaps it was out of respect.Jono’s gang never officially learned that Jono was a Twilight Knight, but they recognized that the mark on society the Twilight Knights left was something only someone as inspired as Jono could accomplish.Feeling their job was done, and still with no leads on Sapphire, they head towards the capital of Crescent, known by many for its iconic gigantic red sword and by others for its propensity of guiding people towards their fates.

Their control of the region’s rich platinum veins along with a tight grip on the local government had led to quite the accumulated fortune over the years. As of Varik’s birth the mines had been stripped clean for decades, but the Edelsteins saw no reason to relinquish their accustomed lifestyle and status at the top of their provincial heap. Their sprawling manor dominated Glimcrag’s town center, with its splendor waning with age as the Edelsteins kept a progressively tighter grip on their remaining wealth. Realistically, most things in Glimcrag were on the decline. While far from a ghost town yet, Glimcrag’s infrastructure was also showing signs of neglect as tax income diminished, with many structures now lying unused. Many families were clinging to their land and property, farmers in particular, and there was still money in catering to travelers and caravaneers, but no one would describe the streets as “bustling” anymore. The Edelsteins themselves tended to keep to their bubble of relative wealth and rarely mixed with the greater populace.Varik’s mother was Louenna Edelstein, the beautiful daughter of the Edelstein patriarch currently holding the Glimcrag’s mayorship. She was known as a free spirit, mercurial and moody, and was a popular topic of gossip thanks to her flirtatious nature and torrid romances that began and ended abruptly. She was also the subject of an old family superstition, regarding a curse on the family’s progeny. That every four generations the female Edelstein heirs would only birth cursed children, weak and deformed. If asked, those within the family would spout their version of a tale regarding a hag angered centuries ago. Those outside the family liked chalking the “curse” up to a family history of marrying within a narrow pool. Whatever the truth, Louenna was discouraged from seeking marriage and especially from seeking motherhood. Louenna’s capriciousness was enough to make marriage unlikely on its own. Despite this factor, it was well known that she greatly desired to raise a child, and many suspected this desire stemmed from feeling denied the option.Thus, when Louenna dallied with a wood elf trader and conceived a child, many presumed it was to thwart the curse’s terms. After all, a half-blood illegitimate child would certainly not be considered an Edelstein.  The father vanished the day the pregnancy became known, and there was a minor scandal, particularly since an unlanded trader was considered of low social status. This bounced off Louenna for the most part, who insisted on bringing the child to term. Even considering the scandal her father had no real desire to disown her, and so Louenna retained her place in the manor, Varik was born, and the family eventually moved on to the next scandal. Despite his absence, Louenna bestowed Varik with his father’s Elvish surname of Yhendhorn. With the Edelstein’s lukewarm reception of the child, she likely saw no reason to fight to attach her own surname.As for the curse, whether supernatural or a fluke of nature, the newborn Varik did not escape it. He was indeed born with deformities, most notably his misshapen legs and a preternaturally frail constitution. His odds of survival were considered low, but Louenna insisted he be well cared for. The sickly child persisted. He was plagued with breathing difficulties, a weak stomach, and a tendency to tire easy, none of which improved as he grew older. Varik did learn to walk, but only with the aid of a walking stick as his own legs could not support himself properly. He also had a way of catching contagious illnesses at the drop of a hat and was slow to recover. Louenna ached at seeing her son suffer, and when possible used what access she had to the family fortune to hire clerics and other healers. They would ease his symptoms and even cure him of any contagious disease he suffered, but his underlying condition never improved. Louenna chalked this up to the curse, but as attempts at curse removal also failed, the healers were more commonly of the opinion that you could not cure someone of the circumstances of their birth.Varik’s family was largely indifferent to his presence within the manor and considered him Louenna’s problem. While even as a bastard child, he had some social obligation to them, their treatment tended to be icy and distant. His mother was of course the exception to this, always doting on him and hating to let him out of her sight for long. Young Varik came to prefer solitude and developed a dim view of his various cousins, aunts, and uncles, with “twit” being the word he would use to describe the majority. His mother oversaw his care, but as time grew on he became less and less tolerant of even her presence. Both of them had a stubborn streak and rarely had breathing room from from each other. Varik’s frustration with her constant attention and control festered and manifested in attempts to assert his independence: performing strenuous tasks without her aid, refusing the latest expensive treatment she purchased, venturing out on his own with no warning, etc. These protests usually backfired and would only lead to tearful reprimands from Louenna, who would then keep an even sharper eye on him. She also would worry about his reclusive nature and engage in heavy-handed attempts to help him make friends. The occasional forced play dates were awkward, with Varik having little in common with children his age. This habit of hers became far worse as he entered his teens and she transitioned to introducing him to “nice girls.” This went about as well as one would expect. Throughout all this, a constant point of contention was Louenna’s continued habit of acquiring and dropping beaus and the associated uncomfortable introductions.While Varik’s family life was always rocky, a comforting constant for him was his love of the written word. He learned to read before he learned to walk, and outpaced his tutors by the time he was a preteen. He also showed a knack for scribing with pen and ink. Despite Varik’s tepid relationship with the greater Edelstein family, he was often called upon when someone needed a letter or other document drafted in a hurry. When Varik was well enough to venture from the manor, he was commonly found in the town’s library. The shabby collection of dated tomes had been languishing for some decades thanks to poor funding and reduced demand for its services. Despite the place’s poor condition, Varik felt at ease amongst the cobwebby stacks and would wile away hours there, until his mother came looking for him or the dusty air forced him to leave prematurely. He read whatever he could get his hands on, even teaching himself Elven, Gnomish, and Dwarfish to partake of the more exotic texts when he ran out of books in Common. While he read indiscriminately, he particularly reveled in escapism, anything that gave him a taste of the world beyond his own dull corner of Faerun, whether it be tales of high adventure or detailed geographic texts.Shortly before Varik’s nineteenth birthday, the woman who had maintained the library passed of old age, leaving the aging building’s fate uncertain. To the surprise of his greater family and the protest of his mother, Varik volunteered to take over as librarian. While it was questioned he was qualified, no one else was terribly interested. Apathy saw the position handed to Varik. Besides, if an elderly woman managed the place by herself, maybe a crippled half-elf could.Varik was also uncertain he was qualified, but was motivated by an emotional attachment to the collection. Besides, it was an excuse to spend more time away from the manor. While technically an adult now, his health was not improving and his prospects for an independent life without his mother were looking slim. He gave the task his all, feeling that if he should make the most of his state of being stuck in Glimcrag. The library’s disuse worked in his favor and he was able to manage, keeping the place organized and assisting the occasional visitors. To his surprise there was still a small trickle of tax money dedicated to the library, which he was eager to spend on fresh books. Instead he found this coin was readily eaten up by his need to hire assistance with the heavier labor, especially since he couldn’t bring himself to accept his mother’s repeated attempts to assist for free. So, his desire for some fresh reading material motivated Varik to bolster his funds by offering teaching and tutoring services when he could. He wasn’t even sure there was demand for it, given Glimcrag’s state of decline. But, a surprising number of families were willing to scrape a little silver together, likely hoping literate children would have more chances to leave town and succeed elsewhere. Even he was surprised to find he had a particular knack for teaching and genuinely enjoyed assisting those who wanted to learn. And with his health, he had a ready supply of excuses to refuse service to problematic clients. He could never take many students at a time, but it was enough to ensure a trickle of fresh material coming to the library.Life continued thus for Varik for roughly a decade: he continued to teach and do what he could to improve what he now considered his library, family continued to ignore him for the most part, and both his health and relationship with his mother continued on their rocky course. He took pride in his work and what independence he had achieved, but a feeling of dissatisfaction and sheer boredom continued to nag him. He couldn’t quash a sensation of being trapped and often fantasized about setting on his own and leaving Glimcrag behind. It was at these times when he least questioned the existence of a curse, for whenever he seriously considered risking travel, his health would take a downward turn and push it out of his reach again.Not long after he turned twenty-nine, events were set into motion that drastically altered the course of Varik’s life. It started with an older woman approaching him in his library with an aged tome for sale. A merchant stopping by was not unusual in and of itself: regulars at the local market would direct traders with books to Varik as a potential buyer. What was strange was her bothering to come by with just a single book asking for a piddling five silver, less than he would expect to pay even for cheap pulp. Odder still was that she seemed a little addled and strangely desperate to make the sale. As soon as he showed any interest and inquired about the nature of the book, she snatched the silver from his hand and hurried out. He was left with the large tome resting on his desk, feeling more confused than upset. Inspecting it, he found its dark violet cover devoid of marking and of strange material, wrinkled and clearly organic, fleshy and almost oily to the touch. Curious, he tried to open it, but found it stubbornly refused to give way. He had been the target of scams before and figured this was another, but was befuddled that she would go through the trouble and ask for only five silver. Dropping it in a drawer and going about his business, he found his thoughts fixating on it through the day. And so, he took it home and set it at his bedside with the intent of inspecting it further. Instead he fell asleep early, and he dreamt.What Varik experienced that night was intense and unearthly, a dream more vivid and lucid than anything he had ever experienced. It began with confusing visions of an otherworldly realm. Varik was acquainted with hallucinogens thanks to past treatments for his conditions, but the experience was bizarre beyond what his own mind had ever produced. Despite the dream’s vividness Varik finds it hard to recall the particulars of what he saw, but he was left with impressions: thick syrupy air, myriad eyes, amorphous structures disregarding gravity, sprawling tendrils of flesh.These visions persisted for what felt like years, though rationality periodically bubbled through the dreaming haze and remind him that was impossible. The landscapes slowly gave way to void, and after a seemingly interminable span the void gave way to an enormous creature. Varik’s head and senses began to clear as he took in the being before him, a fluid assemblage of tendrils and shifting, intelligent eyes, staring intent. They regarded each other for an indeterminate period, Varik knowing he should be terrified while feeling incongruously calm. After a time, the thing spoke, and its voice washed over Varik in a layered stream of nonsense gibbers as it beckoned with its limbs. While Varik distinguished no words, ideas crystallized in his mind. He felt an offer of boons: unearthly power, freedom from bonds, a sense of wholeness. He also sensed a desire for an exchange, for him to be take a new bond and purpose. Intrigued, Varik tried to speak in return, but this only made the vague messages more emphatic. There was no menace to the exchange, only insistence and the strange calm that continued to wash over Varik. Though certain he was dreaming, he couldn’t shake a sense that what was happening was also deeply real. He listened and watched the creature beckon, and he thought. As he thought he became more and more convinced that his thing was in fact offering him a new life, strange as that was, and he couldn’t deny how much he desired such. That isn’t to say the rational part of Varik’s mind wasn’t also reminding him that he should be terrified and that he was crazy to be considering this. But, on a deeper level, he simply didn’t care that it was crazy and sensed this was his only chance at… something big, he wasn’t sure quite what, but something truly life-changing for once. He reached for the closest proffered appendage and grasped it. At this, he abruptly jerked to consciousness, the vast creature giving way to his dimly moonlit bedroom.The calm that had been suffusing Varik gave way immediately to a barrage of emotion, with fear at the forefront as his waking mind rapidly processed what he had just seen. Sweating and shaky in his bed, he slowed his breathing and worked on convincing himself it had been a nightmare. As he did so, he realized that something felt wrong, yet… more right than usual? His breath came far too easily, many aches and pains had vanished, his legs did not feel like his own, and most strangely, something in his very mind felt different, like a new muscle. Lighting a candle, he hesitantly inspected himself and found his deformities gone, and that he could stand up and walk completely naturally, as if he had always been able to.Varik left Glimcrag before dawn and set for Neverwinter, stealing a horse and a few supplies from the manor under cover of night first. He took the tome with him too, sensing its importance. He regretted leaving so abruptly, abandoning all his work at the library, but also felt little desire to explain anything to his family. He knew his mother would be devastated by his disappearance, but any guilt was overridden by a certainty that she would not make it easy for him to leave. His trip to Neverwinter was harrowing, not due to any true danger, but more due to having never ridden a horse or fended for himself before. Eventually he made it, rattled and saddle sore, but with enough money to rent a room at the inn.Several weeks passed for Varik in Neverwinter. It didn’t take him long to realize that he had acquired more than a stronger constitution. First he found that he could speak without words, though his first accidental use of that ability taught him to be mindful of his stray thoughts. He also found that there was much more to the tome, which now opened to his touch. It did not contain any language he was familiar with, but after a brief study of its pages he felt an intuitive knowledge of how to tap into and manipulate a reservoir of arcane energy now within himself. He soon mastered his first spells and noted that they seemed a little… different from the standard fare of apprentice wizards.Varik spent most of his time seeking to understand what had happened to him, selling the horse to sustain his research. He felt no small amount of fear that there had to be a cost attached to what was gained, recalling the creature had beckoned for an exchange. After that encounter his sleep had been frequently disturbed by similar unearthly visions, but they unfortunately provided no clarification. He scoured Neverwinter’s library, much larger than his own had been, studying tomes about magic, deities, and the planes in hopes of learning the nature of the being he had bargained with. He found no mention of anything like what he had seen. What he did find were accounts of other bargains for arcane magic, usually referred to as pacts. Such stories inevitably ended badly for the pactmaker, with a Devil acquiring their soul or a Fey lady abducting a firstborn. While these stories offered little insight, they made him uneasy, and he worried he had done something that was at best taboo and at worst extremely dangerous.Varik’s time in Neverwinter came to an end when he caught wind of a reward being offered for the whereabouts of a crippled half-elf matching his description. While his improved condition greatly reduced the chance of someone making the connection, Varik took this as his cue to leave town, feeling his research had hit a dead end. A demonstration of the destructive bolts his magic could produce easily netted him a job guarding a caravan to Phandelver. He figured the pay would be adequate to find transport further south, perhaps to Baldur’s Gate. His destiny proved much more complex after goblins attacked the caravan and he and his fellow guards found themselves embroiled in events in Phandelver."9/18/2017 3:03:04,Francis Embercrumb,Half-Elf,Sorcerer,"From his birth Francis lived as a servant to Lord Archibald Embercrumb and Lady Edwina Embercrumb, in the grand Embercrumb Manor situated in the upper class district of the city of Eaglestone. Eaglestone, which has long acted as a city of magical advancement, is a home to some of the greatest families of Wizards in history, and the Embercrumb family is no exception. Lord Archibald Embercrumb is famous throughout Eaglestone, and the surrounding areas, for his personal contributions to advancing the arcane arts, as well as for his blood lines excellent mastery of Pyro magics. Francis, at the time named Dribble, greatly admired Lord Archibald for his history, but he admired him even more for his character, while he hated to think of it, Dribble was of mixed blood, ""the product of a moment of animal lust between a human and lowly elf woman"" Lady Edwina would always say. This was always a source of shame for him, as such he has always kept his hair long enough to cover his long ears. His mixed blood made Dribble an outsider in Eaglestone, which was mostly populated by humans, spare for the odd elf slave owned by the more affluent families. Despite this Lord Archibald had always shown Dribble a level of respect and consideration that he rarely saw from anyone else in the city, this came as a stark comparison to Lady Edwina, who showed now restraint in proclaiming her distaste for other ""lesser"" races. Because of this Dribble had always been confused as to why Lady Edwina kept him present in the manor as her servant. No matter how hard he tried, she could find fault in everything he did, he would spend hours cleaning the kitchen but she would still find a speck of dirt to scold him over. At times it felt as though this transcended her mere animosity for elves, and became a focused resentment toward him, although he couldn't think of what he had done to deserve this. He once asked Lord Archibald why she harboured this loathing for him and the Lord merely scoffed, stating ""as with many women who marry for fame and fortune, they grow into venomous hags in later life"". While this did slightly ease Dribbles concern he also felt sad for the Lord and Lady, while he rarely became involved in personal conversations with either of them, he knew they would be wed for 45 years in the coming months, surely not all relationships were doomed to failure? Dribble suspected that this divide between the Lord and Lady could be linked to the loss of their son, Francis. Whenever distant relatives would travel to the manor, conversation would often turn to this ""lost son of Embercrumb"". No one ever specified what ""lost"" meant but the fact that the Lord and Lady never spoke of their son made Dribble believe he was likely dead, what other explanation could there be? While questions of the lost son of Embercrumb and Lady Edwina's almost unreasonable disgust for him bemused Dribble, there was another question that filled his thoughts even more as he aged, who were his parents? The question would nag in the back of his mind each day, so much so that he felt compelled to confront the Lord and Lady on the matter of how he came to be in their service, Lady Edwina was noticeably rattled by the question but before she could mount an answer Lord Archibold spoke, ""My boy, we know very little regarding your parents, while out in the city one day we found you abandoned and concerned for your life we brought you back here. We tried to find any trace of who your parents may be and contacted the local authorities, but we received no comforting response. As such we felt you would be better here with us than growing up in an orphanage."" He still recalls how hearing those words made his heart feel like it was sinking down through his body, and witnessing the slowly collapsing relationship between the Lord and Lady did little to raise his spirits. Did his parents grow to hate each other and leave Dribble in Eagleston as they didn't want a reminder of each other? Or was Lady Edwina right, had they simply been two lovers passing in the night, never giving thought to what their passion could bring? When he was younger these thoughts deflated Dribble, but as he grew older his strict and cold upbringing had instilled and early maturity in him. He had now accepted his lot in life, and could at least take comfort in the fact that unlike some men and women in the world he had a roof over his head and hot food to fill his belly, at least it was hot when Lady Edwina granted him enough oil to cook himself a warm meal. Despite his acceptance of his circumstances though, it didn't stop him pondering on the matter. Time passed quickly in the manor, a regular schedule of collecting groceries and cleaning were the main roles Dribble was trusted with. Shortly after turning 15 he was asked to assist the head cook of the manor in the Kitchen, this quickly ended however as one day when working with the hob it erupted with an overwhelming flame that singed the ceiling and the hairs of the head cook, Mr. Rumpletilt. Dribble was knocked back from the sheer force of the blast, and was so shaken that he didn't notice being dragged upstairs my Mr Rumpletilt and being berated by Lady Edwina, before being sent to bed with no supper. That night he lay in bed thinking of what had happened, he recalled the words of Mr Rumpletilt, ""The damn boy must've put too much coal and kindling in before lightning the hob, we're all bloomin lucky he didn't blow the manor sky high"", but that couldn't have been what happened ... Dribble had put in the least amount of coal need and only just lit the match for the hob, or had he overloaded it and not noticed? He didn't waste long on these thoughts though, as a week later he heard the only news that make his sad little existence seem worse, through the almost incoherent blubbering of Lady Edwina Dribble understood that Lord Archibald Embercrumb, the head of this house, did not have long to live. While Dribble knew the Lord was much older than the lady, he never asked by how much, and while he noticed a slow but steady decline in how active the Lord was never thought this would happen. As the words sank into him he was reminded of that day he asked about his parents, and felt that same sinking feeling that he hoped never to feel again. Over the next month Dribble blankly continued his tasks around the manor, each day different doctors would visit, but they would always leave in the same way, standing by the door shaking their head with Lady Edwina holding her head in her hands. As his final days grew closer the Lord requested a strangely greater number of visits from little Dribble, he would speak to him for hours about his journeys in his youth, the places he went to and the people he met, each time he would end the story saying, ""One day my boy, I hope you will do the same."" The only thing Dribble hoped for, was that the Lord wouldn't leave him. Sadly though, on a stormy night a few weeks later, Lord Archibald summoned Dribble to his bed side for one last time, as he entered the room Lady Edwina was there as well as some of the other men and women who worked in the manor, there was also a strange man in a black suit who Dribble recognised from visiting the manor before. When he first saw him he thought he must be a doctor, however after Dribble arrived he produced some documents which he quickly began to read. It was now obvious that he was in fact lawyer here to read the Lords will. He spoke with a cold and sharp voice, clearly showing his experience in such events, ""I Lord Archibald Embercrumb, of sounds mind and body, hereby leave all my monetary assets, including my manor in Eaglestone to my wife, Lady Edwina Embercrumb"" upon hearing the words the Lady collapsed blubbering again, Dribble knew this was as to be expected, who else would he leave his great wealth to? However strangely the man continued, ""However, should my son ever return to the manor, all assets will instantly go to him, including ownership of the manor and any wealth still remaining after my wife has had access to it. That is all."" There was a brief and awkward pause, Lady Edwina's blubbering halted immediately and turned to something closer to rage, ""What do you mean 'all assets will go to him!?"" she cried. The lawyer calmly looked at her with his cold almost lifeless eyes, ""As it says, should your son ever return the manor will belong to him, the Lord wished for the house to remain with his bloodline if it can, as it has done for generations."" Following Lady Edwina's outburst, Lord Embercrumb had raised himself in his bed and looked upon those around in him his final moments, ""Do you have a problem with this my dear?"" he said in a commanding voice. ""...No, not at all my love, I was just surprised as we never discussed this"", the Lady sheepishly replied, ""No I suppose we did not, now all of you leave me."" and with that Lord Archibald slowly sank back in to the soft silk bed linens covering him, ""Except for you Dribble, you stay."" Dribble felt an overwhelming mix of emotions, from sadness over the situation to joy that he would get to speak to his Lord one last time. The men and women slowly stepped out of the bedroom, all the while Dribble could feel the harsh glare of Lady Edwina on him, he didn't know why the Lord wanted to speak to him alone but he was sure it wouldn't do him any favours tomorrow, when the Lady would be his only master, but for now he would enjoy this moment. The only source of light in the room was a flickering candle on the Lords bed side table, and as Dribble slid a stool closer to Archibald, the light revealed a man he barely recognised, the frail and withered man lying in front of him barely resembled the great man he spent so much time with just months before, it was a harsh reminder that no man can escape time. ""My Lord, I am grateful you would want to speak with me and allow me a chance to say goodbye, but surely you would want to spend this time with your wife, Lady Edwina?"" Dribble said, Archibald softened his demeanor and smiled, ""You have always thought of others boy, I would like to say you got it from my side of the family but considering the Embercrumb family history it must be from your mother..."" he coughed lightly as the words left his mouth. Dribble smiled, but as the words slowly sank into him the smile changed into a look that could only be described as bemused, ""I am sorry Lord, but your side of the family? You must be feeling much worse than the others thought, as it sounds like you're suggesting I am part of the Embercrumb family."" Lord Archibald's face turned very serious, ""Did it now? Well I suppose that would be because that it is the truth."" Again this bizarre serious of words only made Dribble feel confused, ""My Lord you are not making any sense, let me fetch the doctor for"", ""Sit down and listen lad, I don't have much time left as I am sure you can tell. Now over there by the fire place there is an old oak chest with brass fittings, you're still young so bring it here could you?"" As always Dribble, did not hesitate to do as his master ordered, he did not know how to act between his sense of confusion, sorrow and guilt that the Lord was clearly so deranged and he could do nothing. He slowly dragged the chest near the bed and sat back down on his stool, Lord Archibald pushed himself up to be sitting to get a good view of the chest in the dimly lit room. ""Excellent, thank you my boy, now here please open the chest"" he slowly slid his hand into the top buttons of night gown around his neck, and as the hand retracted it was holding a key tied to a chain around his neck. He slipped the chain and key over his head and passed it to Dribble, ""My Lord I am not sure why you want me to do this.."", ""All will become clear once you open the chest."" And so Dribble took the key to the chest but now found something even more confusing, ""My Lord, I am sorry, but this chest has no lock on it ... I don't know how to open it."" A wry smile slowly stretched across Archibald's face, ""well of course it has no lock, it's a magic chest, enchanted so that only a son of the Embercrumb family can open it."" There he went again, suggesting that Dribble, a lowly half elf, was a son of the great Embercrumb family, ""My Lord please, lay down and rest you're making yourself worse"", ""Worse!? I have not felt this happy in years, happy and ashamed, you see you may not believe it, but you are my Grandson and you will open that chest!"" ""But how?"" Dribble replied, tears beginning to well in his eyes over the stress of the situation, ""By using magic, your magic, the same magic you used when you caused that accident in the kitchen a few months ago."" Upon hearing those words Dribble's whole body went cold, an icy chill spread from his head down to his toes, was this true? Did he use magic to cause that accident? His head was rapidly filling with questions but Archibald was urging him on to open the chest and he didn't want to disappoint him. He turned and leant down towards the chest, ""I still don't understand, how should I open it if there is no lock?"", ""Relax and it should become clear"" Lord Archibald replied in a reassuring tone, and so, Dribble calmed himself and looked toward the chest, hoping for something, anything to happen and then suddenly something did. A strange shimmer began to distort the space near the front of the chest, it warped and twisted the contact between the lid and base making distinction between the two impossible, and just as quickly as the warping began it started to reverse, now with a silver glow at the centre. As the chest began to look normal again Dribble recognised what looked like a lock proudly emerging at the front. He stared in amazement, obviously living in Eaglestone Dribble has seen magic before, but never this close, and never anything so mesmerising. Archibald already knew that Dribble had witnessed the chests transformation, ""Well go on my boy, open it"" he said with a faint sense of glee. Dribble held out the key between his fingers with its head facing the lock, his hand began to shake as he slid the key into the hollow space at the locks centre and just as the key was fully submerged. the chest suddenly swung open with incredible force. Inside it revealed many large books which had clearly been read multiple times, a tattered robe and cloak and an envelope bearing the wax seal of the Embercrumb family, a beautiful phoenix bathed in flames. The envelope had a name written on it, 'To Francis', it said, a name Dribble did not need help remembering, ""My Lord is this letter for your lost son?"", Archibald smiled and replied, ""No my boy, this letter is for my Grandson, and that is his true name although he has not used it since birth. My Grandson, a half human, half-elf, who has lived long enough to know the truth. That letter is for you, Francis."" At a time like this you would imagine a wave of mixed emotions washing over you, for Dribble, now Francis, the truth was he felt nothing. It was as if the overwhelming situation had caused a block in him, he couldn't even comprehend the words Archibald had said, he just knelt staring at the letter sitting atop all other contents of the chest. He felt an urge inside him, drawing him to that letter, it was as if the moment he saw it he knew, he knew it was meant for him, and so slowly and carefully he picked it up and began to break its seal. As Francis lifted open the envelope and removed the letter inside Lord Archibald could only sit and watch in silence, he wanted to say something, anything, but he knew that letter would explain the situation far better than he could now. And so he waited as Francis unfolded the paper he now held and began to read it, a letter from father to son. 'To my dear Francis, If you are reading this then I am so very sorry, sorry that I was not with you to explain all of this in person. I had hoped that I would have returned by now, but where I am heading and what I am doing doesn't allow for an accurate guess at when I may return. As I am sure your Grandfather, my father, has now explained, you are indeed the youngest son of the Embercrumb family, the latest in a long line of powerful wizards. I hope you can one day find it in your heart to forgive me and your Grandparents for keeping this from you since your birth, for now I cannot explain why we did this, but please understand that it was for your own protection. I hope that one day you and I can meet so that I may explain to you in person why I had to leave, and why I had to keep your identity a secret even from you, if you are reading this letter though the time has come for you to begin learning how to master the magic that is in your blood. I know you have no reason to do as I ask, but as your father I implore you to heed my directions, as soon as you are able you must travel far east to visit an old wizard named Cornelius Zumbrage, he taught me magic and studied with your Grandfather when they were younger. He is a man unlike anything you have experienced before, but know he is at his core a kind and generous man. The times ahead may be hard but take comfort in the knowledge that your mother and I loved your dearly and did not want this life for you, I am sure you have many questions about who and where she is but the sad truth is that your mother passed away when you were born. Her name was Gloria Thinderween, I wish you could have known her, she was the most gentle and beautiful creature that has ever existed and as I write this letter the pain of losing her is almost too much to bare. The only thing keeping me moving now is the thought that you will grow up safe and I may one day see you again. Please stay safe my son, seek out Cornelius as soon as you can and trust no-one until you speak with him. Your Father, Francis Embercrumb, the First.'"9/18/2017 18:58:07,Ernest Mendax,Half-elf ,Bard,"He was born in a human refugee camp.

He knew nothing beyond this toilsome life until a group of traveling missionaries passed through town, healing the sick and performing small miracles. While he was not terribly bright, Gra-Donk saw the happiness that each small bit of divine magic provided. Then and there, he decided that he was to be of the clergy, though he didn't know what that actually meant. Nor did he know which god -- he's always getting their names wrong. But it was one of the good ones, he knew that much. As soon as he was capable, he left the village to seek out the wrongs of the world and bring to them a light such as only a true-hearted believer could provide.

Instead of picking up a warhammer, he would often play with the forge his Orc mother ran, hitting the different pipes and metal bits to make fun songs. He was also talkative. Very talkative. So much so that his mother and father once took him out to the beach to give him a pet. When he said he wanted a seagull, his parents took as many as they could find, tied them to strings, tied the strings to his backpack, and watched as they flew away on a gust of wind. Of course, Bork saw this as an accident, after all, who could ever hate Bork? As Bork soared through the skies, he witnessed true beauty. He saw the colors of the sunset from above the mountain-tops, he heard the songs of the birds in the trees, he witnessed the motion of the ocean dancing its eternal dance. From then on, Bork dedicated his life to two things: the Funk, the feeling that he got whenever he witnessed true beauty and passion in his groovy projects, and finding his family.

Rhea has since heard rumours that he is actually her father by blood and that he had cheated on his wife with Rhea's mother. While Rhea's sister, Clara, was accepted into studying as a wizard under the town council's programme for gifted magic users, and would likely one day become an advising wizard to the royal family, Rhea learnt to use herbs and create poultices and look after people who got injured down at the docks. It didn't take long for her patients to realise that she had a quite literal 'magic touch', and was able to heal people much faster than should have been possible. The town's clerics and priests recognised her ability to heal as a cleric's healing magic, but could not detect any touch of their gods in her. Searching for knowledge about this gift from an unknown god, Rhea left home at adulthood and travelled the country healing people on the way and looking for information about forgotten gods. She sends any money she makes back to Clara and her adopted parents, and visits whenever her travels allow her to return."9/17/2017 23:30:28,Rivinka Dierik,Half-orc,Sorcerer,"Rivinka Dierik is the bastard child of Dmitri Dierik, a nobleman wizard hippie nerd with very little regard for actual noble-ing and a lot of interest in collecting ancient magical artifacts of dubious origin, and Urthaga the Unseen, the Blade That Sings Of Twilight - an orc rogue and right hand to the leader of one of the many orc tribes in the northern steppes.Fate made her parents paths cross under circumstances Rivinka is not fully aware; all she knows is that, for a while, her mother's tribe and father's adventuring party shared a common goal, and perhaps a common enemy. After that, Urthaga and Dmitri retired to a quiet tower near the village of Riverrun, where she was born and raised.Since her youth, Rivinka had strange, dark magic, very different than that of her father; she enjoyed an affinity to shadows, and could hear whispers of the dead, being herself not quite alive for hours at a time. What caused her shadow sorcery to manifest is unknown, and it made her grow up isolated and unconnected to the world around her, as father and mother were her only company - until later in life, when she had learned to control her magic, being in cities and around large gatherings of the living made her sick.She learned as much as she could from her parents, and despite the oddities was a capable, well-educated, intelligent and polite girl.However, a strange woman arrived at the tower during a bright and sunny summer solstice morning, and whisked away her mother before she could notice; her father spent the following seven years sullen and sulking, until Riv's sixteenth birthday, when he brougnt her to the topmost level of his tower, where all his most precious magical artifacts were.He gave her his cape and hat, as well as money, equipment, and a daunting task: to find her mother, wherever she may be.He told her that letting her mother go had been a mistake, and that he needed Riv to find her and reunite the family, as he was too old and frail to go search for her himself. Stating that there was no time to lose, he hugged her, wished her luck, made her promise she would come back with her mother, and then zapped her via teleport spell to the city where our story begins."9/18/2017 17:37:02,Tiakbois,Half-Orc,Barbarian/Alchemist,"Tiaka Odilopir lived to hunt, roam the wilderness, and battle the hated Orcs of Belkzen with her fellow warriors of her Ustalavian tribe. In all, she led a carefree life until a battle against the cunning Empty Hand Orcs went very wrong. Briefly at her foes' mercy, she suffered the worst humiliation that a warrior can. The Empty Hand were driven off and Tiaka rescued, but the demon spirits of her tribe had already punished her for her weakness.	Tiaka bore her punishment with stoicism, but still wanted to make the child within her somehow worthy of her bloodline despite its Orcish taint. She prayed ceaselessly to her clan's demon totem, begging that its power would enter her and overshadow her baby's Orcish corruption.	Tiakbos was born under the least auspicious heavenly signs possible and with a full set of fangs more fiendish than Orcish, but his mother drew encouragement from these signs that her prayers had been answered. Now that he is grown, Tiakbos feels the demon spirit's hold on him growing, and lives in terror of the few horrible seconds each day when the fiend takes control and alters his very flesh. But those seconds are growing longer, and he fears that if he does not gain mastery over the totem under which he was born, that it will one day fully rule him.	After searching far and wide for a cure to no avail, Tiakbos followed rumors that certain alchemical infusions could suppress a person's darkest urges. If he could not escape the demon, then at least he would steer its energies to be used on his own terms. It mostly works, except when the demon overcomes the drugs and adds the mutagen's strength to its own.	Tiakbos is a man without a place in life. He cannot go back to his mother's tribe for fear of how they will use his totemic strength, and the ways of the bloodthirsty Orcs would prove just as tempting to the beast within him. So he keeps his head down, moving from place to place in search of new alchemical texts to study, hoping that his muscles, sharp teeth, and array of Orc weapons salvaged from battlefields will be enough warning to make people leave him alone. It's for their own good.	Tiakbos is as tall and as powerful as any Half-Orc, but he tends to hunch over to avoid notice. While not unattractive, he is very quiet and a wallflower. This is not due to shyness, but out of desire to avoid stressful situations that will make his inner demonic beast come forth. Unfortunately, Tiakbos also cannot abide the sight of wrongdoing and those who won't stop bullying others following a stern warning often find themselves facing the slashing teeth that slide forth from his mouth and the horns that erupt without warning from his head."9/18/2017 16:43:43,Gurak,Half-Orc,Barbarian,"Gurak was the son of a well-respected Warboss among the Orc tribes. His mother was a human, however unlike most human women in the tribe, she was not a slave, she was actually the of wife the Warboss Gorguts, Gurak's father. Gurak's tribe was a collection of Orcs, Goblins, Hobgoblins and Ogres. They were a tribe of pseudo-pirates, they would constantly raid other villages via sea, and plunder trade routes and merchant ships for food, gold and weapons. However, Gorguts was tired of the tribes warring with one another and raiding. He wanted a more prosperous future for the Orc tribes, so he began attempting to unite all Orc tribes to stop them from constantly warring with one another and focus on becoming a functioning society rather than a collection of savage tribes attacking and pillaging the innocents of the world, and each other. Gurak really liked the idea of the Orc tribes becoming a functioning society that could possibly have relations with other civilised locations. However, some of the Orcs in the tribe were unhappy with this decision and would rather continue being marauders. Most of these Orcs were strong worshippers of Gruumsh. Gurak's older brother, Bruz, was one of the few Orcs who wanted to continue to rampage across the land. Bruz is full Orc, not Half-Orc like Gurak.One day, Gurak, Bruz, and Gorguts went out to hunt a large Owlbear that had killed a group of scouts from the tribe. After they successfully hunted and killed the Owlbear, Bruz turned around and murdered their father in cold blood before attempting to kill Gurak. Leaving Gurak badly wounded, Bruz returned to their stronghold and told the tribe that both Gorguts and Gurak were killed by the Owlbear. Gurak managed to survive his injuries and returned to the stronghold only to find his brother had become the new Warboss. He wanted to return to the ways of old, marauding other towns and villages, murdering every other tribe that there was, instead of trying to unite them like their father wanted. Most of the tribe were content with this decision and Bruz started sending out war parties to raid other tribes. Gurak was not happy that his brother betrayed him and his father so he abandoned the tribe and began wandering, seeking a more dutiful purpose. After wandering for months on end, alone, he came across a young Gnome Druid out in the forest named Bimble. The two travelled together for some time looking after each other, Gurak kept the two safe from dangerous wildlife or the occasional bandit while Bimble kept them both healthy and fed. She also taught Gurak how to properly control his anger, and only unleash it when necessary. Gurak is very focused on completing any task he's given, except if Bimble is in danger, in which case he will abandon the mission to keep her safe. Now he just travels wherever she goes because he has no other purpose."9/18/2017 8:59:31,"Grosk ""Cookie""",Half-orc,Witch (Sea witch archetype),"Grosk was raised in orc society, and poorly treated due to his weak nature. One of the tribe's shamans took him in as he proved himself quick witted and clever. This was no respite however, as the training of a shaman's apprentice is a brutal one. Beatings and ritual scarification are the norm, in an effort to 'toughen up' the normally weak casters. Grosk, while clever, picked up some alchemy but had no talent for divine magic. So one night, he stole a few supplies and headed for human lands. Half-orcs are rarely welcomed, so Grosk kept having to move from town to town, never having a place to call home. One day however, he found his salvation. While languishing in the seedier side of a port town, he spotted a pair of half-orc sailors in a bar, sharing a drink with their crewmates. The image stirred a hope in him, that finally there was an egalitarian place to be. The sea. On the ship, a man's worth was based on his skill and not the circumstances of his birth. He made some inquiries, and eventually was signed on to a trade ship as a novice hand and assistant cook.For 20 years Grosk, now ""Cookie"", worked on ships. Seeing the world, but never being much part of it, the sea was his home.One fateful day, when he was now firmly in middle age, a violent storm capsized his ship. Cookie was never a good swimmer, and being trapped below deck as the waters rushed in, he knew he was doomed. One last prayer to any gods who could save him, and he blacked out.Cookie awoke on a beach, wracked with pain, and vision swimming, his eyes landed on a tiny group of odd circles in a tidepool. ""Bubbles?"" He said, to the slowly focusing image, as he reached out. The bubbles moved, and grabbed onto his hand with 8 tiny tentacles. The blue-ringed octopus climbed up his arm and looked him right in the eyes, it was then that Cookie knew some power had saved him, and this creature was to be his bond to that power.Cookie started to feel his age creeping up on him, and decided to try and find a permanent place to settle. The idea of heading back out to sea, after losing so many friends just didn't sit well, so once again, Grosk wandered. It was harder this time around though, as his powers and familiar required him to stay close to the sea, he had to move from seaside town to seaside town, where the superstitions of the locals would eventually drive him out. This made him more reclusive, and drove him to expand his powers as a means of protecting himself. The shipwreck and constant moving also taught him several lessons: First, that wealth is only good if you can take it with you, so he invests in magic items that are easily portable.Second, that power is best when kept hidden. So he dresses like a beggar, in clothes that look like they just washed ashore.Third, that compassion is fine, but when the chips are down, everyone looks out for themselves.Fourth, that the pursuit of power is it's own reward, and worth crossing the taboos of the weak and superstitious.Eventually, his wanderings brought him to a place where he might find sanctuary. A cosmopolitan port city, run by a pirate government trying to gain legitimacy. Emberdale."9/18/2017 11:35:35,"""Soupy"" Güdfre",Half-Orc,Wizard,"_G’thnur Brighim, chief of the Thagan Clan of the Skybreaker Hordes, led a raiding party on the southern fringes of the United City-States of Praegotbet. While attacking a small village there, he took Nole Gu_dfre as a captive. Usually, the captives of G’thnur would be treated as his personal playthings for a time and executed when he felt no more fun from them. Nole Gu_dfre, however, was able to tap into some form of kindness from the Thagan chief, appealing to his old age and lack of an heir, once she was pregnant. G’thnur released Nole back to her village, where she gave birth to his child. G’thnur insisted that the child not be named until he was old enough to speak and returned to his clan.Nole became a briefly best selling author when she wrote an adventurous memoir of her time with the Thagan clan, _Life With Ug_ly Savages. G’thnur would return periodically to help raise his Half-Orc son, unable to read her memoir because he refused to learn the “Tiny-Man-Speak” of Common.The child would be traded from Nole’s village in Praegotbet back to G’thnur’s encampment. With Nole, she used the wealth from her memoirs to have the child properly educated, where he would develop an obsession with the Arcane, wanting to become among the elite Mages of Praegobet. With the Thagan Clan, the boy learned how to survive amongst tougher opponents and participate in the melees of Orc culture.Once the boy was forming proper sentences in both Orc and Common, G’thnur announced to the clan that his name would harken back to the ancestral Orcs, naming the boy Thawginautaut’Frawbuyitfuh’Musulu’alG’thnur. During that same naming ceremony, a drunken G’thnur recounted the story of Thawginautaut’Frawbuyitfuh’Musulu’alG’thnur’s birth, describing how the aftermath was a “disgustingly soupy mess all over the hut.” The nickname stuck across the Thagan encampment. The Gu_dfre boy returned home to his mother and informed her that his name was “Soupy.”“Soupy” was eventually accepted to the Academy of the Arcane, Praegobet’s leading arcane college. He took up a major in Arcane Research to study the effects of the Arcane, as he himself had no magical ability. (Despite Nole’s decent wealth, the Academy was an expensive school, which led to the 400,000gp loans that haunt “Soupy” even now.)During an anthropology class in his senior year, “Soupy” and his class were participating in a dig to explore Praegobet’s history before the Flower War. While digging through the side of a hill, an errant strike of a pickaxe from one of the students sent a wave of magical energy pulsing through the cave, followed closely by an explosion and subsequent cave-in.When “Soupy” awoke, a tattoo of Tribal Arcane Runes snakes up his arm and to his shoulder, and he found that he could cast magic spells through these runes. His high school graduation ring had been transformed by the magical energy, warped and enchanted to become his Ring of Lost Memories. Academy officials (Praegobet G-Men) informed “Soupy” that he was being removed from the Academy, as to distance Praegobet from a compromising situation involving the explosion, death of students, and confirmation of magic thought extinct.“Soupy” was able to plead his case as a student of the Arcane. The Academy allowed him the opportunity to work on his Thesis (T_ he Ecological Effects of Prolonged Arcana Exposure to Various Ecosystems), with the caveat that only if the Thesis was considered passing would he be able to continue earning his place among the Inner Mage Circle.With just enough of a grant to catch a boat to Kara-Tur, “Soupy” set off to begin field research for his Thesis."9/17/2017 21:26:27,Kazimir Voronin,half-orc,barbarian,"The wizened orc leaned closer to the fire, reflections dancing along the copper caps on his tusks. Young humans, orcs, and half-orcs of the Ghirak clan noticed, and turned their attention to the tribal elder, knowing that a story was coming. The elder took a long sip of some dark liquid, smelling of the sour berries of the hinterlands, and then began.“This is for you young ones, who look out into the world and want to know your place in it, for this is a story of one much like yourselves, who is still writing his story as we tell it here. Young Kazimir was born in this very village twenty-one years ago, a strong half-orc born to Dragomir and Lyudmila. The stars and signs aligned when he came into the world, and the shamans noticed. They read the knots in the kryta root and listened to the wind voices, and knew that he was chosen by the spirits of the world. Soon enough he was inducted into the shamanic order, bound to keep them safe against the many dangers that our tribe faces.“By his 16th year Kazimir had proven himself as a warrior of repute. He had bested Orc challengers from the south, and helped Grand Shaman Zvonimir conduct the Midwinter’s Rite. This was of course, some years after the cursed Irrilians came up from the south and were pushing us further and further into the mountains.At the mention of the Irrilians, older listeners grumbled and barked. The young ones, who had only known Korna after the initial invasion, frowned but did not have the same level of revulsion as those who remembered the heady pre-invasion days.“At the Grand Shaman’s command, Kazimir went on raiding parties against Irrilian army camps with the war parties. As a member of the shamans, he was somewhat of an outsider to the proud hunters, but they knew his uses--when in combat, Kazimir could lead the rage of the trampled land forth, and crush the Irrilians like snow under our boots. It is said also that the Grand Shaman sometimes sent Kazimir with special instructions. Sometimes it was to gather gem dust for a seeing-ritual. Or to take the scalps of three Southerners for blood rites. Or to find details on the Irrilian’s magics.“In the early spring of 539 IE, Kazimir was sent out once more to infiltrate and destroy an encampment set up by the Irrilian empire. This was after the imperial palace burned in fire, and their forces were scattered in defeat. This one encampment still stood, however, and it was an insult to our people for it to sully our lands so. The Grand Shaman told Kazimir to go into the central tent and to retrieve an object for study.“We don’t know what Kazimir was sent to find. We do know that he brought it back in great secrecy and carried it to the Grand Shaman, who summoned other shamans and guardians for a secret conference. Three days later, when the full moon aligned with Kyzor’s Sickle in the sky, they all went up to the peak of Koshtan-Kazbek, for some secret spell. We do not know what it was intended to do, but we know the results. All in the village woke, for it was as if night became day. There was a terrific blast at the top of the mountain, and a rain of ash fell across the slopes.“Only Kazimir came back from that dread ritual. He would not say what occurred, bound by the oaths of his order. He said that Grand Shaman Zvonimir was now guiding him through the world, to right what was wrong, though scouts confirmed that Zvonimir was nowhere to be found. Left with little choice, our Chief banished Kazimir for sabotage of holy rites.The expulsion of a member from the tribe is, of course, the most feared fate of the average Ghirakan, and thus many of the young listeners gasped, whereas older ones grimaced.“Was Kazimir a traitor? Did he bring back a cursed artifact from the Irrilian camp? Why did he survive where elder guardians and shamans died or disappeared? These questions weighed heavily on the elders. Kazimir was ironclad in his assertion that he was following the Grand Shaman’s orders, as always, and that he was on a sacred mission. As such it was with a heavy heart and much doubt that he was banished into the world.“There is a curious fact that was noticed by Lyudmila, Kazimir’s mother and scout for the clan. A strange tattoo appeared on Kazimir’s face when he returned from the peak, the shape of which had not been seen before. The same mark was seen burned into the cap of Koshtan-Kazbek, as if by great fire. It looked like this:_When asked what this was, Kazimir was cryptic, saying only that it was also known as U+0F04, which made no sense to anyone.“So Kazimir set out into the wider world, with only his sacred weapon, a strange mark, and the guidance of a disappeared mentor to show him the way. I hope that he is guided well--there are strange times ahead, and Ghirak will need heroes to defend it."9/18/2017 9:06:29,Pogranax,Half-Orc,Fighter,"Pogranax was born a bastard in the harsh landscapes of Kellid. His mother was a victim of a brutal attack from an Orc tribe, in which her husband was killed and she was forced to conceive at the hands of one of the strongest warriors in the raiding party. While she was not the only woman subjected to this brutality that day, she was the only one to carry her child full term and give birth.As a boy, Pogranax (or ""Pog,"" as he was called) was never entirely accepted around the village, much because he was a constant reminder of the atrocities that many there had suffered through. He was prone to fights with other kids, which he typically won, even when outnumbered.Instead of choosing to focus on the negative of his conception, his mother Alais focused on the fact that he was her son. Her husband had ever been able to give her a child in their brief years of marriage. Knowing that many of her neighbors would struggle to accept him, she worked to help the boy establish his identity and accept himself, even going so far as to give him a name which she felt reflected his strong Orc heritage.Pogranax was the quick to volunteer for the village watch, eager to prove himself loyal to his human family. Due to his larger stature, he had learned to fight using blunted broadswords before the other boys his age could even pick one up. Granted, he used both hands, but to him the use of a powerful blow from both shoulders felt natural.Years had passed since the last major attack on the village, since a wall of raw lumber poles reinforced with stones had been erected to keep the majority of the attacks out. When the large attack had come, the second since Pogranax had been born, it was a fierce battle.In the middle of the fighting, Pogranax spotted a large orc warrior swinging a hammer at several defending villagers. The head of the weapon was larger than a melon, and tended to explode the heads of the villagers like melons when it made contact. He fought with fury and passion like Pogranax had never seen, and despite loathing him as an enemy, he respected him as a fighter. Despite facing his own enemies, the young half-orc kept an eye on the situation as he made his way into the town square, where the large orc warrior roared and smashed. As armored men kept their distance, bolts from several crossbows pierced the orc's arm and side. Still, he fought on, but as the blood continued to pour, it was obvious that the barbarian was getting weaker. His swings came slower and slower as the wounds fatigued him. Pogranax finally reached the edge of the circle around the orc, and brought his own large weapon up defensively in front of him.The orc in the middle turned, keeping the village soldiers at bay. As his gaze fell on Pogranax, the half-orc got his first good look at the blood-thirsty brute, and the ground seemed to drop out from beneath his feet. Above the orc's right eye was a large, crescent-shaped scar, his left cheek also scarred by four thin parallel lines. Growing up, his mother had been honest about his lineage.*******""Pogranax, I want you to know where you come from,"" she had told him. ""You cannot hide who you are, but I want you to feel comfortable in your own skin. I do not know who your real father is.""""They attacked at night. We heard the fighting outside. I told Habastad to join the other men, but he stayed to protect me. It wasn't long before he---your real father---burst in the door, letting out a terrible roar. I screamed, and I think it encouraged him. I could see the bodies of dead village guards through the open door behind the orc warrior.""""Habastad, may the Lord in Iron favor him, did his best to defend me, but he was no match. He threw the blow from his axe right at the orc's head, using both hands. While the blade cut through the skin, it bounced off his thick skull, leaving a gaping wound in the shape of the crescent moon. I could see the bone beneath the hanging skin, but the orc just wiped the blood out of his right eye, licking it off his own hand. As Habastad brought his axe up for a second attack, the orc swung his own large weapon. I didn't get a good look at what it was, but it was large and blunt.""Her eyes, staring off in the distances of memory, always began tearing up at this point. ""Many things about that night still give me bad dreams and invite the night hag to whisper in my ear, but the sound---that gut-wrenching sound---still haunts me. It was like breaking a bundle of twigs over your knee, but instead, they were bones. Habastad's ribs, actually, as his body was slammed into the wall. He had fallen to the ground, unable to breathe, unable to get up, but he was still alive.""At this point, she was typically sobbing. ""I'll never forget Habastad's eyes, wide and watching as the orc warrior forced me to the floor and cut at my clothing with a filthy knife. They were full of despair, despair and regret, as if he'd failed me. He had done his best, he had to have known that, but the orc was just too massive. The orc had forced himself on me then. I screamed again, but he only laughed. I was able to get my right arm free at one point, and struck at his left eye with all of my fury. He flinched, but I still managed to get him with my fingernails, leaving trails of blood down the left side of his face."" Alais' voice would harden with resolve as she told this part, but would eventually fade off as she concluded. ""That finally did it. I thought he was going to kill me, and at that point, I welcomed it. I saw him lean back, but that was the last thing I remember. He must have punched me, and very hard, because it was close to mid-day by the time I awoke. Habastad was dead. The orcs had left before the morning sun had come up. I was left alone, a widow.""*******As recognition filled Pog's eyes, the large full-blooded orc in front of him narrowed his own, regarding the young half-orc carefully. The men in the circle looked at each other in confusion as the orc began to shake, a low grating sound. The orc was laughing.Pog watched as the orc lowered his weapon slightly, extending his arms toward Pog, his head tilted to one side as he said one word, the last word Pog wanted to hear at that moment. ""Son.Pog was not entirely certain what happened next. He was a talented fighter, above average for his age, still not as skilled as a seasoned veteran. But at that moment, he seemed to move like one. With short but efficient strike, Pog's greatsword was suddenly wedged deep into the orc's thick neck, stopping when it hit the spine. It was not a powerful blow, but it had been quick and precise.The large orc---Pog's father---dropped to its knees, gasping for air with a half-severed wind pipe. All the pain, all the rage, of growing up in a community that barely accepted him for the humanity he possessed had come to the surface in a new way. The additional emotions he had been cursed with from his mother boiled up as well, the vivid image of her crying every time she told of this orc's brutality flashing through Pog's mind. His face betrayed it all like a banner in the wind, and the orc drank it in like mead. He resumed laughing, a deep belly laugh, and grabbed Pog's sword, sliding it out of his throat even as it cut deep into his fingers.""What's the matter, human? Do you need a hug?"" The orc gurgled out blood as he spoke. ""Son?"" the orc repeated.Pog stepped up to the large orc, looking him straight in the eye. ""You may have contributed to my existence years ago, but you are not my father,"" he spat.A thick arm wrapped around the orc's head, digging his fingers deep into the bloody wound on the neck. Grasping his own wrists, Pog flexed his arms, then threw his entire weight into turning with his hips.A moment later, something large fell to the ground with a hollow clanking. Pog looked at the gruesome trophy in his hands. The face of his progenitor stared back at him, chuckling again once before the light faded from the eyes.After the battle was over, the village had finally accepted Pogranax as one of their own. Not only had he fought in their defense against orc kind, he had allegedly destroyed the orc that sired him. It may have been the new found respect, but suddenly the village no longer felt like home.His mother had been wounded in the attack. She listened to the tales from the other villagers of the encounter in the square---Pog refused to talk about it---and in some sense, she found relief, but also sorrow. While Pog had now confronted his past and where he had come from, he had opened himself up for a new range of personal conflict. A few days later, after Alais had succumbed to her wounds and been buried next to her husband Habastad, Pogranax had bid an emotionless farewell to the village and set off on his own.He traveled to the largest city in the region and quickly found a merchant caravan willing to hire him as a body guard, which began his journey that took him to the Grand Lodge."9/18/2017 19:51:14,Gallus,Half-Orc,Ranger,"“You have to watch out for the pretty orcs- they don’t lose fights.”Following a particularly brutal, bloody, exciting raid, the orc tribe headed by the conqueror Uzrdakh of the Bloodwastes piled into The Raven and Rose tavern despite initial protests of the owner.  The orcs had common coin enough from their night’s victory and the humans were in no position to refuse a tribe of orcs heady with the rush of sacrament with Gruumsh the one-eyed god.  Half of the tavern was trashed but the gold the orcs left behind was enough to repay the damages- they had little interest in money apart from stealing it from their victims as a sign of power.Mog of the Desolation was the prized female of the tribe and after she had beheaded no fewer than seven Garguns in their latest battle, Uzrdakh was prepared to take her for his mate queen.  After downing an entire keg of dark ale, Mog was only prepared to take to her bed after such a grueling day.  As it stood, in her intoxicated state she became infatuated with the bartender.  Erik of the Tavern, as she knew him.  Their tribe remained outside of the city for about two weeks before their next campaign to move, but it was enough time for Mog and Erik to experience another form of union better than any the orc had ever known with her god.When it was discovered Mog was with child, the tribe was excited until it was revealed that Uzrdakh had not yet had congress with her.  It was a great shame that the child was born half-orc and half-human, but the conqueror of the Bloodwastes was publicly willing to accept the child on the grounds that as soon as Mog was able to bear another child, she would give him an heir.  Atirah was the half-breed’s name.The child was raised among the orcs but was made acutely aware of just how much she differed from her pure-blooded fellows.  Her mother Mog was protective of Atirah, reminded of the kindness and humor of the human Erik who had captured her heart in so short a time.  Uzrdakh took every opportunity to remind the mother and child of his graciousness, and Mog’s duty to withhold her end of the bargain.  When Atirah was 5 years old, she had a brother Kurdusk, the conqueror’s son.Both Atirah and her brother were bastards in their own right, but the tribe seemed to have new life knowing that Uzrdakh had been blessed with a son to succeed him and lead the orcs to a new glory.  Mog cared for both of her children but privately favored her daughter.  The two children grew up in rivalry and while Atirah had the advantage of age, Kurdusk knew that what she could never accomplish was true sacrament with Gruumsh.  He quickly surpassed his half-sister in combat fueled by the carnal bloodlust and frenzy that came from the mark of their maker.  When Atirah was 12 years of age, her brother 7, Uzrdakh went back on his word and publicly denounced the child of two worlds, declaring her a danger to the integrity of the tribe.  Should Mog oppose him, he would execute the both of them in sacrifice to Gruumsh- otherwise, they would both be spared and the child would only be banished.  Atirah left home that night with nothing but a spear and a deep sense of loss- a conflicted loss as she never truly felt at home in the tribe.On her first night alone in the woods, she came across a cave of sleeping bears and after slaughtering the three creatures with enthusiasm, she dragged one bloody carcass back to the edge of the camp, where she was greeted by Kurdusk.  “Brother,” she announced with hesitant pride.  “I killed three bears and I understand now.  I felt Gruumsh’s bloodlust within me.  Please tell your father, I can be a trueborn orc.”But Kurdusk gleefully told Atirah that she could never be trueborn, and if he went to his father tonight it would be to request the privilege of killing his half-sister himself.  “Half-breed, your tribe is worms and your inheritance is death.  You are Atirah for the gallows.”  He produced a whip and proceeded to chase her out into the woods, further than the cave of sleeping, now dead bears, and left her with whip-wounds so severe her back muscles spasmed with pain for a good month.  If you ask now, she will tell you her scars are from numerous tiger fights, or bear-wrestling, and she cannot remember just what claws made what mark.  She would be lying.Atirah matured to adulthood out in the wilderness.  On her 15th birthday she caught and killed a deer, three rabbits, a beaver, and a crow and ate them all in silence.  Even away from the tribe that raised but never loved her, she tended towards chaos and could occasionally hear whispers of Gruumsh, but even he could not have made Uzrdakh or Kurdusk or even Mog realize the earnestness of Atirah’s desire to belong.  The one-eyed god would not share his sacrament with her, because perhaps it was wasted by the wayward human morality she began to feel in her later years.  She learned to hunt to sustain herself, and while her size betrayed her stealth, she learned to pick prey at a range with arrows and other stolen weapons from stray adventuring parties.Eventually, aged 16, she found a city which was a thing she had never seen before.  Mog had described them as tribes of hundreds and thousands who kept their houses rooted in the ground.  Atirah was unsure if every city had one, but her mother had spoken fondly of a wooden stronghold with a bird eating a flower above the door.  It was here Atirah met her father, and it was here she learned what it meant to be human, even if only half.Erik was surprised, to say the least, to know that he had an adult orc daughter as a result of that brief encounter all those years ago.  The Raven and Rose tavern had since been rebuilt of much stronger material, and policy limited traveling parties to groups of ten or fewer.  Erik inherited the building when the previous owner died of pox some six years ago.  While his fellow tavern workers opposed the idea of keeping an orc around in any fraction, be it half or whole or even a toe’s worth, Erik was curious to know if his daughter shared any of the same affectations and affections as Mog, what little he remembered of that two week tryst.  Atirah took a job hauling barrels with which even the human men had difficulty they were too prideful to admit.  She also hunted game occasionally, beasts being her favored foe, and brought the meat to the tavern.  The only payment she wanted was roof over her head and stew enough to live off of.Whenever anyone asked who she was, she would say, “Atirah of the Gallows”.  She was not for death, as her brother had told her, but she came from it.  It was her history and one day her future, but for the time being she was alive and she planned to live.  Atirah did not come from the Desolation or the Bloodwastes, but from the noose-neck of death itself and she walked away from it.  Of course, as time wore on Atirah of the Gallows became Atirah o’th’ Gallows, then Atirah Gall’os, and eventually just Gallus.  Her orc name faded from greeting except for the few who knew her well. At age 21, she was known to all as Gallus, the goodnatured if not overly zealous bouncer at The Raven and Rose tavern who would knock your block off if you dared to start a drunken brawl.  Some believed she was almost too eager to see a fight starting up, so she could jump in and bash heads just a bit before throwing you out.  On rare occasions, she was known to bite off your ear to really slow things down.  Underneath the bar, in pickling liquid, there was a jar of bitten-off ears that Gallus never showed to anyone except those who might join the collection.  She was also a rare shot at darts.The following year, she lost her father and her tavern and her home.  After an afternoon’s hunt, she returned to find the wooden stronghold in flames.  As citizens gathered to watch the liquor-tongued flames leap into the sky, Gallus saw a coin bearing the mark of Gruumsh and his horrible eye left on the cobblestones outside the scorched tavern.  That night, she slept horribly. She awoke weeping.It was tough to find work in that city after the fire, because without Erik the people had no reason to love an orc-born bastard.  Gallus moved to the next city over, taking what little pay she had actually accepted from The Raven and Rose, using it to find temporary accommodations while she practically begged for a job.  She took up work at The Cock and Bull, another tavern, doing the only work she was really good at.  The owner, a Halfling, was pleased to have Gallus’s height and bravado in the tavern.  She hired the orc, who did three times the labor of any human man just to endear herself to the owner. Gallus managed to fall into the routine once more, hauling kegs, hunting game, and drinking ale while she ate dinner from the meat she’d brought in.  It was steady work, and while she wondered what had become of Mog, she didn’t dare to make any indication of her presence to the old tribe.  For the first time in her life she hoped that Gruumsh would forget his wayward half-orc child, trying to stave off his evil as she worked for a better future.  She didn’t walk away from the gallows to turn back into the arms of death, after all."9/18/2017 5:57:03,Threk the Shunned,"Half-Orc, Half-Human",Barbarian,"As the only half-Orc in his tribe, Threk had always had trouble with acceptance in spite of his proven and unrelenting loyalty to the clan.

Legend says one of there forefathers even caught death itself. Now, the family is not that heroic anymore, but very wealthy. Trystan was born as the third son of Mortimer and Eleanor Ravenscar. Mortimer had been a great hunter once, though no one could see that through all his pudginess. He was a very kind man, in contrast with his wife Eleanor, who was cold and ambitious. She insisted that her sons were taught how to hunt in the old fashioned way.Trystan’s childhood was filled with hunting trips together with his brothers, mother and occasionally specialized tutors. At first Trystan loved them. He got to go to some amazing places and see new animals and plants. He asked a lot of questions and soaked in as much information as he could. However, at one point they started pushing him to kill the animals. Trystan couldn’t get it over his heart. In the beginning his mother thought it was just an age thing, but as Trystan got older he still didn’t want to. She tried several methods: using a knife, shooting it from a distance, laying traps. Nothing worked. At one point she was so desperate that she put herself in danger. That did get Trystan to kill it, but it upset him so much that he fled home.For a few years he lived in the wild on his own. He learned how to kill out of necessity. He loved the time on his own and being one with the nature around him.After three years a magical message reached him telling him of his fathers passing. Trystan was devastated and immediately traveled back. The whole house was in sorrow. However, there was not much time for sorrow. Tradition demanded that the three sons had to battle to become the new head of the Ravenscar clan. Not a battle by force, but more like a quest. They would each receive one of the family scimitars and then set out. The first one to bring back a Arthorax would get the position. Trystan had mixed feelings about it. He did not want to kill a living being, but he also wanted to please his mother for old time’s sake.As the youngest, Trystan had to wait for his brothers to go first. When he finally started on his journey he used his knowledge to gather a lot of information about the species. Then he traveled to the region where they lived and studied their behavior for quite some time. After he thought he had a thorough understanding of the being he laid a trap. Against all odds he actually managed to capture one before his brothers did, a young one. However, he still had a long way home, made much longer by the fact that the Arthorax was still alive.. On this way he met his brother, Morrigan. He congratulated Trystan on his feat and said he was the rightful heir. The next morning he was gone and so was the Arthorax. Trystan had been betrayed by his own brother. This was the tipping point for Trystan. He absolutely despised the ways of his family. He did not want to be part of a family that chose prey over their own blood.He followed his brother back to the family manor. Morrigan was welcomed with great festivities. The ceremonial execution of the monster was scheduled the next day. When everyone in the house was asleep, full of the fine wine and food of the dinner, Trystan snuck into the dungeon’s. He freed the Arthorax and ran away from his home with the intention never to return. He brought the animal back to where it came. Since he has been living in the wild on his own, disowned by his family.

The three of them would end up, through the most unlikeliest of chances, entangled in the conflict that would eventually end up sundering the world and causing an age of twilight.  But, hey, they got to preserve their own race because of their heroic actions, so even if they receive no recognition for it they're all good."9/18/2017 10:32:54,Mad Daisy,halfling,barbarian,"Nobody’s sure what Mad Daisy's deal is. Her home is a shack far on the outskirts of territory settled by halflings, and she sustains herself by hunting and scrounging. In fact, she's not crazy, just ferociously independent and ill-disposed toward tight-knit halfling society—or any society. Whatever the circumstances, she'd rather be alone. Every day she spends adventuring with others is a concession, which she tolerates in the hope that it will let her return home with more resources to sustain herself with than before. She's shrewd, no-nonsense and relentlessly pragmatic, and she doesn’t mince words. If there's nothing in it for her, she’s not interested."9/18/2017 9:08:13,Brio Dando,Halfling,Warlock,"Brio Dando was just a young halfling around the age of 22.

In return, he unwittingly received Warlock powers along with his requested meal, and was bound to a mysterious fiend that allowed him to shoot lasers drom his hands. Afterwards, his parents (not understanding of the arcane arts, and thus assumed their son was a Wizard), sent their beloved son on an adventure with a hug, a kiss, and bag full of sandwiches."9/17/2017 19:13:31,Tavis,Halfling,Rogue,"Tavis was a former bandit who, along with his elven sorceress companion, decided to take up a charter to explore and map a piece of wilderness. They needed to lay low until the local authorities stopped looking for them and the charter was a great excuse to get out of town. They hooked up with a dwarf who had more money than sense and was looking for adventure. Rusalka's enthusiasm (and many axes) made up for her general lack of intelligence. Together the trio set out to explore (and loot) everything in their path. Despite the odds they actually survive to found their own very small kingdom. Tavis served as the spymaster.

In his dying moments, he gave Callie his holy symbol and implored her to seek out her mother and father, revealing that he was not in fact related to her, and that had found her under mysterious circumstances. Callie then fled the monastery as troops approached to contain the contagion with fire.

Through the years he survived by keeping the orcs entertained with bad jokes and songs. Eventually growing to be accepted by the orcs, they made him an official member of the tribe.

She was isolated as a child, considering that the monks rarely left the monastery, and she was by far the youngest person there (in addition to being one of the only girls and halflings). As a child, she spent most of her time playing with woodland animals and reading every book in the library. In the twenty years she spent at the monastery, she read through much of the library, even finding a forgotten book that detailed a ritual for devil summoning (although the page with the exact prescriptions had been stolen). However, as she got older, she came to the conclusion that it is important that knowledge be shared and added to by venturing out into the world, rather than staying as a recluse. It was at this point that she decided to leave the monastery, starting her path as an adventurer."9/18/2017 20:01:48,Perrin Thornwall,Halfling,Rogue Sorceror,"Perrin was a difficult child. As the son of the lord of the Lowlands Valley, his pranks, sneaking about, and general disregard for the rules was an unacceptable distraction and political risk. Dragon's blood flowed within his lineage and was known to assert itself every few generations, so Perrin was sent away to a school of magic and politics. Perrin learned a great deal at the school, mostly how to pick locks, move quietly, go unnoticed, and, most importantly, the art of interrogating others without their realizing it.He was almost an adult before he finally was kicked out of the school. The irony that he was expelled for a theft he, in fact, did not commit, was not lost on Perrin. With nowhere else to go, Perrin turned towards home after his expulsion. A day's journey before reaching the boarders to the Lowlands Valley, he overheard news of a coupe. His family had been killed and another family had seized power. Perrin now travels, searching for the means to retake the lands of his family and hoping the power dormant within his bloodline will awaken to aid him in his quest."9/18/2017 9:45:31,Seneon,Halfling,Rogue,"Seneon always had nimble fingers. Those fingers brought shame to his family. His family lived in poverty so he pick pocketed little things, like a coin or two,. He moved to bigger heists, spreading he gains over several days so his family wouldn't get suspicious at a sudden influx. One day, he got caught red handed, on a heist he planned for months. His family, who never thought Seneon could do such a thing, cast him out. He smuggled a few coins out from prison as he was being released, and moved into Rhoona. He bought a building and started a tavern. He ""stole"" from his own tavern at night so people could donate to help the ""poor little halfling"". He gave the money to his family, though secretly, as his family hated him. When the Duke started to make crazy announcements, it affected his business. The dwarves ran to their homelands, fleeing from the Dukes watch. His tavern couldn't pay tax in beer! How was he going to give money to his family! So when the High Priest came looking for people to join a adventuring party, he jumped at the chance. Though secretly, it may not be only about his business and his family, it may be that Seneon has a little spark of adventure in him.

In a state between dream and wakefulness he was greeted by a beautiful green-skinned woman in a scholar's spectacles and agreed to the simple task of pruning thirteen branches for her and her liege-lord, in exchange for avoiding the wrath of his angry employer.  She gave to him a book bound in woven leaves with a golden clasp, then strode fully clothed into the nearby brook and vanished, not realizing that a contract had been sealed.When Jeeha awoke, the book still in his possession, he meandered back to the shire where a huge, monstrous boar, corrupted by some unknown force, smelling of sulfur and dripping with ichor, was trampling crops and had gored a farmer to death.  He felt the powers of the First World flare to life inside him and strike down the boar with eldritch might; as he did so, the first of thirteen verses scrawled itself inside the sewn-leaf cover.  He was hailed as the hero of the village by all, including his employer, who had no memory of having met him, or the work he'd been paid for but hadn't completed.Though he enjoyed the favor of the village for a fortnight, he was soon compelled to leave their adulation and walk the earth by an inexplicable wanderlust, which he could no more resist than the last autumn leaf could hold against the wind, in search of twelve more branches."9/18/2017 18:16:38,Gardenia Bayport,halfling,life cleric,"Gardenia had a normal childhood and upbringing on a busy merchant island populated by fishing and agriculture.

For the time, everything flourished.An untreatable plague, called The Scurge, of divine origins wipes out the halfling town. The event starts by manipulating residents into wanting to stay within town limits, preventing majority of its food sources from leaving, the disease itself transforms victims into grotesque black ooze covered monsters that only seek to feast and turn others, all coherence and personality gone from the being, the incubation time getting shorter with every transfer. Gardenia was a young adult, married with 2 offspring when the town was hit. Her spouse was the first to turn, as they hid in their home, and she sent the children to the cellar so she could eliminate the threat her spouse had become. When she went to check on her children, the eldest was already turning, mutilating and devouring the younger. Gardenia had to immediately kill her eldest child in order to start healing the younger, who did not make it. She snuck off the island while it collapsed on itself, the monsters unable to leave the town and left starving.She spends her time wandering, healing those who need it, and chasing The Scurge to study it and find a cure.

He was very young when a Dragon became agitated and started burning down his village, but was saved, mostly as an after thought, by the Wizard who had come to slay the Dragon (and, in fact, originally stirred it from slumber and made it agitated). The Wizard, Triskell, adopted Bessir as his servant, and took him back to his tower. Triskell was a brilliant Wizard, always pushing forward to bounds of understood magic, but he was sloppy and idle-minded a lot of the time, so many of his experiments would get loose, or cause havoc in his tower. Bessir learned how to use magic from the scraps of knowledge his master threw away, that Bessir was forced to clean up, and learned how to use this magic of Abjuration to calm and banish the horrors that his master unleashed and then abandoned.Bessir bound together his one and only true possession - a diary/grimmoire - out of the scraps his master left behind. When Bessir asked his master - who he saw as a distant but uncaring father, who definitely didn't reciprocate those feelings - who his parents were, and in turn, what his last name was, Triskell gave him a half answer. Triskell told him that he was no one, a nothing, a no body. He told him that all he was good for was keeping the stairs of Triskell's tower. Bessir wrote in his diary, that evening, his own last name: Keepstair.When Triskell was approached by a group of adventurers to aid them in their quest to rid the world of a terrible evil, Triskell was busy elsewhere, and instead sent his servant who he admitted would pass for the lowest of Wizards - but a Wizard none-the-less."9/18/2017 14:29:52,Gwynnifer Glimfinger,Halfling,Bard,"Gwynnifer Shoemaker was born in a small village, the youngest of four, raised by a family of (you guessed it) shoemakers. And while Gwynnifer was undoubtedly an excellent shoemaker (no she wasn't), it never held her interest. Instead, Gwynn would wander the fields and forests surrounding her quaint home, dreaming of epic and fantastical adventures.During one of her escapades, Gwynnifer came across a discarded ocarina in a hollowed out tree. While the instrument was but an amusing pastime for her, it was a treasured item for the trickster archfey, Efnysien, the Lord of Luck and Song, who had misplaced the ocarina.Once while she played the ocarina, Efnysien heard the sound of his misplaced instrument through a fey crossing nearby. He approached her, disguised as an elf and begged her to cease her audial assault, even going so far as to offer her lessons for her compliance. Gwynn should have perhaps been more suspicious of meeting a strange elf in the forest, but instead she was captivated by the strange and unknown.They would meet several times a week for Gwynnifer’s lessons. Although her musical skill was quite appalling, Efnysien saw potential. As a bard himself, there was much he could teach her, and the young halfling was willing to learn if only to hear his tales of mischief and intrigue to fuel her wild imagination. It wasn’t long before the archfey picked up on Gwynnifer’s wanderlust and offered to spirit her away from the quaintness of the village and she simply could not refuse. She left with the fey in the middle of the night, leaving but a loving farewell letter to her family, letting them know that she, unfortunately, was no shoemaker.And so, the duet Gwynnifer Glimfinger and the Magnificent Efnysien came to be. Together they set out, looking for the adventure Gwynn always dreamt of."9/18/2017 9:57:40,Gaia Troff,Halfling,Bard/Ranger,"In a desolate snowy area of the world, there was little to no magic among the people who lived there, and since it was so rare to see magic, it was seen as a dark power, given to evil souls. Gaia was born into a small village of mixed races of Hunter / gatherers. As a child he used to wander off into the woods singing to himself and playing in the snow. One day when he was walking around he was distracted from his singing from a strange melody coming from behind. Upon futher inspection of the strange noise he found a lyre that was gifted to him from a dieity. Not knowing the magic power he held within, Gaia played this instrument with joy. Though he had never played an instrument before he played this lyre like he had been playing it for years. On his way home he heard whispers coming from the lyre. Telling him he should embrace his magical ability. We wondered too close to the camp site without realizing it and was heard by the villagers. Almost out of nowhere they surrounded him snatching the woode, instrument and putting a bag over his head. As he screamed and cried he felt himself being bonded and hoisted. They removed the bag and he was on a steak. Cry for his life his parents could only turn their head at the sight of their only son being a evil magic user. If only they had known the rest of the world's abilities. As they were about to start the fire a green light shit from the lyre underneath him and tore through the ropes. Gaia fell to the ground but was quickly surrounded again, a burst of loud waves rang out from the lyre knocking everyone unconcious, except him.

Occasionally, they even enchant willing audience members and bring them into the performance. Alton, the head of the family, serves as “master of ceremonies,” playing narrator more often than not. His wife Callie is responsible for most of the magic, and their children Cade, Finnan, Jillian, and Cora play rotating roles throughout the night. Cade is a master of disguise, able to slip into any role with ease. Fin and Jill, the twins, are singers, and often perform duets together. Cora takes more of a behind-the-scenes role, assisting with the various illusions the show requires, as well as “other” things.It is a well-known fact that where there are bards, pickpockets follow. The shows bards provide are excellent distractions, and pickpockets love distracted people. It just so happens that the Talespinners have their own resident thief in Cora. Her parents noticed her deft, quick fingers and propensity to shy away from the limelight early, and encouraged her talents as much as they had encouraged those of her older siblings. Alton enlisted the help of his son Cade to teach her the best ways to hide; to slip in and out unnoticed, or if noticed, at least in the guise of another person. Callie taught her the basics of illusion and enchantment, small tricks to distract and confuse her targets that helped just as much with theft as escape. The twins, who had “worked the crowd” until Cora was old enough, taught her how to pick out likely targets; fat purses aren’t always the easiest to find, and they’re not always carried by easy marks.Growing up a Talespinner meant hearing stories of heroes and villians, great beasts and great battles, magic and adventure. While her family was content to tell these stories, reveling in the rapt attention and adoration of their audiences, Cora wanted more. She wanted her own stories, her own adventures. Her family traveled, sure, but she often only saw the roads and towns, the relatively safe places in the world. She wanted to see the mountains, caves, oceans, and dark forests, to fight some of the great beasts from the stories. After a few years of adulthood, she set out on her own, with her family’s blessing, so long as she remembered to bring back new stories for them to tell."9/18/2017 11:18:46,Algher Chan del Corbo,Halfling,Bard,"Search for a Higher PowerWhat was once a trip to learn more recipes, pick up a few songs, and enjoy the decadent and playful life of a wandering musician has changed the halfling from Bixby. Opening his eyes to the world, finding that there are more influences on the world than that of his father Corbo's inn where the key worries were the local farm supplies, watered wine, clipped coins and paying off the Hardesty family for ""protection.""A jaunt into the sewers brought him some cash, an amulet tied to what is now seen as a global conspiracy, and effective control of his first Inn. Control that was later taken away by powers that he had never even considered or acknowledged.  It is those very powers that have haunted his dreams, influenced his music, and altered his carefree outlook. Now, control, power, safety and the effective methods of permanently dealing with threats have crept into his repertoire of skills and general attitude.All of this has brought him to today. Having arrived at his oldest standing inn still under his control, he finds once again threats beyond the pale. Threats that seem to emanate from far beyond the typical corruption of local tax collectors and importers of strange drinks. He faces Gods, their followers, and those who have killed them.He stares at the listing of spells he has observed and purloined, and one keeps on reaching out to him. A spell for making a Hallowed location. The cost of each casting is high, but the protection it offers is far more than ever possible from slipping a few coins to the local constabulary. But how can he embrace this new magic without first needing to bow down to yet another God? And if he must pull power from the Gods, who shall he approach? Pelor seems to allow any to pull power, allowed deep corruption in the church. The Raven Queen is fascinating, but hands off and only seems to tolerate him.So he sits in his room, playing the strange lute he found so long ago. He calls out to the multiverse, seeking not a God to quake before - but rather a God that speaks to him. A God that shares his love of food, music and joy - while also a bit of the trickster. A God who sees the need to heal steadfast allies, but also to quietly and secretively slip the blade through the ribs of a mortal enemy without pause. A God who does not want to Hallow a formal temple, but rather an Inn where the choir sings drinking songs of people of questionable repute, where communion is done from a pitcher, and where enemies fear to tread.Is there a God such as this hearing his music?Or must he become one himself?"9/18/2017 10:16:03,Garim Gamwort,halfling,rogue,"I was raised in Amnwater by my mother, Valyse Gamwort (nee Hatrix). My father, Gorim Gamwort, was a member of the city militia, and was killed when attempting to arrest a murderer. She escaped, having taken three other militia constables out during the arrest attempt.I had a happy childhood, aside from losing my father a young age, with many extended family members around helping to raise me. My father's mother, who I called Gamgee, would feed me butterscotch candies when I helped her in her garden.  My aunt on my father's side, Grayra Gamwort, helped my mother bring me up, and kept my father's memory alive with me through stories.The only family that I have regular contact with is my mum, and my Aunt Grayra. I try to send letters and care packages to them regularly, and will pack up and return to Amnwater, sometimes with little warning. Grayra lives with mum, caring for her in her illness.I've been married twice. The first time, in my youth, was to Bregwen Odiwyn, also from Amnwater. That marriage lasted about 2 years... she didn't like that I was on the road constantly, so she left me. We remain friendly, and she checks in on mum regularly. She's a blessed soul that deserved better. I have a tattoo with her initials on my left shoulder.My second marriage happened ten years later. Idazana Trynlyse was her name. She was a fellow smuggler, and we got along famously. We worked many routes and scams together...  until she decided that the stakes on one job were much better suited to her alone. She stole away in the middle of the night, taking the money and my heart, leaving nothing but a note, sealed with a kiss, saying that she loved me but the gold was too good. I haven't seen her since. The pain of her betrayal has faded over the past twenty years, with only a small resentment remaining.I'm originally from Amnwater. I lived there for my entire childhood, but once I started as a courier / smuggler in my early adulthood, I moved around a lot. I initially returned quickly to Amnwater between jobs, but as the contracts got bigger (and less legitimate), I'd take longer and longer to return.I was an only child, and as older family members passed, the task of providing for the family fell to me. To do this, I began to work as a courier. Initially, I was a legitimate businessman, taking packages and parcels to various places for various people. Soon, though, I found that taking jobs from less mainstream sources lead to more money, which meant I was able to keep my mum more comfortable. She didn't ask questions, but Grayra is suspicious, and questions me regularly, reminding me that my father was a member of the constabulary, without saying outright that I'm dishonouring his memory.Right now, I am just trying to keep my mum comfortable.  I'll send my cut of the profits back to Amnwater via a trusted courier from my own network. She's very sick though, and no doctor or sage knows why. She's old, but if she were healthy, she'd have quite a few years left in her. Otherwise, I'm certain it won't be more than a couple of years until she dies.After that? Perhaps finding the third wife, perhaps gathering enough wealth to start a legitimate courier business.Of late, I found myself in Neverwinter, after hearing of an opportunity for a big score. I figure that if he can make one more big job, I will be able to head home and give mum the rest she truly deserves before she dies.I wear, currently, a heavy leather overcoat that functions as leather armour, sporting a bright purple shirt beneath. I brandish my rapier on his belt, and when traveling, strap my short-bow to his back. I keep a neatly trimmed and sculpted beard, and my wavy, brown hair falls nearly to my shoulders.I've been bestowed the honour of ""Cloak Garim Gamwort"", member of the Lord's Alliance, by Sildar Hallwinter."9/18/2017 9:03:51,Gwynn Bitterleaf,Halfling,Ranger,"Gwynn was a humble young halfling, born to humble halfling parents in a humble halfling village, near a normal sized river and an equally normal sized forest. She doesn't remember much about said humble halfling village as she was separated from her family and friends at a young age. She remembers her parents always told her not to play near the river. She remembers playing by the river anyways. She remembers losing her footing while playing on a bridge over the river. She remembers falling into the river.Young Gwynn was able to cling to a large piece of debris, but unable to direct it to the banks of the river as the current was too swift and she was too small. She rode that chunk of drift wood for hours before, luckily, she was fished out of the river by a group of exceptionally dumb goblins fishing on that river. Unluckily, she wasn't what the goblins were fishing for, she they threw her back into the river. She floated along for hours more before, fortunately, she was fished out again by a group of exceptionally mean kobolds fishing on that river. Unfortunately, those kobolds were dicks, and they took her drift wood and threw her back in the river. These kobolds had no use for the drift wood, they just didn't want Gwynn to have it, so they threw it back as well and Gwynn and her drift wood were reunited a short distance downstream. Gwynn drifted along for hours more, even days, before she was fished out again for a third and final time by a group of exceptionally competitive goliaths. She was able to convince these goliaths that she did, in fact, count as a catch, and that as she was the largest thing pulled from the river that day, her savior was to be named the best fisher-goliath, but only if they didn't throw her back. The river was full of fish, so the goliaths decided not to eat young Gwynn. In fact, the kind-hearted nomads allowed her to travel with them, in hopes that she may one day find her way home. Determined not to be a burden, Gwynn learned to pull her own comparatively small weight. She learned to track from her very tall friends, and thanks to her close proximity to the ground, she proved to have a knack for it. She learned to fire a bow, and thanks to her natural halfling dexterity, she excelled at it. Gwynn learned to survive, thrive even in the wild forests their group traveled through, and she loved every minute of it. As a group of hunters and trackers, the goliaths would often take on bounties for fugitives and monsters troubling the settlements they traveled to, and it was in that endeavor that Gwynn found her true calling. She threw herself into tracking the group's targets and delighted in the battles to subdue their prey. She especially relished in any contract for goblins and kobolds, as she nursed quite a grudge for those that threw her back in the river. Gwynn and her gang of gargantuan goliaths soon became good friends. She listened very carefully to all of their stories and learned a great deal about the world from her nomadic buddies. They even came to see her like a mascot of the group, and she grew to be more like them every day. By the time the nomads found their way to Gwynn's humble halfling village, nothing remained of the quiet young halfling girl that fell into the river many months before. In almost every way except physically, she had become one of the goliaths. Even her own parents didn't recognize her as they entered the settlement. Within hours, she grew bored of the quiet halfling life she had lived before, and within days, she had pissed off most of the village with her now decidedly goliath antics and sensibilities. Only a week after her return, she said goodbye to her humble halfling parents and set out on the path again with her new nomadic goliath family to find adventure.

No one came to claim her as she was being nursed to health over many months. When she was back on her feet, it seemed to her the kindness of the strangers who saved her ran out and an ultimatum was made: she had a home as long as she was willing to be a servant. Faced with what would potentially be indefinite servitude by her 'saviors', she chose to escape during the dead of night.Young and alone in the unfamiliar city of Daftoros, she did her best to survive using her wits, guile, and inherent charm. For a while, she was taken under the wing of a dwarven man named Belven, an older member of the local thieves' guild. He took pity on the girl and helped foster some of her earliest talents at survival. Though he never took her as a charge, he was as close to a companion she had, and he often came in and out of her life at random times. When she was on her own, many gave her food simply because they found the odd little halfling girl to be adorable, not knowing that moments ago she had likely picked the pockets of some rich member of society that passed through. Still, despite honing less than reputable talents in thieving to stay afloat - and it truly was the only way to keep her from dying on the streets from hunger - she did her best to never steal from someone who looked like they needed the coin. It somehow made what she was doing a little more justifiable in her mind, especially as she got older. That those rich folk were easy targets didn't hurt, and she always managed to slip in and out without getting caught. At least, she thought she had been under the radar. In truth, the hardy little halfling had grabbed the attention of the Keep from the very beginning. The fact a child survived the relic's devastation had been a miracle to begin with, and her being saved had all been part of a plan to watch her development to see if she could be of use someday. When she chose to leave who she'd been initially placed with, the decision was made to give her a bit of a wide berth to see where things went.Years passed. The young halfling grew up to become a woman that tried not to be hardened by years of poverty and homelessness. Despite keeping to herself and trying not to get into any more trouble beyond the type that kept food in her belly, she gained a reputation with the criminal element of town as being rather skillful at keeping out of sight and taking things. Because of her own moral code, she never really considered the offers of various thieving groups over the years to join them. She never thought she'd consider an offer, truly.Until she did.When her talent finally garnered her the attention of a well-known thieves' guild, she had initially resisted...until they promised her a payoff that could get her off the streets for good. It was an offer too tempting to be true, but in her desperation for a better life, a life without scrounging to survive, a life she always /wanted/, she agreed to it.In the end, she succeeded. Despite the job being been far more complicated than she ever imagined, she got her hands on the object she had been told to take. It would've been a clean getaway, if not for the fact that the entire thing had been a set-up. Though she had been initially terrified and even tried to escape, she eventually was fully captured.She assumed she was going to be carted off to jail. Instead, a woman named Ane Mone explained to her that she had been personally monitored and chosen for her abilities to do something for the greater good of the kingdom. That she had just past a test she hadn't even known she had been taken and had proven that she was ready to join the Keep.In the end, the offer included exactly what she had wanted to begin with - a place to stay. Coin. Food. That she was going to be tasked with helping keep the same kind of relics that laid waste to her childhood village just felt like a bonus if you asked her. They did not have to say much more for her to agree with the terms laid in front of her."9/18/2017 11:42:56,Ngangkari High-hill,Halfling,Paladin,"Ngangkari (Corrin) is a Halfling Paladin hailing from the faraway town of Maningrida.  He goes by Corrin (the local Halfling name most similar to his nickname, Kari, but more easily pronounceable to people in the region). Maningrida is a rural halfing town in a steppe area near the coast.  Its primary industry is fishing and herding.  Llira, the goddess of Joy, is the primary diety worshipped there. Kari was trained as a painter and storyteller growing up, two roles which often go hand in hand in his town.  He learned the traditional Plains halfling painting style from his mentor, a woman named Tulloun.  It involves painting scenes from the history and religion of the area onto the walls of mud brick homes, with heavy use of of bright pigments and especially shades of red and purple.  He also made his own, nontraditional art which drew on traditional styles but was super weird and conceptual.  A lot of his pieces involved painting features from different landscape scenes on top of each other without regards to perspective.  Naturally nobody would let him do this on their homes, so he had to use canvas. He also learned many stories from Maningrida’s history by heart, along with two other young halflings, Wonambi and Yero, as part of their training as keepers of the oral tradition.  There are always three keepers who pass on their histories independently for the purpose of keeping them as accurate as possible.  Tulloun was the one in charge of Kari, the other two older generation historykeepers were assigned to the others.   Despite the fact that they were not allowed to study together or talk to each other about the stories they were learning, Kari become close friends with Wonambi (nicknamed Ambi) and Yero.  Possibly because of their shared role, they felt a bond that was stronger than that of their other friends, who grew up learning a craft or to herd or fish.  Several years after becoming friends, they ended up in a rather unexpected poly relationship when Kari and Yero, by complete coincidence, both asked Ambi out on a date just two days apart from each other.  She didn’t want to turn either of them down and so the idea of all dating each other was proposed. Aside from Ambi and Yero, Kari’s closest friend was a half-human girl named Josina (her mother was a human traveler who had settled in the region and ran a general store).  He would often follow Josina when she tended her family’s herds, in order to find cool landscapes to paint.  Josina was also a nontraditional artist in her free time, so they got along well. Kari is agender and comfortable with any pronouns; most people initially gender him as male because he was assigned male at birth and presents vaguely masculine most of the time, but some of his closer friends use other pronouns.  The plains Halfling dialect doesn’t use gendered pronouns but there is a general term for transfeminine people, which he was grouped under.  He was never particularly bothered by this classification—it was understood that there was considerable diversity of gender identities covered by it—but he was also more masculine than most such classified people. Traditionally, though this wasn’t a hard and fast social rule, transfeminine people were also considered to be particularly good history-keepers.  Tulloun and Ambi are both transgender women, while Yero is a cis girl and Ambi and Yero’s mentors are cis men.  At age 20, Tulloun was teaching Kari one day when she was suddenly possessed by Llira.  Llira warned Kari that, in 5 years time, an unknown danger would threaten Maningrida from the west.  She told him that, as the town was a place of joy that she very much wanted to protect, she had decided to choose Kari to be a holy warrior and a representative for the town, to go west and train while learning about the coming danger in order to return to protect the town 5 years later. He was not happy about this development at all.  Kari loved his town, and his family, friends and girlfriends and really didn’t want to leave.  Not only that, he thought he was the worst possible person to choose for the task.  He had no experience with either fighting or magic and was super anxious about any sort of battle.  There were plenty of young halflings much stronger and braver than him.  But you can’t exactly argue with your town’s patron goddess.  So reluctantly, he took up his sword and a holy symbol of Llira, and set off.  He also rolled up some of his canvas paintings that he hadn’t given away to friends and relatives, to bring as keepsakes of his home. Leaving Maningrida wasn’t an entirely negative experience, though.  He was excited to see the world outside the coastal plains where he grew up.  Travelling merchants from faraway lands had sparked his curiosity with their stories of life in the cities, in places with different climates and different people. His excitement dampened considerably after a few weeks travelling west.  He didn’t really know if he was even in the right place, and Llira never came back to give him any clarification.  He decided the best course of action was to settle down somewhere, train in his paladin powers and hope the other part of his quest became apparent in its own time.  Now going by Corrin, he joined an adventurer’s guild known as the League of Hardcore Finest, met some interesting people, and got up to some adventurous shenaningans while learning to use the powers Llira had given him.  He started going out with a kind but misunderstood half-orc named Guz after convincing him to stop working with an evil wizard.  He also asked out a Halfling named Schmidt after rescuing them from an airship slowly being consumed by mysterious forces form the far realm (he’s still waiting on their answer though).  He is a bit happier now than when he first arrived in town, but is still feeling rather lost and directionless. "9/18/2017 19:52:15,Micah Starbloom,Halfling,Bard,"The name is Micah Starbloom, contributing writer to the Hathar Gazette. You’ve probably heard of me. Or at least read one my articles. Probably. Unless you’re one of those philistines getting their news from such contemptibly biased publications as This Week’s Good Work or Tower School Times. At least the Gazette sells itself as unsubstantiated rumor. Anyway, the boss suggested that I pull together a bio for that big column coming my way. Berna Fen: A bit harsh kid. The hard-bitten reporter angle might not do it for you. Keep trying. The Enduring Tale of Micah Starbloom (working title)Born to Lyrus and Penelope Starbloom, Micah’s early life was that of farmer’s son. Never as strong or dedicated as his siblings, Micah often struggled to help around the farm. Finding it easier to persuade neighboring children of the joys of hard work, Micah spent his earliest years learning the value of words well spoken. Unfortunately, his mother decided to cultivate this skill with schooling in letters, numbers, and logic, claiming Micah might be bound for a future beyond Farlow village. Naturally, this meant nothing to the boy who was often stuck inside learning, while his brother and sister finished their chores and had the rest of the day to themselves. But after a few years, Micah found himself tending ledgers for many of his neighbors, and even recording official crop yields for Kern’s Harvesters. Of course, Micah’s parents left him some time to enjoy himself. On one childhood expedition, Micah and his brother, Joren, decided to explore a local cave. Down they went, damp and squeezing darkness outside the light of their one lantern. Too many twists and turns ended in a wide cavern. After some searching, Joren found a pile of old bones and was immediately pounced on by a centipede thing the size of a cart. The lantern was smashed, plunging everything into darkness. Micah heard a few moments of struggle, followed by a whimper and silence. Then the clack, clack, clack of far too many legs slowly making their way toward him. Micah tried to run, but was paralyzed with fear. He felt a slimy tentacle work its way across his face, then a paralyzing poison flood into his arms and legs. Micah smelled decay all around him and saw as a corona of tentacles opened around gaping mandibles. Somehow his mind had conjured the face of this monster. And then Micah was thrown from the grasping tentacles. He watched as a silhouette stabbed and slashed at the centipede against a backdrop of silver light. Bursts of lightning flew from the source of the light. After hours, which couldn’t have been more than a few seconds, the creature fell to the ground. Micah heard a familiar voice call to him as darkness flooded his vision again. Awakened to a lullaby he was far too old for, Micah found himself in his bed with Penelope at his side. A frantic moment revealed Joren was also in the room, bandaged and bruised but otherwise fine. After trying to tell his story, Penelope described how she and Lyrus had found the boys, having fallen and hurt themselves in the cave. She discounted the tale of some gallant figure battling a monster as Micah’s imagination running a little wild in the dark. The years that followed were filled with study as Micah scoured the village for some explanation of what he saw. He learned much of the world from the few books he found, and gained a particular fondness for the travelling storytellers who came through Farlow on festival days. Stories were told of great battles between heroes and monsters in the deepest pits of the world and on the highest mountain tops. Someone else may have accepted some mythical hero or a panic induced delusion, but Micah was set on uncovering a greater truth. These years also brought tragedy; Penelope began to fall ill. Despite the ministrations of medicine and magic, a wasting disease set into her bones. Increasingly, Penelope spent her days bed ridden, singing harsh and haunting melodies in a language Micah had never heard. As a final gift, Penelope taught her son his mother tongue, Orcish. In his mother’s final moments, Micah sang the same lullaby he had heard years ago, after the cave. Until that moment Micah had never really questioned his family. He knew his mother was an orc and his father was a human, that his brother and sister looked similar to his parents. He knew orcs were supposed to be vicious monsters, but his mother had never been anything but loving. It had been explained that he was a Halfling and understood he was adopted. Strangers had always seemed uncomfortable around his family, but Micah always thought that was strangers being strange. The people of Farlow had always seemed happy to see Lyrus and Penelope. While his family grieved, Micah scoured the farm for some clue to his parents’ past. And he found it. In a chest hidden in a corner of the attic, Micah found some relics of a past life, including the journal of Lycinius Atrarch, Spell-Shield of the Realm of Kaith. It told the story of a minor noble battling orcs on the Western front, eventually imprisoning a vicious and cunning orc shamaness. During the return from the Roving Lands, Lycinius’ troop was ambushed by a pair of hill giants. As his comrades were slain and one of the giant raised its great club, Lycinius prepared to embrace a warrior’s end. Then lightning tore from the sky, striking the giant dead. Lycinius watched as his prisoner called forth elemental powers in his defense. Together, the pair slew the final giant. The journal continued, detailing a grudging respect and growing attraction between Lycinius and Paren’ha, spirit-speaker of the Crow Clan. The pair travelled to Hathar, skirting both the Kaith Expeditionary Force and outriders of the orc tribes. There they found more allies, foiled a plot to incite a bloody war between humans and orcs, and stopped the sorcerer behind it from summoning one of the Deep Ones. Having gained the king’s favor, this bunch of adventurers went onto many more adventures, even saving a village named Farlow from a child-stealing Creature of the Corn. The journal entries end abruptly as Lycinius and Paren’ha travel to investigate a fallen star in the Verite Mountains with their friends, the Halfling burglar Marrian Farstride, and the Wood Elf ranger Quentarin Red-String. In the chest, Micah found a rawhide packet of Orcish songs and rituals, including his mother’s lullaby, “Little One Come Home.” Between the pages was black-bone flute and as Micah touched it, for a moment he could hear the horns and taste the dust of his mother’s homeland. Night had come by the time Micah took notice of his surroundings. He rushed out find the entire village around Penelope’s funeral pyre. Many kind words were said of her character and her service to Farlow, though none mentioned a shaman who negotiated the release of children from a monster. After all others had left, Lyrus spent one last night by his wife’s side. Micah tried more than once to ask his father about the journal, but Lyrus was no longer the jovial farmer with the easy smile. He stumbled through his routine lifelessly. With his children grown and Penelope dead, Lyrus lost his purpose and he would not entertain the inquiries of his youngest child into stories better left untold. So, Micah left with a set of scrivener’s tools, a flute, and a book of Orcish songs. A note on the hearth stated that he was bound for Hathar and that he would find out the truth of his mother, father, and maybe even his birth parents. And the note thanked his father for protecting Micah on a night many years ago.The journey to Hathar and Micah’s early time there involved some small adventures of minor consequence. Robbed, swindled, and generally unprepared for the wider-world, Micah’s travels made for a difficult lesson. His skill with writing did land him a short-lived position with Barley and Oats law firm. Micah was eventually deemed persuasive but lacking the backbone to pursue a legal career. Other jobs were similarly unsuccessful until Micah found a position as a freelance writer for the Hathar Gazette. Today the Gazette provides a living while Micah works to uncover his family’s past. Despite the paper’s utter lack of reasonable reputation, Micah has found a knack for convincing people to reveal their secrets. And really, who could possibly care that the Dean of Transmutation is having an affair with a research assistant. Or that the King and Queen have been sleeping in separate rooms for the past week. Or that a Justice has been seen dispensing more alms than nooses lately. No one believes this trash anyway. Berna Fen: As much as I know you admire our work here, do remember that I provide that living as you search for some sacred truth of your past. Otherwise I’ll bet this little sob story will get you dedicated readers one day. Keep the stories coming, that piece on the merciful Justice was particularly juicy. "9/18/2017 7:31:04,Neeto Silverspeak,Halfling,Bard,"Neeto Silverspeak is a halfling bard, hailing from the rolling hills of Evermeadow Plot in central Faerun. He was born Nelan Nimblepipe, and raised by his parents on a mid-sized tobacco farm in the countryside. His father was strict, yet loving, and set him to work in the tobacco fields at the age of 8. His mother was a lovely lady, whose every waking hour was spent in the kitchen, preparing food for her ""big strong farm boys"". Neeto had a strong relationship with his mother, but his laziness and aptitude for the eloquent clashed with his father's simple, rustic way of life. Neeto and his father often fought, his father insisting that Neeto stay with the family and eventually inherit the farm, while Neeto shunned the manual labor and preferred to stay indoors studying poetry and orations with the hopes of eventually becoming a noble at a high court. At the age of 14, after a particularly nasty argument, Neeto decided he had had enough. That night, he snuck into his father's bedroom, and stole the entirety of his family's fortune: a measly 27 gold and 42 copper pieces. Telling himself it was an early inheritance, he left his home and set off for greater heights. After weeks of travel and many close calls, Neeto made it to the city of Canyonrun. The capital of the region of Stavin's Desert, it was here that he took on the persona of Neeto Silverspeak. It wasn't long before Neeto discovered how expensive it could be to be rich, and he spent nearly all his money on a secondhand cloak from an upscale street vendor. Not having enough to afford a room at the inn, he slept under a parked wagon. The next day, he confidently strode to the castle to request an audience with the king. ""If I can just meet him"", he thought, ""Surely any noble would be amazed at the most intellectual 14-year-old halfling in the land."" His dreams were shattered by the guards at the entrance to the castle, who laughed at his pitiful, bombastic, and meticulously rehearsed request, and sent him away. Out of money, and now homeless in an unfamiliar land, Neeto had no choice but to turn to thieving to survive. Joining a pack of street urchins, Neeto learned much about the arts of deception, thievery, and, when things turned south, escape. After dozens of strikes, tackles, and pursuits from various shopkeepers and street vendors, Neeto learned quickly how to leverage his small frame to get out of a sticky situation. Often, he ended a chase by climbing the exterior of a building, and leaping from rooftop to rooftop. As a result, he is amazingly nimble when need be, and completely at home at dizzying heights. After a while, Neeto grew bored of the simplicity of the snatch and grab or simple ""distract the mark"" con. He began developing more elaborate scams and incorporated his urchin friends into them. Eventually, he established himself as sort of a de facto leader, a position he enjoyed greatly. Under his guidance, the urchins began making significantly more from unsuspecting targets, and even established a sort of communal hideout in an old house with a caved in ceiling. The next step was to pay off a few of the worse off guards to either look the other way, or even openly join in racketeering scams. This proved to be immensely profitable, and as his wealth increased, Neeto found himself diving further and further into his alter ego, until Nelan Nimblepipe was just a faint glimmer in his memory. The corruption of city guards did not go unnoticed by the authorities however. One day, after a particularly successful day and an appropriately large meal from his favorite inn, Neeto returned to his hideout to find the royal guard waiting for him. Despite his surprise, he managed to escape and fled the city, leaving behind his urchin clan and all of his wealth, save the clothes on his back. He traveled to the Southern reaches of Faerun, to the city of Hammerglass, where he adopted the identity of a used wagon salesman. After a good sanding and a coat of paint, his rotting, decrepyt wagons passed for nearly new, and he found that outgoing merchants were more than happy to trade their worn carriages (plus a little gold) for a shiny, ""like new"" model. After a few days at one location, he would pack up his inventory and move elsewhere, simultaneously avoiding unhappy customers and local merchant's taxes.     	Neeto kept up this racket for years, moving from abandoned plot to abandoned plot, selling wagons and making just enough to live a lavish life - at least, lavish for a halfling farmer. At night, Neeto often slept in one of his wagons, a trade-in that was in good shape. He spent much of his money on books, poems, and even hearing tales told by skillful storytellers. However, for every copper he spent on money, two were spent on food and drink. A potent combination of halfling disposition and a burning curiosity about the life of societies elite lead Neeto to indulge tremendously in food, drink, and other pleasures. His fortune never fully disappeared, but it also never accumulated. Instead, he lived wagon sale to wagon sale, never more than a week or two from being broke, but also just as close to an ill-earned paycheck. As Neeto's rhetoric and command of speech improved, he began to grow dissatisfied with simply manipulating words and people. Instead, he set his sights on magics, and the powers that they could unlock. He studied the works of Eludrian, Corestus, Ragh-tor, Himmel Stayne, and Grosh, all master bards and inspiring leaders with a great many works. He began dabbling in magic, carrying a materials pouch and even pretending to cast spells and ward off spirits for gullible individuals. However, the magic eluded him. Nearly ten years after his escape from Canyonrun, Neeto met a teifling who professed to sell magical components that could unlock hidden magical secrets within yourself. The teifling then demonstrated, having Neeto crush a dried acorn, which, when thrown to the ground, appeared to spawn a beautiful flash of light. Unbeknownst to Neeto, the light was created by the teifling himself, and the dried acorn was picked up off of the road moments beforehand. Blinded by his desperation, Neeto bought the sales pitch, but slyly offered to trade his ""finest"" wagon for the materials. The teifling agreed, and Neeto gleefully made off with the ""magical components."" In no time at all, Neeto discovered that the compnents had mysteriously lost their power, and it was about that time that an angry, sweaty teifling came stomping into his wagon yard, carrying the majority of a splintered wagon wheel, with a large chunk of rotted axle. Wouldn't you know it, said the teifling, but the ""fine"" wagon had just happened to break down a half mile down the road. Neeto countered by raising the question of how it just so happened that the materials only worked when the magical was around. The two parties, each afraid of being exposed, but even more indignant at being conned by the other, began a heated argument. Before it could come to blows, the two were interrupted by a group of armed men. As it so happened, one of Neeto's unhappy customers had finally managed to track him down, and had arrived with some mercenaries to exact his revenge. The teifling surprised Neeto by informing the man, in no uncertain terms, to kindly go pound sand. A fight ensued, and Neeto watched in terror as the sorcerer engulfed his would-be murderers in a spout of flame. After a minute of silence, Neeto cautiously proposed an alliance, whereby the two teamed up to double their con. Neeto, the friendlier face, would act as the face of the duo, while the exotic teifling could flex his magical muscles as an enforcer and intimidator. To his surprise, the teifling accepted, and the prolific duo of Neeto and Griffin were born. After liquidating his wagon stock, Neeto and Griffin traveled north to Waterdeep, where they ran various scams and racketeering. Neeto found himself intimidated by Griffin's presence and propensity for violence, but was grateful for the companionship and protection. After months of travel, Neeto finally worked up the courage to admit to Griffin that he had always envied the magic that he wielded, and that he would like to know if Griffin could teach him how to use his own magical potential. Griffin laughed at Neeto, touting his magical heritage and assuring the halfling that true magic came from ancestry. However, Neeto insisted, and offered to give up most of his earnings for Griffin to teach him. Griffin agreed, if only to prove that he was right. For many weeks, Griffin and Neeto trained near nightly to cast the most basic spells. However, one night, after a long night of failures, and not-so-passive aggression from Griffin, Neeto had enough. Frustrated, he yelled a string of insults at his teifling companion, channeling his rage and mixing it with flowery speech borrowing from his many stories. Much to his surprise, the sorcerer stumbled backwards and clutched his head, looking dazed. Neeto stood uneasy, as a look of shock, and then a slow smile spread across his friend's face. ""You did it"" he said, looking up and chuckling. ""You actually did it"". 	After a few more days of practice, Neeto learned to channel his words into magic, stunning opponents, empowering allies, and even winning over skeptics. He learned to weave words that could bring an audience's imagination to life, deceiving their eyes and presenting a convincing illusion. He crafted masterful jokes that would seize the mind of it's target, trapping them in uncontrollable laughter. His words could embolden anyone, make them more charismatic, or stronger, or even a little bit smarter. He reached new heights as a con man, and practiced his magic whenever he could. This led to many failures and a lot of narrow escapes, much to Griffin's annoyance, but the duo managed to do well, and eventually found themselves living relatively lavishly for a pair of vagabond criminals. They traveled to the city of Priencia, where they set up a con as the fictional Duke of Everhollow. The duo managed to scam a not insignificant amount of money from the citizens of the city, but a few more missteps necessitated a hasty exit. Neeto and Griffin decided to set sail to the city of Certosa, to the north, contracting out a small shipping boat with a handful of other guests. It was on this voyage that Griffin and Neeto discovered a powerful cube, and, on promise of money by a mysterious scholar, set out on a journey to unlock the secrets of its shrines. "9/18/2017 11:47:19,Cayenne Killsure,Halfling,Rogue,"Life is an adventure and I don’t want to miss it.  I’ve learned a few things about staying alive and taking others before they get me.  My family thinks I’m crazy and I’m sure they’ve long sense washed their hands of me.  I’m not worried as when I left there were 10 others and ma was due any day.  They all liked the farm and didn’t mind doing the same thing day after day.  I couldn’t stand it.  I always knew there was adventure and treasure and all kinds of things out there that I just couldn’t get out of that stupid little dirt farm.  I stuck it out as long as I could but my nature was always getting me in trouble.  One day I’d heard ”You’ll live by my rules and earn your keep as long as you’re under my roof” once to often.  I walked out right in the middle of the lecture and only stopped long enough to grab the stuff I’d been stashing against such a day.  That was my 13th birthday and I haven’t been back sense.  As far as I know they are still there doing the same things as they were doing when I left except I’m sure there are alot more of them by now.  I hooked up for a while with a group of bandits but soon realized I’d be better off elsewhere.   It wasn’t just that they weren’t very skilled, they were just down right stupid.   I stole their stuff right from under the leader’s nose while he was asleep and spent 2 days putting as much distance as I could between us.  2 weeks later they were completely wiped out by some group of mercs that were hired by the locals to end their petty tyrany.  I hooked up with a traveling band of entertainers next.  They were a fun bunch of people.  By the time we hit the 3rd town I had proof of what I’d started to suspect on the 1st.  There were certain members of the team with extremely useful tricks that they practiced to benefit the whole troop.  I mean this troop cleared a very hefty profit that had nothing to do with entertainment rewards.  When I confronted one of them and gave him a choice, I could turn them in or he could teach me all he knew.  This highly amused him and he decided to take me up on the offer.  I spent the next  6 years learning my trade.  Not only the fine art of  lifting the things that I knew would be put to better use by me.  They also taught me the fine art of eliminating peoples’ problems in a permanent way for an appropriate, some might say exorbiant, price.  However you get what you pay for.  Permanent solutions aren’t cheap.  I was a wild card that no one would look at twice.  I always had a cover, after all who would suspect a seemingly child jester of being in reality a master assasin?   My professional handle is Death Rattle and I became well known in certain circles as being very efficient.  I finally decided to strike out on my own as the whole entertainment thing was wearing thin.  We parted on good terms and it was agreed that we would keep in touch professionally.  I  would continue to take jobs and make contacts thru their network and they would take 10% of all jobs that went thru them ( while I traveled with the troop I only made 60% as the other 40% went to the troops profit/operating expence fund).  However I would travel across the country on my own to find new adventures as well.  By this time I could take the jobs that interested me and ignore the rest.  I was welcome to return any time I got tired of adventuring on my own.   Once again I set out to find adventure, only this time I was much better supplied.  I had a 1,000 ilb bag of holding and enough trail rations for 2 mos.   As well as a decent weapon and armor, enough platinum, gold and gems to last for awhile.  The rest of my earnings were invested in the troop’s investments.  I’m determined not to touch those though.  The longer they stay there the more they earn.    - I found a big castle to wander in.  There were some promising hits, but I ended up teleported to Shadowdale.  I hooked up w/ another halfling (or rather he hooked up w/ me).  He took me to a magick store where I priced things out.  The useful stuff was 1,000 GP and up.  Cisreal was interesting and told some wild tales.  Well we wondered  around town and I spent the night at a good Inn and I plan on working tomorrow.-Every one was talking about some commotion about a male/female, there are several differing stories about that.  Anyway it was a new student that had a duel of somesort at the magic college.  He/She ended up as a Female.  Working around I freed several GP from a fat merchant.  Then as I made my way thru town and a came across a fat purse just sitting on the ground behind a thug.  I just couldn't pass up the oppurtunity and I got the purse w/o any problems.  As I went by I noticed that the interesting group that I followed here was having some sort of confrontation.  I decided to double back and check things out.  That's when I noticed the thug was wearing several magical items.  I decided to relieve him of at least one of them.  However he didn't appear amused, even when I flashed him a grin.  He drew his sword and I decided to tumble threw the frey.  I took refuge under a table that a kid was sitting at.  The fighters took out  the thugs and I managed to stay unharmed by it.-I decided the area was one worth sticking around in for a while.  There were alot of possibilities around here for sure.  There isn't even much of a theives guild in this city.  Now that's a crying shame.  I guess I'll just have to take advantage of it.  -I was contacted thru my old friends for a fairly easy job.  It only took 2 wks to set up and it was done in a permanent sorta way.  I got my gold and sent them their's.  I spent most of the last 2 months wandering around and doing some light work.  I am after all far more curious about new surroundings than anything else.  All in all I've made just under 1,000 gp for the past 2 months.  That includes my old friends' cut.   I watched the group I came here with as well.  They are not to bad.  One of them pretends he's royalty and eats anything that is not tied down.  The kid is the brain of that particular bunch.  The paladin is far more interested in learning fighting than anything else.  Typical for that breed.  The one magic user is still female although she looks like she switched heads or something.  The other magic user has some comfort, useful magic in a day to day way.  He just doesn't have real powerful combat stuff from what I've seen.   Although he excels at annoying the fuck out of everyone else.  The other halfling fits in as well.  Usually he bears the brunt of the jokes from the one magic user, and tries to protect the kid from the Royal Pretender.  All in all the dynamics are amusing to watch.  I have no idea why they stick together but they do.  -I was approached and told to go to the inn for another briefing.  They said it would definately be profitable though.  This contact came straight to me and not thru my old friends.  I guess I'm getting a reputation on my own now.  Interesting what some profitable working can do.  I went, and was told the price is 2,000 gp up front and 8,000 gp ea when we are done.  It sounds like it would be fun anyway as it involves planeshifting.  Something I've only done when I got here.  Did I mention the weird group is hired as well?  We are all going to Kalamar, to a city called Thycasha.  There is a sage there we have to go see.  Apparently, some archeologist known as Mad Raddock borrowed 100,000 gp and started giving it away to everyone but the owners.  He was trying to find the ""Orb of Midnight"".  According to the sage, there are actually 2 pieces that make up the Orb.  The local Temple of Nightmares or something like that is after it as well.  Their symbol is a full moon w/an open eye in it.  I will definately keep my eyes open for the symbol and stay away from the anyone who has anything to do with it.  If we are indeed after the same thing  they are probably more than willing to slit the throat  of anyone who gets in there way.  Holy Fanactics, there is no one crazier in all the planes.  The sage said he could draw us a map and we agreed to wait the 2 days and pay the 500 gp for a very fine, very detailed map.  I will try to get ahold of it before all things are said and done.  Unfortuneately the other halfling is the groups map carrier.  That  will work as long as I get it when we are done.  While we were waiting on the map, we decided to check out the town and see what was to be had.  I found a Ring of Protection +1, that I decided to splurge on.  The Royal Pretender placed a 800 gp price on the head of one the mage's familiar.  It was tempting but I know better than to fuck w/ a mage's familiar.  Someone else didn't know better and killed it with several ice blasts.  I looked around but nothing else caught my fancy.  A really stupid thief tried to make off w/ my belt pouch but he was very unlucky.  I grabbed his wrist and asked him ""Don't you know better then to try that on someone else in the trade?"" He just kinda panicked and said ""Let me go!""  I told him I would as soon as he removed his hand from my pouch.  He dropped my pouch like a hot potatoe and took off like the hounds of hell were after him.  If he is an example of the local talent, I'm not to impressed.  Although from the looks of things with the amount of guards all over you gotta give him credit for trying.  Any way the next 2 days were fairly uneventful.  The mage is mad and the Royal Pretender is carrying around the iceball remains of familiar it cost him 800 gp to have killed.  The other halfling was forced to find stabling for his mount as there is no way the beast can take the heat of the desert.  To bad, it seemed like a nice St. Bernard.  I believe that everyone in the group but me is dead broke now.  Some items that looked interesting but I couldn't afford were, Flask of Endless H20 (5,000 gp) ring of protection against the elements +5 (1,500 gp).  Maybe when we get back I'll pick them up.  I'm trying to decide what else would be useful besides a bag of holding 5,000 ilbs.  I think I may try to find one of those stone mounts that go back and forth from stone to flesh.  Maybe a bear or a cat of some kind.  I know that my dreams are becoming very interesting.  They are featuring me casually flinging magic about like a sorceror, sometimes I even have a ethereal type monkey on my shoulder.  Other times I'm actually holding a conversation with the monkey.  I'm not sure why I've been dreaming these but they seem unusual to say the least.  I'll have to talk to the spellcasters and see if I can figure out where they are coming from. They may just be part of this place, but they seem almost familiar, as if I've dreamed them before and just not remembered the dreams when I woke up.  We finally got the map from the sage and set out immediately.  At the end of the first day we voted to travel at night instead of daylight though.  This is my first experience with the desert.  I would much rather sleep thru the heat of the day whenever possible.  We came across a strange person, almost naked who apparently lived off the blood of vultures.  Better vultures than halflings, but he was still pretty weird.  I kept my distance, and was releived to leave him behind as we continued our trip.  At the rate we are traveling it will take a total of 7 days to reach our destination.  At least we don't have to cross the hills as well.  We've been staying the night in some sort of magical fort that protects from the elements put up by the mage that lost his familiar.  He seems a fairly good sport about it so far though.  I don't think I would be in his shoes but to each his own.  We came across some people looking for lost mines and found out that there are actually quite a few people populating the desert.  Several groups/singles have passed by with the moon/eye symbol as well.  I am definately still keeping and eye out for them.  We have only had 3 instances where we were troubled by creatures out to do us harm.  In all 3 cases the monsters were stopped w/o my direct help.  I must admit I'm pleased with the groups determination to totally annihalate anything in their way.  The one arrow that I managed to get off completely missed the Manticore.  The rest were dead by the time I loaded my cross-bow.  That makes me feel better for their survival when we get to the pyramid we are looking for.  We came across the Pyramid at the end of the 7th night.  We did a basic look around but decided to enter tomorrow when the whole group was fresh.  I can't wait until then as then we will be in my element.  I'm getting a good night's sleep as tomorrow the real fun begins.  I hope we find a bunch of gems and stuff.  Wouldn't it be cool if we found some enspelled gems as well.  They would be worth a bundle to the right market.  Most of the time people don't even think of it though.  "9/18/2017 12:04:14,Tia ,Halfling ,Rogue ,Tia was the daughter of a merchant. One night she wandered away when they were traveling.

Eventually, he turned to religion - Pelor, specifically - in the hopes that the god of sunlight might either cure him of his affliction or burn him in holy fire. The god granted neither wish, but instead appeared to Nehl in a vision, telling him to travel to a certain place and meet with a certain party of adventurers.

She would often mimic the exercises performed by both the dragons and her elders, mastering them after no more than a casual glance. Houjin recognised hers as a mind with the  potential for nearly limitless growth, so she was taken on as a student. Oona quickly mastered not only the exercises but the draconic language itself. But as Oona grew, she began to feel restless. She had a longing, although she was unable to identify what for and she started to question whether or not Houjin truly knew all the answers to the questions of life. When Oona achieved the status of Master, she cared more for the autonomy of the position than the honour. With her newly gained access, he spent many a day alone, exploring the deepest and dustiest cavities in the sanctuaries, slowly piecing together clues that illuminated the forbidden past. Her peer yet competitor, Yashin, warned her of the danger in seeking out knowledge without the dragonlord's permission, but Oona saw no harm in research; besides, something has never felt right in the histories. She discovered the truth of Faerun's past; it was not always a world ruled and feared by dragons as the teachings of Houjin claimed. At one time, humanoid 'Khans' led mighty clans that dominated the land unopposed. Oona also learned legend of a powerful spirit dragon, Tatsuo, from whom all dragons were formed. She felt drawn to find Tatsuo, believing he could quench her longing for clarity. Eventually she was discovered, confronted and ousted by Yashin, who had hoped to use her downfall to further his own stature. Oona managed to overpower and disfigure him then made her escape but was labeled as a heretic to be killed on sight.

He was the middle child of 6 children, three older brothers, one younger brother, and one younger sister. His three brothers, adept magic wielders themselves, were already employed as guardsmen. Araniel focused most on learning magic, but was also trained to become a soldier. He?s the same age as the prince, and because his parents are so high class he actually grew up being friends with the prince, who gave Araniel a lot of really expensive gifts, jewelry in particular. This sparked Araniel?s interest in precious stones, especially when his siblings started getting jealous of his friendship with the prince. It made him feel unique in his very large family. His parents were humble despite their high status and they disliked all the gifts, forcing Araniel to return them, but he kept a ring that remains a special token of his friendship with the prince. Years later, their land was brutally attacked and Araniel fought for the first time. In doing so, he watched his boyfriend and one of his older brothers die, and another get his arm cut off, which traumatized Araniel and made him realize he couldn?t be a soldier for the rest of his life. In confiding with his friend, the prince suggested Araniel become a royal precious stonesmith, Which Araniel was very enthusiastic about, and the prince introduced him to a local jeweler. There, Araniel began to neglect both his guardsman duties and magic studies to learn the art of jewelry making, which his parents eventually had to come to terms with when they realized how happy he was. He?s still technically just an apprentice stonesmith and technically still officially employed as a guardsman, but he periodically takes long expeditions to discover new precious stones/metals. Because he?s dabbled in so many skills, magic, fighting, and artisan, he?s trying to prove he can become truly proficient in one thing for the rest of his life, and he wants that one thing to be jewelry making. "9/17/2017 20:33:28,Morwen Liadon,High Elf (moon elf),Rogue ,"Morwen was raised in the isolated Moon Elf city of Evereska. Her parents Carric and Enna, while present, were distant, more prone to wandering the streets of the city and engaging with the community, than spending time with their daughter. By the age of thirty she already felt the wanderlust that plagues her race and her parents apprenticed her to a venerable Bard, local, and a friend of the family, so as to learn his trade. Morwen showed little aptitude for music, though excelled at story telling, making even the most outrageous tales ring with truth. After ten years of learning, her Master unexpectedly died, (old age takes its toll even on Elves, eventually) leaving Morwen without a mentor, and with an incomplete bardic skill set.She returned to her parents’ home, heartbroken, lost, and still longing for the freedom that the walls of Evereska could never give her. Rather than find Morwen another mentor, Enna convinced Carric to allow Morwen to choose her own form of study, whether that meant continuing the Bard’s path, or another. Morwen was unsure, and after a few more years of general study she discovered a lesser deity that she had never been taught of before: Fenmarel Mestarine, the lesser deity of outcasts. In her research she found a connection to the deity, and discovered her own ways to give praise, seeking out lonely corners of the city, abandoned buildings and underground gambling circles that those yet to reach adulthood weren’t meant to see. She found a skill at hiding, at sneaking and sliding through shadows, unseen by many around her. It was only when she was caught that she found her true calling. Faleas Stagswift was his name, and he was also in the shadows. It was in the process of a planned assassination that Morwen got in his way, and rather than kill her for the inconvenience, he was convinced to teach her his ways. It wasn’t easy, and Morwen never was more grateful for the old Bard’s teaching than when she told Faleas her life’s story. The story was full of lies, of course, and by the time Morwen finished talking she had Faleas convinced that she was an orphan, escaped from a dangerous caretaker, and not only in dire need of his assistance, but also an apt learner for his skills. Morwen did not return to her family’s home except once, to retrieve what little belongings she felt were truly hers. Her parents were not home. She didn’t really wonder if they would miss her, and she felt, truly, that they wouldn’t really notice she had gone. Faleas didn’t so much raise her, as he did tolerate her presence and allow her to observe. She found a home in the taverns they circulated between, loving the smells of cooking meats and drunken gambling around her. She was nearly seventy by the time they first ventured from Evereska into the Vine Vale and the Greycloak Hills below, trading odds and ends and scraps of information for anything they could get. There weren’t many people in the surrounding hills, and they often ventured back into Evereska when supplies ran low, or opportunities for wealth waned. Throughout this time Morwen learned that, more than danger, Faleas traded in information, and that information could be the most dangerous tool of all. She vowed to never tell a truth about herself if she could help it, because if an enemy didn’t know you, they couldn’t beat you. Morwen learned more than a little skill with bow and blade through hunting in the hills, but Faleas never asked for her assistance in the messier of his contracts, nor did he allow her to follow him. It was on those nights alone that Morwen would consider her life, her choices, and what those would mean for her once she was old enough to leave.When she was nearing her ninetieth year she began running cons of her own, independent of Faleas and his contracts. She never lost the skills the old Bard taught her, and she found it was much easier to convince someone that she was worthy of trust, than to prove that worthiness with her actions. Disguises became her fare, and it was not uncommon for her to see how many times she could meet a single tavern patron in one night before they caught wind of the ruse. It was also around this time when they first starting hearing tales of a wanted man and his young apprentice, sought in connection with a dozen murders and two dozen burglaries, with descriptions eerily similar to that of Faleas and herself. Descriptions of her were always vague and quite often glaringly inaccurate, but it was the first time Morwen felt more fear than exhilaration when someone looked at them twice in a shady tavern. Faleas, much older and blindingly secure in his skills, didn’t fear their bounty and continued his work with a tiresome pace. Morwen did not know if he was losing his touch, or perhaps it was simply a string of bad luck, but shortly before her hundredth year, Faleas was arrested and immediately sentenced to prison. She never found out how long his sentence was determined to be, but from every bit of gossip she could gather, they never found Faleas’ mystery apprentice, and the man denied her very presence. On her own for the first time in her life, and nearing what most elves would consider “adulthood”, Morwen began to travel more extensively. Her cons didn’t work at every tavern, but she found it was easy to play a new role in every town, even without the hassle of disguising her face. She found entertainment and company in many a pub from Evereska’s surrounding hills, to the high moors, to the very outskirts of Waterdeep. One of the easiest cons, she learned, was what words to say to convince an attractive stranger to share your bed. She enjoyed the company of every person she conned this way, and though none knew her true name, she had to admit, she fell a little bit in love with each and every one. She felt as if there were infinite parts of her heart, already shattered from too much distance, that she left with each of her lovers, a memory of her presence being perhaps the only true thing about their time together. It didn’t bother her, but the idea that perhaps someone would demand more of her, pieces of her heart that she wasn’t willing to give, and that she would be unable to stop it, worried at the back of her mind. She continued this con, and many others, traveling far and wide across the Faerun countryside. She rarely used the same name twice, and never the name she was raised with. Each evening she offered prayers to Fenmarel Mestarine, and embraced the life of an outcast that she had chosen to live, and each morning she moved on, town to town, city to city. She did not live uncomfortably, and her skill with both secrecy and deception gave her a certain leg up in games of cards that relied on more than chance, allowing her to earn an income with very little of what a common man would consider “work”.  There were many romances that lasted more than a night, many lovers staying at her side for months or even years at a time. She loved them all, though did not mourn their choice to leave, respecting their freedom to travel and love as they wish, just as she would like to be respected. She encountered, laughed and fought and drank, with those of every race, including a fateful encounter with a drow, who strayed near the surface one night when Morwen was alone. The drow female was alone, looking paranoid and scared of the very moon in the sky, but not so evil as she had been raised to believe. They didn’t share a language, but in their brief exchange they found the word for Fenmarel Mestarine, the lone wolf, was the same, and they found a brief kinship in their worship. The drow, most likely having had her fill of the surface, retreated into the cave from whence she came, but Morwen left changed by the experience, and half wishing she had a reason to adventure into the underdark to see what she could learn. It is this life of adventure-- scam, travel, and entertainment, that Morwen has chosen for herself, and though she sometimes longs for more, a deeper purpose beyond her current learning, she’s content in her place.

Like her father Grier and her older brother Harris, it was expected that she would work the sawmill when she was old enough. But the traces of magic that ran in her family surfaced at a young age. Grier, who thought magic was the stuff of ""nobles and time-wasters who don't do honest work"", was opposed to her receiving training, but her mother Iona wrote in secret to the House of Mysteries, one of the most renown schools of Arcana in the world.Though unhappy, Grier eventually agreed that Màiri's gifts needed honing. Her magic was uncontrolled by her own poor understanding of exactly what she was capable of. Untrained, she might even have been dangerous to have around. So she left Kelness and her family and started her residence in the House of Mysteries. The training was hard, particularly because some of the Senior Arcanists barely bothered to teach her, forcing her to learn a great deal on her own just to keep up. These teachers felt that a Dwarf from a poor family would never truly be capable of measuring up to other mages. Màiri intended to prove them wrong. She worked tirelessly, often falling asleep in the libraries and needing to be carried back to her bed.During one of these late library sessions in her second year, she met another student who was struggling. Zaia Aster was an Elf from a prominent magical family who was also struggling with the expectations of her teachers. In her case, they were impossibly high due to her family's fame. She and Màiri agreed to help each other, and after a great many long nights studying and practicing together, both realized that they had fallen in love.Sadly, fate intervened in their happiness two years later. Both had progressed in their studies to more than satisfactory levels, and were about to graduate to Junior Arcanists and be given field assignments. Days before the ceremony, a letter arrived from Zaia's parents. They had arranged a marriage for her, to a man from a house of great standing. All of Zaia's protests fell on deaf ears. The wedding would go ahead as planned. So Màiri was forced to part with her, but not before Zaia gave her an Elven sword and a promise that she would always love her. The graduation was a more somber affair than Màiri had expected, but the promise of getting to go out into the world as an official representative of the House of Mysteries lifted her spirits a little. She vowed that she would work harder than ever, that she would do her teachers, her family, and everyone else proud. And that one day, maybe, she and Zaia would meet again."9/18/2017 13:08:30,Anakis Tycretaur,Hobgoblin,Sorcerer ,9/17/2017 21:35:41,Crog,Homebrew Elf,Fighter,"Crog was a typical pirate, enjoying his life manning the crow's nest, until the local navy caught up to their ship.

The wizard killed her companions and placed Kayla under a domination spell, forcing her to take part in a ritual, too abhorrent and evil to print here, that bonded Kayla with a terrible demon, birthed from her own body, a demon that killed her master and freed her from her slavery to an evil wizard and instead placing her in command of a power beyond that of most mortals. The demon has not forgotten her, however, and watches her movements with great interest, it’s goal unknown."9/18/2017 15:49:18,Moriarty,Human,Ranger,"Born as a bastard from one of the Druidic Sect of the Gatekeepers, a sect based off keeping the world from the unnatural and protecting the world from dimensional threats, Jack Moriarty was placed into a ranger school, at the mercy of his father, and trained there his whole life. He was a promising student, and learned the craft of monster hunting quickly, but the sect was disgusted by his unnatural upcoming.  Later down the line the daelkyr started to invade the plane, and during this war his ranger school sent on suicide mission to close a portal used for the invasion of daelkyr. Most of his school died, including the master druid of the school, Moriarty’s father.With his father out of the picture and no one to say otherwise, Moriarty was discharged from service, as he was the last in line to train new rangers of his school, but deemed to unnatural to be a leader. Moriarty then left his lands to find purpose. With his combat prowess and knowledge of the monstrosities that plague the land, he became a bounty hunter to make a living, and ultimately as a to stave off the civilization from the unnatural and extraplanar. He holds the values and core beliefs of his sect to heart even after being cast aside."9/18/2017 5:10:15,Keold Morgwend,human,cleric,"I am the second son of the Morgwend noble family, the family set up as the next ruler in the cyclical monarchy that exists in the frigid kingdom of Arena. My eldest brother`s untimely death and the uncertainty of the legitimacy of his heirs made my father gather me and my brothers and proclaim that if one of us gets to rule their own land or obtains great power, without defining what ""great power"" would be, he would become the new heir, instead of the children of the one who planned our brother`s widow and her family, which we suspect of having planned his death. I value power, as I need it. I value carnal pleasures more than I should. I value a peaceful community and my authority as a noble. Friends are things I have very few of. To earn my trust is to earn the right to have me shed my blood for you. I trust no women. To me, they`re like a wine merchant while I`m a poor alcoholic, so I never trust any person who has this kind of power over me. To fulfill the wishes of my father, I decided to travel the world, searching for  magical items that produce heat or alter the climate of a large area, to aid in the expansion of our kingdom."9/18/2017 10:12:03,Dren Burrows,Human,Monk,"Dren grew up in the farming town of Orthantis with his twin sister Nala and his mother Ada. By the time the two of them were born, their father was no longer in the picture, but was never explained to them by their mother the exact reason of his absence, be it either gone or dead. His mother was one to stay sick quite often, so it fell to him and Nala to be able to provide for them.Their official job had always been street performers, usually a form of acrobatics or dance, though Nala had always been the better of the two in that aspect. To supplement this, Dren took to petty theft and always had an excuse for his actions, though never stealing from someone who could not afford to lose it. Eventually he stole from the wrong noble and was caught, faced with imprisonment. Though from the good nature of a traveling monk, Akta, he was given the choice of training and reform under the monk's teachings.Isolated with Akta in the mountains for almost eight years now, he has learned to be self sufficient and has trained much under his teacher in learning peace and the ways of the monk tradition. Akta had set out on a journey some few months prior and while Dren trusted their safety, has started to become concerned."9/18/2017 12:11:52,Cassius Drestin,Human,Fighter,"Cassius was born in the small village of Valmir off the coast of the Blood Sea. Being small, he was often bullied by the other kids in the village. This led to him becoming very troubled and the more they beat him, the more he began to enjoy it. He began to revel in his pain and the pain of others. Cassius hit puberty and went from a small 5 feet, 100 lbs. to a towering 6'9, 200 lbs. of raw muscle. He left the village and went to join the King's army. After 20 years of being a soldier he was kicked out for being too brutal and it was found that he had been collecting the hands of those he killed in battle. Angry at being kicked out Cassius becomes a drunk and often found himself involved bar fights. Cassius found himself on the wrong side of the law after one bar fight where he resumed his habit of collecting hands. Fleeing from city to city, Cassius's necklace and belt and hands waved menacingly from his neck and waist. Forever growing and becoming a warning to everyone. Wandering the wild, on the run from the law and looking for purpose, Cassius joins a group of adventures on a quest to save the world. It was time for this psychopath to do some good and redeem himself."9/17/2017 19:14:07,Mirellia Wolfsbane,Human,Ranger,"Mirellia was raised in a rural backwater village on the edge of a forest. The daughter of a blacksmith, she loved nothing more than ""testing"" the weapons he made for adventurers who came to town. She felt torn between her family and her desire to see the world... until she was fifteen. On a gloomy autumn morning, Mirellia was stalking a deer to kill for venison when she heard the howling of wolves--coming not from the deep woods, but from the village. At the sight of smoke rising over the bare branches, Mirellia sprinted back towards her village... to find her family, and most of the other villagers, dead. Their flesh was carved with deep fang-marks and wolf-tracks surrounded the huts, some of which had been set alight.Mirellia fled to a nearby Elven village, which kindly took her in. There she learned the forest-craft of the rangers, all while cultivating a deep hatred of the beasts that murdered her family. She learned enough to know that those could not have been ordinary wolves; but the elves could tell her little of what they actually were. Still, when it was time to set out on her own and, if she could, avenge her loved ones, Mirellia took on a name that she thought fitting, and became Mirellia Wolfsbane. To this day she is the huntress of all lupine things--werewolves, worgs, and winter wolves alike are her prey."9/17/2017 18:55:13,Tejain Armacre,Human,Wizard,"Tejain Armacre is the youngest son of a conservative, wealthy, hawkish family. They were instrumental in starting the war, profited from it, and have absolutely no sense of shame or noblesse oblige - only anger at how they were treated. (They ran out of allies, and their extensive estates became battlefields and, later, chips on the bargaining table, leaving them refugees.)Tejain had three older brothers. The two elder died nobly (or pointlessly) in battle, and the youngest carries on the fight even now. They are the pride of the family. Tejain's service was minimal, secret, and totally unappreciated - he saw one engagement at Miton's Wells, an utterly pointless massacre just after Sark River that Sullane and Halcrest both pretend didn't happen.Tejain was trained by an upstart mage named Rindimar who insinuated himself into the government as a sort of secret weapons program. He was a horrible person - his training methods killed several ""promising"" students, and the rest either hated him or followed him slavishly. His unit of journeymen wizards - ""The Red Brigade""  - lost badly, and he himself was captured. There are rumors he now serves Halcrest in some function. His most loyal students don't believe this, and fight with the guerillas.Tejain has two younger sisters - young enough to actually adapt to their new lives, if given a chance. Tejain does care for them, to the extent that his father sometimes refers to him as ""my eldest daughter."""9/18/2017 7:58:42,Rarian Everfeth,Human,Paladin,"Rarian Everfeth grew up with a love for reading and learning. He soon became an apprentice librarian, and years after that, became one of the sole proprietors of one of the largest libraries available to the academic and arcane community. His constant immersion in literature, religion, history, and sciences gave him a wide knowledge of virtually anything books could teach him, as well as some of the darker things the library held in some locked shelves, such as books written in infernal and abyssal.Rarian's childhood friend became sick, and even with all of his knowledge, Rarian had no idea what could help his friend recover. After months of searching, and his friend only getting worse, he turned to something he never should have: a pact with a devil.The devil, once summoned, made a pact with Rarian. Rarian would help him pay off a debt and, in turn, the devil would give Rarian the knowledge he needed to save his friend. Once Rarian agreed, the devil revealed that his friend could not be saved, that it was too late, and then took his end of the bargain. The debt the devil held was one to a greater devil. The debt was one human soul. Rarian will lose his rights to his soul once he dies. The demon vanished, and soon after, Rarian left the archives, picked up the sword, calling upon the goddess of knowledge to help him seek vengeance, for his soul, and his friend. "9/18/2017 8:27:00,Finn Scalesly,Human,Rogue,"Finn was born in a large city in an influential province. Him and his best friend Gill have always dreamed of being treasure hunters. One day while reading in the library they learned of an ancient tomb, possibly unopened, nearby. The two journeyed out to it and determined that the seal on the entrance was unbroken. Excited to uncover new treasures, the two delved into the tomb, disarming the traps in the halls with ease. When they finally made it to the treasure room, they discovered that it had been looted. Someone had dug a tunnel into the back and taken all the gold. The only remaining bit of treasure was a golden ring on the finger of a skeletal lord. Gill removed the ring, and in doing so awoke all the skeletons in the room. They attacked him and killed him, ripping the flesh from his bones. Finn barely made it out alive. Unable to stand the thought of his best friend's fate, Finn re-entered the tomb a month later. Using tomb's existing traps and his superior wits Finn systematically killed all the skeletons over the course of a few days. When he finally made it into the treasure room again Finn came face to face with his best friend's skeleton. Without hesitation, he caved in Gill's skull with his crowbar, ending his undead servitude. As a final memento, Finn took the ring off Gill's finger and put it on his own, keeping it as a reminder of his friend. Now, he adventures not only for his own dreams, but for those of his fallen friend."9/18/2017 1:42:05,Lord Eduardo Vizzini,Human,Physician,"Although marrying outside of the noble bloodline is usually frowned upon the young Lord Alfredo courted a wealthy merchant's daughter (Isabella Argentaria). He finally gained his family's permission, but perhaps not total blessing, to marry her.  Their first child Calvados was a natural sportsman compared to the next child, Eduardo.  Eduardo after his studies became a rebel against the nobility and decided, against his parents wishes, to be with the comment man and become a physician.  Eduardo opened a free clinic and treated all comers.  Over this time he also developed an understanding of herbal remedies from local ‘witches’.  Eduardo is very protective of his younger sister Connie.Calvados joined the military but on his second campaign was slain by a mace blow to the head.  Barely alive Calvados was returned home, and Eduardo was sent for but it took a couple of days to find him as he was away herb collecting.  Calvados died several days later and Eduardo believes had he been there that he could have saved his brother.  Because of this he vowed to not leave this family again and setup a workshop in the noble court as a doctor.Connie was brought up to be a lady of the court, but like Eduardo, yearned for learning and became a student.  After meeting other like minded students Connie decided that work wasn’t really for her, or court life for that matter, and she has taken up with playwrights and poets in the city.  Her father and mother were not impressed to say the least.Recent events have ended in the vile attempted murder of Lady Isabella Vizzini and the disappearance of Lord Alfredo Vizzini..."9/17/2017 20:27:39,Wheezer,Human,Artificer,"The Wheezers were a family of artificers - grandfather, grandmother, two mothers and their partners, half a dozen kids.  They ran an extensive workshop outside of the Imperial capital; making wands and rings and amulets for the general market and a few homunculi to help make other things & to sell to high-end customers.  But it had been getting harder and harder to get supplies; due to the rebellion and the trade embargoes.  Then the Imperial regent announced an increase in taxes, to pay for expanding her palace as well as to fund yet another military expansion; and decreed that all artificers would retroactively pay those taxes for the years since she'd been made regent.When the Wheezers refused to pay, because they didn't have the cash or the goods for that, the regent ordered her enforcer; Commander Rubin; to take the workshop by force and ""make an example of them all"".The last time Wheezer saw his family - from his wife to his daughters to his grandkids - was when Rubin's wizard launched a fireball and the entire workshop went up like alchemist's fire.  Shadow, the best of the homunculi, had somehow gotten a wand of dimension door; grabbed Wheezer; and teleported them repeatedly away from the explosion.And that was how Wheezer began to work for the rebellion; and to plan eventual vengeance against now-General Rubin.Or at least, that's what Wheezer told the rebels; when they questioned him in a zone of truth.  The reality is a bit more complicated: Every member of his family was teleported away under the cover of the explosion.  They all made it out alive.  But they'll have to stay in hiding as long as Rubin and the regent are in power."9/18/2017 5:45:08,Elspeth Dharvoon,Human,Rogue,"Daughter of loving parents but raised in abject poverty near Waterdeep's docks, Elspeth was orphaned at the tender age of six after a bar fight erupted into a fire that engulfed their tenement. She was adopted by her aunt, who dabbled in some minor fence-work on the side of more reputable shop work, but fell under the sway of her eldest son Otilio, a thief and rogue who used a group of street children to orchestrate pickpocketing and robberies. Young Elspeth was not a skilled pickpocket or burglar, but she was naturally sweet and charming, making her ideal as a distraction, often playing the part of a lost child. Otilio later placed her in the home of a spoiled debutante, Elsa Brook, as a servant, where the bright and worldly young girl quickly became a confidante for the heiress. Otilio acted as a young nobleman from outside the city, wooing Lady Brook with his agent on the inside encouraging the affair. Once she had agreed to take his hand, Otilio provided poison for Lady Brook's father which Elspeth was to administer. Despite her misgivings, she went ahead with the plan and the new Lord Brook was set to inherit everything. He murdered his new wife, making it look like a suicide, and told Elspeth that she would be implicated in Lord Brook's murder if she spoke up. Then he banished her from the city on a ship set for Amn. En route, the ship was taken over by pirates who set the passengers adrift somewhere off the Sword Coast. With no home, family and only a small pouch of gold to her name, Elspeth took to adventuring to get back on her feet and, eventually, get her revenge on her treacherous and now-ennobled cousin. "9/18/2017 20:54:26,Leyland,Human,Paladin/Warlock Gestalt,"Leyland was a young man when he joined an order of paladins who policed the land and confronted evil. But like them, he was dogmatic and merciless and believed himself righteous above judgement. On one expedition he and his fellows came across an evil blade of the Shadowfell, which used a dark power to tempt them into seizing it. Some paladins were able to resist, but not those like Leyland, who were driven by ambition and fury instead of a righteous cause. The enthralled paladins slew their fellows, and then each other, to be the sole owner of the blade. Through luck, more than anything, Leyland triumphed and gained possession of the blade. Afterward, the madness passed and Leyland realized what he had done, but he found that the sword was bound to him and he could not discard it. Sickened by his actions and the revelation that he was not the incorruptible force for good that he had supposed, Leyland vowed to go into exile with the blade and live a life of peace.Decades later, an ageing Leyland was forced to break this vow when a great evil threatened the land. Using the dark blade, and with the help of other adventurers, he was able to save the inhabitants of a nearby village from a group of these villains. Leyland realized that he had a chance to atone by confronting this menace, and to put the sword to a noble purpose. United with his new companions, he swore a new paladin oath - this time driven by a sincere desire to do good, although he knew he could not promise that the sword would never be able to cause him to do harm again. But he has vowed to do all the good he can, and make right any wrongs he might cause. "9/18/2017 7:11:08,Jonah Belardo,Human,Cleric,"Jonah started sailing at sixteen. He got his first job as a crewman on a cargo ship. He spent the next few years hopping from ship to ship, finding work where he could. When Jonah was twenty, he began work on The Royal Fortune, a ship owned by a wealthy merchant Berrian Goldpetal. Jonah spent several years with this crew. He grew especially close to a Halfling named Cade Thorngage. The crew became dissatisfied with the small amount they were being paid to transport such expensive items. They were doing the most work while Goldpetal made by far the most money. Their anger was egged on by Cade and eventually culminated in a mutiny in which Captain Ironscale was killed by Jonah. The Royal Fortune spent over a decade as a pirate ship captained by Cade, and they terrorized a small section of sea in the south. They particularly targeted other ships owned by the Goldpetal Trading Company.  Jonah had the position of Quartermaster and commanded the ship while not in battle or actively searching for treasure. The ship was not far from the coast when it got caught unexpectedly in a powerful storm, worse than any any of the crew had seen before. The ship was destroyed. Jonah washed up on shore, badly injured, particularly his right leg which he would eventually lose to an infection. Jonah struggled to understand how he could have survived that storm which he assumed was a direct punishment from Melora. As far as he could tell, he was the only one that did. Jonah became convinced that Melora kept him alive for a purpose, to serve Her and atone for his past actions. As Jonah walked along the shore, collecting the few items from his old ship that had washed up, he found a ordinary looking blank book whose pages were somehow completely dry and undamaged. "9/18/2017 19:21:23,Len,Human,Nano,"Len grew up in a cult. His society lived in caves in a great steep-sided mountain, and developed ways to hide themselves from the world. They were the last survivors of a race long thought to be extinct, and they knew many things. As a child, he cooked and sang and studied with his mother, counted sums and wove images with the golden priests. From his brothers he learned how to smuggle a mouse into a bed, throw a rotten fruit through a window, or make a terrifying beast manifest in a bedroom. One warm day in autumn, he went out to play in the leaves and fell asleep until dusk. He came back and found all the people had gone. A bitter-smelling purple powder was scattered everywhere. It made him cough and he went home to bed but nobody was there and the powder was there, too, and he woke up sick. He wandered the mountain in the full moon, burning with fever. He slept by a waterfall and a lonely road. Someone carried him. He woke up in a cart in a big village full of tall curving buildings and endless rushing people, and he ran away. A kind woman gave him food. A strange dog bit him and he screamed at it and shoved it away with his mind and its face came off.  At fifteen, Len has been in the city for six years. He is small for his age, half-starved, and frequently covered in bruises. He speaks with a bizarre accent that nobody’s ever heard before, and his pale skin looks forever out of place, but he knows where to beg and where to steal. He lives in condemned building with a small group of similar boys. He is starting to accumulate a few possessions and think in the long term. His highest aspiration is to have money and safety. "9/18/2017 6:48:15,Trar Dewstream,Human,Druid,"Deep in the heart of the Karthas Mountains, there lies a small village of outcasts. Made up of elves, orcs, half-orcs and humans from the surrounding area, this nature worshiping village carves out a meager living off of the land and by offering their skills as guides through the surrounding area. It is in this town that Trar Dewstream was born and raised. Born to human parents, he learned from his druid father to respect nature, care for animals, and how to earn a living as a guide to those looking for passage through the mountains. Not one to care too much for the city dwellers in the valley below, he spent most of his years communing with nature and learning the ways of the wild. That is until his 26th year. A Peryton came down from the mountains and kidnapped Trar's parents while he was in the settlement of Glasspring after just finishing guiding a group down from the mountains. Returning to his village and hearing of the deaths by the beast, Trar left on a quest for revenge. It took a year of mapping the mountains and tracking down rumors to discover the creatures lair. Roosting high in a hidden mountain forest, a mating pair and their two offspring had made a nest. Here, Trar found the remains of his parents. Flying into a rage, he killed the foul beasts without mercy. Taking a trophy from the creature, a stag horn from the head of the beast, he set up a home in the forest to mourn the loss of his parents and commune with nature. Here he had his first vision of the disaster that was coming. For three years he prepared, honing his druid abilities, haunted nightly by the visions of the cataclysm. Until another vision came. A vision that took him down from the mountains to the outskirts of the great city of Waterford."9/18/2017 2:24:24,Eris Nilodian,Human,Scout/Ranger/Dervish,"Eris Nilodian is a human scout/ranger from the Elvish Northlands. Eris’ parents are part of The Order of Al’Asran, based out of Trezna. The Order of Al’Asran is a small, secret, militant, secular sect of undead-haters that chose to name themselves after one of Pelor’s aliases solely to signify their commitment to eliminating all undead in the Northlands. Though the Order of Al’Asran itself is secular, members are not required to be non-religious. The Order of Al’Asran was founded by the nobles of Trezna, who created it as a means to an end in order to eliminate the lich Xanaphia Siannodel. However, Xanaphia is well-protected by the people, and so the Order has yet to confront her at all. Most of the tireless efforts of the Order have only gone toward destroying minor undead in the area.Eris was raised within the Order, and her speed and dexterity made her a fine candidate to be trained beside scouts and rangers. Before she was old enough to begin her class training Eris developed a passion for dance, and that passion heavily influenced her goals for her career – she has known that she wanted to be a dervish, just like some of the quickest and most cunning combatants in the Order, since she was a child.Eris left Trezna two years before she met The Raiders of the Forsaken Dragon on the aisle of Zegara. She has been traveling, with the Order’s blessing, to broaden her experiences so that she may return with the power and wisdom to bring down Xanaphia once and for all. She was drawn to Keshiki four months before meeting The Raiders, and has spent the last two months in Zegara completing quests for the Zegaran Adventurer’s Guild to increase her skills and acquire the funds to buy new equipment. She has a fiery hatred of the undead, and a singular, overarching commitment to becoming a weapon against them."9/17/2017 23:51:57,Kano,Human,monk,"In his younger days Kano was a petty criminal. That career came to end when a local street gang, annoyed by the freelancer stepping on their territory, ambushed him and beat him within an inch of his life. Kano was pretty skilled with his bare hands, and managed to take out a few of his assailants. Before long though, he was overpowered by the thugs. The last thing Kano remembered from the fight was a quarterstaff sweeping in take out one of the gang members.Coming to after the fight, Kano was greeted by a monk sitting cross legged on the footpath beside his body. The monk explained that Kano had done pretty well in the fight, all things considered, and that the Monastery of Standing Stone was always looking for people that could fight. I didn't  seem like there was very much left for Kano in this town, and the Monastery had skilled healers. Kano took up the Monk's offer. At first he wanted only to train enough to come back and destroy the gang that had attacked him. Over the course of his time at the Monastery he learned to control his instinct for vengeance. Instead, he has dedicated his life to the Monastery's mission of protecting the weak and allowing order and good to flourish in the world. For the most part, the Monks of The Standing Stone achieve this goal by doing good deeds, or perhaps standing up to criminal gangs and would-be tyrants. Kano is special, one of a hand full of field agents free to follow their instincts and fight darkness where ever they find it.Kano's training has allowed him to master his own greed and need for validation or renown. However, he still struggles on control his emotions when he sees people without power being mistreated. Thus, he is likely to act rashly in order to save a few people immediately, even when a more thought-out approach might save others from suffering."9/18/2017 7:38:05,Razalas,Human,Wizard,"Razalas was born in the Turmish Republic, in the capital city of Alaghôn. Their mother was an actor who achieved minor success on the stage, but turned out to be a great success as an officer of the Turmish Guild of Theatrical Entertainers, eventually serving a term in the Assembly of Stars. (Their father was one of the best musicians in the city who specialized in esoteric forms too obscure to ever achieve much financial success, but made a comfortable living playing for festivals.) She installed in her child a passion for strong guilds and republican democracy, and a love for--if not talent in--the theater. Razalas early on displayed an aptitude for the arcane arts, and after exhausting the magical training available in Alaghôn (and despite their mother’s dismay that they would never tread the boards), went on to study at the Jedea Academy in Mordulkin, followed by a research position at Candlekeep. They might have gone on to a quiet life of research, unremarked upon except by their fellow specialists in Abjuration, if it were not for their ardent syndicalism and inability to leave a mystery alone.  Razalas happened to learn that Lord Frath, a minor scion of the noble Belt family, had conspired to cheat members of the Drovers and Teamsters Guild out of their due payment for a delivery. In their attempts to redress this grievance, their investigation eventually revealed a plot involving arms smuggling, infiltration by the Red Wizards of Thay, and fiendish corruption of several nobles and government officials in the Gate region. This drew the attention of the Harpers and left Razalas now unsuited for the stuffy confines of academia. While their lack of guile would ensure Razalas would never be a master of spycraft, the Harpers were impressed with their zeal and talent for investigation, as well as their considerable arcane prowess. Now Razalas is an agent at large for the Harpers, preserving knowledge and fighting the abuses of the powerful."9/18/2017 13:06:03,Evelynn,Human,Cleric,"Evelynn has blocked out her childhood memories prior to the age of seven, when the house fire in Brindol killed her parents.  Her first real memory is actually that of being pulled from the burning wreckage of her home by her twin brother, Mezzo, and being left at the Church of Pelor.  She has no recollection of the beatings she received at the hands of her father or the fact that Mezzo himself set the fire.The quiet life at the Church of Pelor suited Evelynn.  The clerics taught her how to read and write, a skill she later passed on to Mezzo on the select occasions when he came to visit.  She also quickly picked up the basics of how to treat those afflicted with sickness and disease, and showed surprising skill with healing magics.  Because of Evelynn’s talent, she was often allowed to accompany the priests on short missionary trips outside the city walls, where she helped to spread the word of Pelor and gave succor to those in need.However, as Evelynn aged, she found herself losing interest in the Church of Pelor’s doctrines.  She began attending services at other temples in Brindol with the hopes of finding a new god or goddess to dedicate herself to, but was unable to identify with any of their teachings.  It wasn’t until Mezzo exposed her to the tenets of the Raven Queen and Evelynn realized she knew the cold hand of fate firsthand that she found her true calling in life.	Believing that everything is predetermined and that circumstances occur in order to guide her throughout her life, Evelynn fled Brindol with her brother after his troubles with the law.  She considers herself indebted to Mezzo for showing her the “true” way in life and is reluctant to leave him for more than a few hours at a time.  Evelynn does not agree with all of what Mezzo does, however, and hopes to someday guide him to a less violent path."9/18/2017 13:30:11,Onan Bakkal,Human,Warlock,"Onan had a grandmother who fell ill. No cleric or druid could diagnose her ailment; it seemed a supernatural sickness, and her last few days were in anguish. He spent what time he could with his fading grandmother in her last days. A very unpleasant experience, as the woman he knew and loved now seemed vacant. Her identity, health, and sanity drained. One day, feeling in his heart that he had little time to say goodbye, he rushed to visit his grandmother one last time.As he entered her room, he found not his grandmother, but some other being, hunchbacked and foul. She stood next to his grandmother’s empty bed. The last thing Onan saw was this old crone drop his grandmother’s heirloom ring into a pouch on her belt, and then vanish in thin air. The theft of the ring robbed him of all he’d had left of his grandmother’s faded memory. Onan learned what he could of this creature: not much. His one lead was a tale set in the moorlands with a villainous witch matching her description.Onan begged to accompany his merchant father, Metin Bakkal, on the way to Duragzhar. When passing through the moorlands Onan wandered off on his own, hoping to find the foul creature who killed his grandmother. He lost his way and was never seen by his family again. He was taken in by druids and attempted to learn their ways, but was never successful. During a coming of age ceremony, he was made to wander the moors alone. He came across some ruins whose strange nature put him in a trance and opened his mind to the power of the Great One. Though he knows little of the Great One, its power flows through him. When he returned, the druids recognized an unnatural power emanating from him and exiled him from the moors.After leaving, he made his way to Duragzhar where he was able to put his warlock powers to use working in black market trades, smuggling, and treasure hunting."9/18/2017 15:57:17,Mathis Greywood,Human,Cleric,"""You want to know about me.  Fine.I'm from a small village you've never heard of.  Because it's gone now.  See, it existed on the edge of what turned out to be a rather nasty forest.  So nasty in fact that the village had its own small group of druids to protect us from the forest and what was in it.  When I was young, I was apprenticed to join those druids.But then the war happened.  And his royal dipshitness needed every man and strong lad capable of bearing arms to rebuild his losses from being a dumbass.  So I ""joined"" the army.  And I ""fought"" in the war.  And I survived because I made a noise at the right time while clerics were searching for the dying among the dead on the battlefield.  I don't know why they did it at the time, espeically since I wasn't on their side.  Now.  Now it'd probably some phrase along the lines of ""a dead soldier learns nothing from his time in battle"".So I recuperated under the care of a cleric of The Red Knight, until I was healthy enough to be a prisoner until the war ended.  And then I went home.  But there was no home to return to.  The forest had reclaimed it while I was gone.  No where else to go, I sought out the cleric of The Red Knight again and ""enlisted"" as a follower of the goddess of war.  Now don't give me that look.  They don't call her ""Our Lady of Strategy"" for nothing.  They could tell I was a shit soldier even without my own first hand account of how shit I actually was.  But experience and healers make good soldiers into better ones.  So I studdied medicine, and tactics, and served my time as a front lines healer.  And now that I'm out, I hire on with any adventurers trying to do good.  Well, the ones that don't seem to be completely lacking a brain cell between them, at any rate."""9/18/2017 2:23:46,Merry Wrenwright,Human,Hexblade,"Merry Wrenwright was born in the bustling metropolis of Bichi to a retired mercenary (Anthony Wrenwright) and an independent courtesan of minor renown (Luna Misteye). Merry's life has been shaped by unfortunate events borne from her budding magic, her young adulthood peppered by incidents of bad luck and loss.Around the beginning of her puberty Merry's peers began noticing that her presence usually guaranteed that someone would get hurt a lot more than usual; when Merry came out to play bruises and cuts rarely occurred, but instead more severe injuries were the norm: sprained ankles, dislocated shoulders, and broken bones. The children began avoiding her, causing Merry to spend the bulk of her time alone or with her little brother, Thomas. When Merry was 12 she lost track of 4-year-old Thomas as he played on a busy side street, catching sight of him just in time to witness him trip and fall beneath a runaway wagon.Heartbroken at the loss of their youngest child, Anthony and Luna made a special effort to invest in Merry's development, passing on their wisdom to her. While Merry's mother made an effort to direct her in channeling rudimentary arcane abilities, Merry grew especially close to her father as he taught her about the arts of combat and gambling. All of the time that she would have spent playing with other children was instead spent developing her martial prowess. Over the years Merry grew into a relatively solitary adult, eschewing friendship in favor of a life free of commitments and intimate entanglements with anyone except her family.Merry's father introduced her to a number of contacts throughout the city, and at 17 she began working for them as muscle for hire, usually performing small jobs like debt collection, protection, and intimidation. Anthony died of a fatal stab wound from a mugging months later, and Merry moved out of her mother's home into a shabby room above a blacksmith's shop. Merry received her mysterious letter on the day she turned 19, and departed from Bichi without telling her mother she was leaving town."9/18/2017 13:05:29,Elise,Human,Cleric,"	Elise has little recollection of her parents, as they both were killed during Szass Tam’s abortive attempt to become immortal and live without his phylactery when she was a toddler.  Orphaned on the streets of Eltabbar, she was discovered outside the church of Ilmater by the prelate, L’eric Wrightsdale.  She lived with L’eric and the other Ilmatari for several weeks, as the undead threat in the country became increasingly worse.  Eventually one of the Chosen of Ilmater, known only as “the Soft,” moved the main church of Ilmater out of the hazardous location of Thay to the town of Riverdale, south of Waterdeep.  Accompanying “the Soft,” L’eric was reunited with his sister, Erin Wrightsdale, the current head of the church of St. Evelith of the White Gardenia in Riverdale.	Knowing that she had no living family and no place to go, L’eric decided to keep Elise with him in Riverdale.  After several years growing up in town as a normal child should, Elise was no longer recognizable as the scared, malnourished youth that had taken shelter with the church of Ilmater in Eltabbar.  She showed surprising promise with divine magic and quickly took to Ilmater’s tenets, perhaps as a result of having seen suffering firsthand.  Upon Elise’s sixteenth birthday, both L’eric and Erin were pleased to formally accept her as an Adorned in the ranks of the Ilmatari.  The church of St. Evelith of the White Gardenia has a history of accepting orphaned children into their fold, so their subsequent adoption of Elise was not considered unusual.  It was then that Elise’s real training began.Forgoing the traditional method of fighting unarmed as the Chosen Evelith had, Elise trained with an elite group of blunt weapon wielding warriors under L’eric’s guidance.  Known as the “Painbearers of the Pure,” they act as the fighting arm of the church of the White Gardenia, going on covert missions to punish those who harm others.  After four years of intense instruction, Elise was given her first assignment.  Instead of being tasked to secretly eliminate a tyrannical leader, she was instead to search for any information or evidence regarding the disappearance of Evelith, who had gone missing a year before."9/18/2017 15:23:16,Fellan,Human,Bard,"Fellan has dedicated her life to recording and sharing the history of her tribe. Libraries and scriptoriums would not survive long in the lush rain forests of Bhiena, so this history is not recorded in dusty tomes or hidden scriptoriums. Instead, Fellan herself is a repository for her ancestor's wisdom. As one of the Lore Keepers, she preserves this history in songs, epic poems, plays and stories passed from one generation to the next. The Lore Keepers are an important part of Bheinan society. In addition to sharing their knowledge with the tribe at large, they council their chiefs and perform for the governing council. They are shrewd political operators in their own right, and the particular stories or songs they share at a given meeting are carefully chosen. Fellan loves the thrill of performing her works. Though she takes her formal role very seriously, she get's a great deal of joy from launching into a song or recalling a memorable line from a poem at less formal social gatherings. She is very socially adept, and finds it easy to navigate Bhienan society and bring almost anyone around to her way of thinking. Though she knows many stories of heroes conquering wild places, she has never had any desire to be in one. She is happiest in society and has not enjoyed the wilderness on the few occasions she has been subjected to it.As the first born of Berlon, another Lore Keeper, Fellan was brought up be a Lore Keeper. From an early age she received training in performance and learned the stories and songs that recorded the ancient knowledge. She never could pick up an instrument, but she shone as an actor and story teller and could sing well enough to get by. Before long she was playing for audiences, and even before the chief of her tribe. As she has matured she has taken up a more senior role among the Lore Keepers, and is know part of the inner circle of the group and is teaching new initiates.Her life has largely been dedicated to her own tribe, she has never been beyond Bhiena and only travels outside of her tribe's lands to attend the annual governing council.

Ever since she left on that final adventure of hers, and even more when we found out she'll never return, I've felt empty. And anything I do doesn't make it better. I've felt the way she described feeling since she told me she was pregnant with you.Don't get me wrong, we were both overjoyed. And she was determined to give you the proper raising her parents never gave her. She loved you so much, no one can begin to understand. But she had to leave on one last trip after ten years of none. She promised it wouldn't take long, and she cried as much as you did. But I couldn't stop her.And even knowing what I know now, knowing that I'd never see her again, I couldn't stop her. Not just because of her stubbornness, but I couldn't keep her away from what made her truly happy.This is hurting as much as it's hurting you, but I have to do the same. I have to see what was so alluring to her, I have to go on these adventures she loved so much.You're your own woman now, I've taught you all that I know. All you need is experience, and you'll be better than I ever was. You can manage the shop yourself. You're strong, gods you're strong. You finally beat me, didn't you? That smile on your face was the widest I've ever seen on you. It suits you you know. Don't ever stop. You have your mother's face, my eyes, but her face. Did I ever tell you that? You're so much like her, without the sense of adventure of course.I suppose it's kind of funny when I think about it, I thought you'd be the one who'll eventually write this letter. But no, adventure's not for you. You have a smithy to operate! And you love it as much as I do, or as much as your mother loved you-know-what.At the beginning I said she'll never return. I was wrong, she's always with us. She gave me her bug, and you, everything else.I love you,Don't hate me,Dad"9/17/2017 23:11:54,Bella Marchand,Human,Fighter,"After her mother died, Belle's father took her to a small village in an attempt to find a soft, lovely place where they could both heal and escape the memories of the past. Unfortunately, it was not long after they arrived that they discovered the woods were much more sinister than any they had ever seen. A darkness was creeping over the land, and soon packs of wolves twisted by dark magic prowled closer and closer to the settlement, making leaving the village next to impossible. They made a life for themselves, even if Belle constantly chafed at the rest of the villagers, considering them stupid and shallow. She dreamed of the day she could leave, but did not expect that day to come in the form of her father disappearing into the woods. Loathe to tell Gaston or anyone else of her plans, and convinced she could handle the situation herself, she trailed her father to the castle deep in the woods and confronted the monster within. While tales of heroic sacrifice and impossible romance in her head, she agreed to stay in the castle forever if her father was set free, unable to comprehend what horrors awaited her. The prince of the castle was no fairytale prince, and he cared not for her attempts at kindness. She was chained to a demonic altar as a virgin sacrifice when Gaston burst in, the magnanimous hero come to save her, the damsel in distress, the very thing she'd always loathed and swore never to become. In that moment, she honestly didn't know which was worse: being sacrificed to open a portal to hell, or having to witness Gaston save her and then never shut up about it. By time he listened to her angry screams and released her, every evil thing was already dead, every mirror smashed, and there was nothing left to take out her rage on except her own psyche. Her belief in romance and fairy tales died in that castle as well, and while she still found Gaston to be boorish and pigheadedly misogynistic, she found she didn't care nearly as much as she used to. When Gaston, Claudette, and Scarlett set plans to leave the village to go ""adventuring,"" Belle asked to join them. At least finally she would get out, even if she now knew there was nothing out there but more blood and ichor."9/18/2017 6:09:56,C. Sativa,Human,Druid,"C. Sativa was content with his life, living in the woods outside a village in the Southern Wildlands. They seemed inappropriately named to him, as the days passed peacefully, and saw him growing herbs and foraging for mushrooms to sell to the locals.He kept himself to himself, but he didn’t mind that; he was happy to spend his evenings enjoying his own produce. He spent so much time in the woods there was even a rumour that he was part tree himself. When asked, he would rub unusually calloused hands together and smile slightly and ask “How would that work, then?” And if anyone asked what the C stood for in his name, he would say “secret” and no-one would pull him up on his spelling.But he was well-liked nonetheless. If the local Baron thought that maybe the herbs Sativa sold to the villagers made them a bit… relaxed, then he turned a blind eye, since the mushrooms Sativa sold to the Baron were sure to make a party go with a bang.One day, all that changed.He noticed the smell first, as though an enormous bonfire had been lit nearby. At first he thought there was a party that he had forgotten about. But then he heard shouts, and they weren’t shouts of joy. He climbed a tree and looked across to the village.The Baron’s castle was a ruin. The village was ablaze. Dead bodies were everywhere. And approaching, very close already, were dozens of bugbears wielding swords and axes and clad in rusty armour.Bugbears run fast, and they had already seen him, and who knows how many more there were spread through the woods? It is likely the only thing which saved him was an overeager bugbear bearing a flaming torch. It grinned, and thrust the firebrand into Sativa’s latest crop. Smoke billowed. Bugbears coughed and stumbled. Even Sativa, with his high tolerance, felt faint.Disliking violence, and with nothing to stay for, he stepped over the now-snoring bugbears and salvaged what he could - some clothes, food, and a half kilo of his finest greenery and a stock of seeds.Now, he travels the land, hoping to find a new home. To his astonishment, few places are grateful for his skill in herb growing and mushroom gathering, and he finds himself run out of town after town.One day, he hopes to find a place where he can be happy again."9/17/2017 19:11:07,Danell Razzberry,human,bard,"Danell was a street urchin for most of his childhood, up until the revolution.  When Magenta's outer city fell into a state of civil unrest and eventually all-out war following the assassination of the king in the inner city by the visitors from another universe, Danell and his fellow kids formed a gang of child soldiers to help defend the townspeople from the royal guard, who had begun to be increasingly harsh, blaming the townspeople for the king's death.  Eventually a group of mercenary ex-artisans recruited the kids into a formal role in the war, and Danell personally helped to steal supplies from the barracks and run them to the city through the sewage lines.  In doing so, he befriended a flutemaker who happened to be a retired bard, Geo Nester, who taught Danell the basics of bardistry and even introduced him to the last surviving member of the group of outsiders.During a particularly important raid, one member of the group of artisans betrayed the group to the guards for a paltry sum, and the children were all captured.  Just as Danell was about to be executed, Geo and a few other artisans stormed the courtyard.  They were killed within minutes, but this gave Geo and a few of the other children time to escape.  Danell was supposed to meet up with the others, but he instead ran back to try to at least bury Geo's body — only to find it had already been fed to the wild animals.  He went back to the spot where they were supposed to meet, but nobody was there.  The gang of child soldiers was no more.  Some consolation could be found, however, in the fact that their “side” of the revolution, spearheaded by a relatively small religious group, did end up winning.After the city settled into order, renaming itself Fuchsia and forbidding any mention of Magenta, Danell was eventually recruited to the new city watch, where he worked to protect the citizens.  He would use his position to help out those less fortunate, and while not a major political player, was a member of a political organization devoted to easing the burden off the lower classes (so as to prevent another civil war).  He honed his skills at both the flute and the rapier, as well as practicing and improving the bardic magic taught by Geo.Until one day, when he would be assigned to a very important mission…"9/18/2017 11:12:02,Ander Brightwood,Human,Fighter,"Ander Brightwood grew up as the son of a farmer in a nameless village. His life was mundane and simple, the normal life of a peasant.At the age of 16 Ander was conscripted into the army of a passing lord, forever changing his life. There is a need for more than soldiers in an army and Ander's stocky build and history with animals made him a good choice for the wagon trains that kept up with the army. He honed his ability to drive wagons and cook. He also picked up some of the Halfling language from the friendly folk that accompanied him.After a particularly bloody battle, Ander was pulled from the teamsters to fill a gap in the line. Despite his easy going demeanor and less than average intelligence, he became an adept spearman and would continue to serve in the line for several years.Ander's sergeant saw promise in the young boy and recommended him for training with sword and shield. Here, his size and strength made him a formidable soldier. He would attain the rank of corporal and become the standard bearer for his unit. He served with distinction and pride until and ambush his unit was caught in the path of dueling wizards on a battlefield. The group of swordsmen rushed to attack the enemy sorcerer, but most of them were burned alive by firebolts. Ander, dismayed by the deaths of his comrades around him, planted his banner and charged. Miraculously, he was not hit in the melee around him and was able to slay the mage.A promotion to the rank of sergeant was Ander's reward for surviving the battle, but he saw little point in continuing with the army. He had lost too much.After mustering out, returning home was Ander's goal. Unfortunately, being from an unnamed village and lacking the ability to read made for a difficult return journey.After wandering for a year and spending most of his funds from the army, Ander settled for mercenary work and a life of tavern gambling.When he sleeps, his dreams are a constant reminder of the oceans of blood he has waded through, but this does not deter his will to fight if he thinks it is for the greater good. He carries a piece of the robe from the wizard that wiped out his unit and harbors a hatred for combat magic and sorcerers. His combat experience makes him an adept fighter and his rank of sergeant proves that he is a leader of men."9/18/2017 14:21:21,Avric Tholomyes,Human,Fighter,"Avric was born the second son of innkeepers in the south of the country of Thaver. When war came to Thaver, both Avric and his elder brother Felix joined the army, Avric as a footsoldier, Felix, who was more intellectually gifted, as a Lieutenant. The war lasted for 6 years, and when it was over, Thaver was defeated. There wasn't much glory or use for the defeated soldiers in a lost war, so Avric was left to serve as a day laborer in the town of Parrick. He could not afford a house, so he rented a room in the inn. He was a jovial sort, and managed to brighten the common room with his presence, which the innkeepers appreciated. He wrote to his brother often. After a couple years, however, a new road was made in Thaver, and traders passed less and less through Parrick. With fewer traders, the wages of a laborer grew less and less. He stopped responding to his brother's letters. Eventually, the jobs became scarce and Avric fell unemployed, and soon thereafter, homeless. During a rainstorm, Avric broke into the local temple for shelter and a place to sleep. Come morning, the Priest saw him and took pity on him, and hired him to work around the temple, and offered him lodgings and food. Avric never was much for religion, especially after the war, but the priest's kindness inspired something in him, and he devoted himself to caring for the temple. About a year later, the priest died and a new priest was brought in to shepherd the town. The new priest was not fond of Avric and threw him to the streets. Angry that his devotion was rewarded with such an injustice, Avric once again broke into the temple, and the new priest called the guards on him. He was arrested and sent to the regional prison, where he was cellmates with a halfling Jonn. Avric was a man of great stature, and as such he required more food than the prisoners' allowance. Jonn, as a halfling, did not need as much, and was inclined to share his meals. The two became friends soonafter. Five years into his imprisonment, there was a riot at the prison. Avric decided not to take part in it, but Jonn was killed in the battle. From then on Avric became much more solitary and cut off from the world. At the end of his ten year prison sentence, Avric was a broken man. He had no wealth to his name and a lifetime of weariness. The only thing he was ever any good at, in his mind, was fighting, so he became a mercenary, and traveled through the towns to look for work."9/18/2017 13:10:31,Shaelyn d'Lyrandar,Human,Sorceress,"The youngest child and only daughter of Vennic and Alis d’Lyrandar, Shaelyn was born in the island city of Stormhome, the seat of House Lyrandar in Aundair.  Though stemming from an obscure branch of the Lyrandar bloodline, Shaelyn’s parents were longstanding members of the Windwrights Guild and raised their children to be as comfortable on dry land as on the deck of an elemental galleon.Expected to follow in her older brothers’ footsteps working as crew or dockside support for the elemental galleons and airships of House Lyrandar, Shaelyn was instead apprenticed into the Windwrights Guild after her Mark of Storm manifested at age thirteen.  Though her parents were at first disappointed that her arcane and navigation training would take her away from them and Stormhome, they quickly came around after realizing that Shaelyn would now be in a position to brush shoulders with some of the more powerful members of House Lyrandar in Sharn.After arriving in Sharn, Shaelyn was set up with one of the masters of the Windwrights Guild to begin her in-depth training.  Loraste was considered an expert, though a bit extreme in his teaching methods.  Shaelyn was quickly tossed into a “sink or swim” situation to learn a mix of everything – how to control the elements, predict and change the weather, minute details of navigation, and the finer points of sailing.  In her off time, she was expected to take geography classes a Morgrave University, and to study the many, many maps in the extensive library. With the end of the Last War and the current state of peace in Khorvaire, the viceroy of Lyrandar’s affairs in Sharn, Solia d’Lyrandar, decided that it was high time for the newest crop of recruits to begin hands-on training.  Under the guidance of Loraste, Shaelyn has spent the last few months as an apprentice navigator on several elemental galleons and airships voyaging in and out of Sharn.In addition to gaining practical knowledge of sailing and navigation, these trips taught Shaelyn other important skills.  She learned how to mediate between crews and captains, placate angry passengers, and to make small repairs.  She also learned more about Baron Esravash d’Lyrandar, the young and bold female head of House Lyrandar, and has dreamed about gaining prestige within the house through discovery of new experimental magic weapons for naval use.After returning from one such trip for a well-earned week of shore leave, Shaelyn bumped into two friends she had made while living in Sharn – Pippin and (Guid’s character).  Knowing that they would enjoy a getaway, she convinced the two to (stow away/buy a ticket/whatever fits with their backgrounds).  This pleasure cruise will be Shaelyn’s last as an apprentice under Loraste before being conferred the rank of navigator within the Windwright’s Guild."9/18/2017 12:11:45,Bronze Fury,human,barbarian,"He calls himself Bronze Fury, though it's unclear if that's what others in his clan called him or if it's a nickname of his own devising. Bronze Fury is young, rash, and thirsting for glory. A compact young man, wandering to prove himself, he comes from a proud race, the people of the dragon. They live on sere and rocky land, the northern face of Naemara's central mountain range.  They make a yearly trek up and down the north-western coast of Naemara. His war pick is really a native weapon, used for climbing, digging, and killing. Bronze Fury carries a chip on his shoulder. People do not like him when he's angry. Bronze Fury longs for the simpler time of his heroes, brave warriors of the tribe who defeated their enemies and protected their clan. These days his matriarchal society emphasizes trade and the precepts of society. Even the men, traditionally raised for an ordered defense of the tribe or foraging sorties into the jungle now end up fishing and gathering more than the women. So Bronze Fury takes his strength and his pride and strikes out his own path, as did the heroes of legends. He knows he will have a special place in his clan's history, he must first prove himself out in the world. Bronze Fury seeks renown and glory. The old stories tell of dragons, or at least one dragon, who patronized the People of the Dragon, visiting its rulership from across the sea. In a lot of ways the tribe of today reflects the ancient one subservient to the dragons: they are a LG nomadic tribe of ~200 humans that migrate between the frigid north then down south and west to the sea, staying in the foothills. They have close ties to the dwarves found under these mountains. The more mystically-inclined seek out the Renmul wood elves to learn their craft. The People of the Dragon used to be thought of as barbarians by the humans who inhabit the fishing villages of the coast and the outposts in the mountains, though in the last century they have gained some acceptance. This has been an active pursuit of the People, as they moved to adopt more modern ways. Some families have even settled permanently and taken up agriculture. Historically, the People have used the phrase ""seeking a dragon"" literally to mean searching for a dragon guardian for wisdom and guidance. Nowadays the phrase has a derogatory connotation, and refers to when a young tribesman does not agree with the Mothers, sometimes striking off to forge their own way. But in Bronze Fury's great-grandmother's stories to ""seek a dragon"" is to go find find yourself and prove your bravery. This is what Bronze Fury plans to do.

The child was their illegitimate child born out of wedlock, and now that Sabira had birthed her, Sabira wanted nothing to do with her or with Aseir. Aesir took their child, and named her Vaalia. Unlike the mother of his child, he was instantly smitten with her, and vowed she would have a happy life. Vaalia had a happy, but mediocre upbringing, with her father rising through the guild artisan ranks to become a high-ranking guild artisan. Vaalia, however, had no interest in the world of the artisans, and found herself drawn to the arcane. Encouraging her scholarly pursuits, Aesir sought out a kindly wizard for her to study under. She was sent to live in the neighbouring town, under the tutelage of the wizard, away from her father, though they wrote often. Whilst she enjoyed and excelled in the scholarly aspects of her apprenticeship, and became fast friends with his other apprentice, she was dismayed to learn that her own magical capabilities were non-existent. The wizard, kind as he was, could do nothing to help her use magic. When Vaalia received news that her father was ill, the wizard sent her home with a potion to cure him, and the grave news that perhaps she was never meant to use magic. Distressed, she travelled back through the woods to her home town. She carried the potion, and some food in a basket, with the wizard assuring that he would send on the rest of her belongings in the morning, when they could arrange a cart and protection for it. In her haste and the dimming light of the setting sun, Vaalia tripped over a root, breaking her basket and along with it, the potion with the cure. As she watched all the potion sink into the ground, forever lost to her, a stranger appeared. A seemingly kind fellow, he offered to help her in exchange for some favours. The man offered his hand, seemingly to help her up, and as she took it he gave her a sly grin that revealed his arch fey nature. As she felt new magic course through her, she realised that she unwittingly entered into a pact with a fey.  When he withdrew her hand, she was left with a small crystal in her palm, and an empty forest. When Vaalia made it home, she administered her father’s potion, and he made a swift recovery. She stayed for some time to care for him, but eventually the time came for Vaalia to leave her home town and strike out into the world to see what else she could learn about magic, warlock pacts and the fey. "9/17/2017 20:55:34,Nyiah,Human,Warlock,"Nyiah grew up in a small village on the borders of the Eldwin Forest. Her father was a blacksmith and her mother a leatherworker. She spent the majority of her childhood either in her fathers shop, watching the forge fire or out playing in the woods with her best friend Loric. As she got older she became fascinated with fire, getting in trouble frequently for setting fires, though she was always careful not to let them damage other people’s property or harm anyone. Soon she discovered she had a spark for magic, able to perform small tricks and start small flames with a click of her finger. The only person she shared this secret with was her friend Loric, now grown up somewhat into a handsome young man. Soon they grew from friends to lovers and on Nyiah’s 16th birthday they were married in the town. Loric worked with Nyiah’s father as an apprentice blacksmith while Nyiah worked as a washerwoman to save up for a house. Soon she fell pregnant, and the couple moved into a house a few months before she gave birth to a child she named Emma. She continued working to provide for her daughter and the three of them lived happily together. A year later she was pregnant again and she hoped for a boy. One day as she was delivering a load of clean washing to her neighbour she heard a cry of alarm come from the towns edge and turned to see the sky turning red and grey from flames and smoke. Throwing the clothes to the ground she ran towards her house. As she approached, her worst fears were realised. Her house stood aflame, surrounded by bandits carrying torches and wicked axes. She screamed and threw fire before dashing inside with no fear for her own safety. “Emma! Loric!” Inside she found her parents, consumed by flame, ignoring the flames licking her skins she rushed back outside in time to see Loric being cut down by a bandit as her daughter screamed. Nyiah fired a bolt of fire at the bandit and killed him instantly as another bandit picked the crying Emma of the ground and drove a knife through the child’s body. Nyiah was consumed with rage and the flames around her swelled to cover her body, lashing out, she sent waves of fire through the entire town, incinerating townsfolk and bandits alike, when she came too nothing but ash and bones remained. Feeling a great pain in her stomach she looked down to find her legs covered in blood, an arrow imbedded in her belly and her unborn child miscarried.In the years to follow Nyiah wandered the wilds, killing bandits and other beings that threatened innocent villagers, soon she found herself in Tor amol, searching for something."9/18/2017 13:01:43,Calanthe,Human,Alchemist,"Calanthe “Callie” Tommard was born and raised in Yalistar and is the only child of Janna and Arden Tommard. She spent her younger years helping her mother with her apothecary and learning about herbalism from anyone willing to entertain her questioning. On the days that Callie spent in the forest with her father, a woodsman, she would try to bring back odd items including plant and animal parts, minerals, and colorful insects. Eventually these collections became harmless decoctions and infusions as Callie experimented making tonics, play-acting that she was one of the famous druid healers of Yalistar. Her reclusive nature hindered making friends with the other children of the city, and she had a relatively lonely childhood until her teenage years. Fed up with Callie’s antisocial behavior, her parents forced her to travel to Mandilin for a month to visit her cousins during the summer, coinciding with the Drawbridge Festival.It was during one of these month-long visits, made every year, that Callie met Bronwyn Ryll and Finnegan Dunn. Bronwyn bullied Callie into joining their game of hoodsman’s blind and though Callie disliked the other girl’s strong-willed nature at first, she realized she had fun playing with Bronwyn. When Finn was able to escape from his duties as an apprentice smith, Callie would tempt him into playing piquet and draughts, though he always beat her at both. At the end of the month when they presented Callie with a piece of onyx to take home to Yalistar as protection against the White Woman, Callie realized she had made new friends. The yearly visits to Mandilin never seemed so bad after that, even though she hated the crowds attracted by the Drawbridge Festival. Upon returning to Yalistar, Callie would spend several days sequestered in the back of her mother’s apothecary adjusting to the quiet without her friends. She would lose herself in the stillness grinding herbs and making tisanes, and occasionally experimenting with a decoction of her own. Though she had caused a few small accidents by overheating glass phials or mixing healing herbs with poisonous ones, no one expected the explosion. In addition to almost killing Callie, part of the root of the divine tree beneath which the shop was built was scorched and the outcry from the community was immediate. The Tommard name was blackened, and Callie was exiled from the city. She has yet to tell any of her friends what she did, and why she had to move to Mandilin for good.Through Bronwynn and Finnegan, Callie met Marin Caen. The group was together in Mandilin during the Emerald Lottery when all four of their names were drawn from the crystal vessel. Callie suspects her name bring drawn was a convenient way for her to disappear so she will be unable to cause more destruction, but has no real proof that the lottery was rigged."9/18/2017 16:41:54,Ezen Awoshan,Human,Wizard,"Ezen is an old man now, but he's been studying magic since he was 17 years old.He was raised by loving parents and grew up well. They we're not poor, but they we're not wealthy either. Ezen had a fair life, if not a bit cold for some.Ezen grew up in the town of Holden in The Ever Reaching Rise, an area of very tall, snowy, and secluded, mountains in the north. His family had moved there before he was born seeking a close-knit community away from the bustle and trouble of the rest of the world. Ezen and his family found a home there. Ezen, and he grew up, began to take interest in Rummiara, the town Magic College.The magic fascinated him, especially how the basic elements of the earth could be manipulated and summoned at will. After his regular schooling, he enrolled at Rummiara as soon as he could.He is an old man now. He's 73 and studied magic for 56 years, and his taking a delicious nap. Suddenly, interrupting his sleep, a dull pinging rings in his head signifying someone has dropped a letter through his mail slot.It's a rare event, and Ezen is both curious and cautious. He lives alone near the top of the mountain now, not many know his address, and no one has ever delivered mail. He runs down the 161 stairs of his perfectly round mage tower to pick up the letter.It reads: ""Ezen, I remember when you were so excited for magic and i hope you haven't dulled in your curiosity in your old age as some of my colleagues have. If you're up for some adventure, we at the college think we've located an object you may be very interested in. The Frozen Star. We don't know much expect that it's an object capable of near limitless power in the area of Evocation, and especially cold and ice. We at the college can't pursue it, either because we're either teaching students or are too lazy! If you find it, come drop by and show us.""The letter was signed, ""Fargrim"". Fargrim was the most scholarly dwarf Ezen had ever met, and was his Evocation professor at the college. Fargrim was like Ezen's second father. He'd be about 250 now. The letter also contained a map with a circle around the area they believed The Star was.Overjoyed at this information, Ezen let out an excited YA-HOO. He's been looking for a reason to get out and quest, test out all his research, and an artifact of cold? what could be better?He grabbed as much adventuring supplies as he could stuff in his backpack along with his leather-bound spellbook that had a quite ornate snowflake on the front.Then donned his hat hung on a hook by the door, blew out all his candles, grabbed his staff, tipped his hat to the tower, and limped out the door."9/17/2017 18:39:32,Alicia Maria de Luna,human,Wizard,"Alicia comes from a wealthy family of minor nobles. She took naturally to wizardry, but her extraplanar interests confounded her tutors. So, she began to consort not (particularly) with dark powers, but with strange powers - many who speak dead tongues or live deep beneath the sea. Her behavior as of late has led to a certain amount of estrangement from her family. Her parents believe that Alicia's experimentations are having an adverse affect on her health and sanity, and have curtly refused to fund them any further. The relationship between Alicia and her parents is further complicated by the fact that Alicia’s elder sister, Esme Merideth de Luna, has recently pledged herself to serve the church of Cyndor as a paladin, renouncing her claim to the title of Contessa...which will now, unexpectedly, fall to Alicia.Alicia is undaunted. She considers herself bohemian, and cares little for any law but her own - including the natural laws of the prime material plane. She respects that others maintain and act upon their own beliefs, however, and does not court conflict with them - to each their own. She has an extensive correspondence with experts in a variety of fields, from diverse backgrounds with wide-ranging philosophical views. With them she is known (often under a pseudonym) as an expert in history, spellcraft, and the arcane - and most especially, of the planes. She quotes often from her readings, and has published a small number of well-regarded monographs, one of which has been censored by three churches - a fact of which she is quietly proud.Alicia is surprisingly well kempt for someone so distracted from the mundane, an appearance she maintains with cantrips out of habit. She has light brown skin that seems paler than it ought to, and fine features. Though petite, her breeding and training have gifted her with what actors call “presence”. She is polite and generally without malice, though ruthless under provocation.As a result of the meditations that allow her to command shadows of the denizens of alien planes, she has somewhat rearranged the furniture in her head, and her affect is subtly askew. (To give one small example, she has not yawned in over eleven years.) She tends to unnerve people, a fact which she is aware of - and unashamed of! - though she will make an effort to compensate for it if circumstances demand it. She is a talented liar, but only for advantage - she does not lie reflexively, or to toy with others. Her sense of humor is...unique.Her right eye is bright blue with an unusually small pupil; the left is charcoal grey; dark enough that it’s often difficult to tell where the pupil begins. (This is a physical consequence of her budding transcendence).When she wants to, she can become the nightmare image of the craftily and capriciously mad gentry. Lately that also seems to happen when she is short on sleep or abstracted."9/18/2017 5:48:58,Jackson Kickass,Human,Monk,"I tell many stories of my origin, but none are true. I can't risk letting anyone know how I became what I am today. That information is just... too dangerous for ordinary men.So anyway, it began when I was a young man, ready to take on the world with nothing more than my bare fists and the clothes on my back. I was a high-flying and cocky rookie of the Domestic Protection Unit. We weren't much more than glorified exterminators, but damn near everyone in town knew our names. Every once in a while, we'd get something fun to do; fight some goblins, kill some raiders. This was one of those times. We were dispatched in the dead of night, with a map that lead to a supposed bandit outpost that was just a bit too close for comfort. We were prepared to kick more ass than a Taiwanese donkey trainer, but when we got there we were ambushed. They had hidden their numbers, and planned to swarm us. My entire group was decimated. I saw my best friend die in front of my very eyes. At that very moment, just as I charged in with my fist held high, something happened. Suddenly, I was struck by lightning, bitten by a radioactive rattlesnake, bombarded with gamma rays, and set on fire. Also my parents died.I blacked out harder than a drunken dwarf. When I woke up, I was standing on the top of a mountain. I was surrounded by the souls of dozens of kung-fu masters. They told me I was the spirit-descendant of the greatest martial artist of all time, and I was destined to carry on his incredible legacy. They used their ki to unlock a power inside me, and suddenly... I was a kung-fu master.They sent me back to the material world, and I woke up to find a scene so horrible it would make a succubus blush. The raiders had killed everyone. Filled with righteous fury, I charged into battle, and fought for hours. They were clearly no match for my incredible powers, but they were tenacious. After dispatching the rabble, I confronted the leader. We fought hand-to-hand, mano-a-mano. Of course, I was victorious. Before he died however, he knocked over a candle and it set fire to a nearby lamp-shade. Fire engulfed the building. I know that I ran, but I barely remember what happened. Eventually, I collapsed from exhaustion.I woke up in the courtyard, the warlord and his men were gone and I was left in the rubble.Realizing the immense responsibility that had been placed on my shoulders, I ventured out into the world, determined to fulfill my destiny. But I knew if this was to be accomplished, I would have to change my entire life. I took a new name, and promised to tell only the closest of souls my true origin. When I ran through the gates of the encampment, there was no more Lawrence Wolfgang.There was only Jackson Kickass."9/18/2017 16:05:57,Joannes Zonaras,Human,Warlock,"  I was once a professor at a university in Proliet, with my own office and my own private collection of books, teaching the next generation of geniuses, philosophers, and researchers that were bound to come out of this school. I was fairly young to be teaching, especially at a Proliet university, but that was my passion, I never went in depth into a particular study. I had a wife at home, Alahna, whom I had only recently married, and she, of course, was more brains than beauty. But that is what made her perfect: a brain to challenge and compliment my own. It was the perfect life for me..... Was.    One day, as I arrived home after a late lecture, I saw the door to my - our - house broken inward. Fearing the worst, I ran inside. All of the valuables in the house were gone. Okay. A robbery. A simple thief. A thief is there for the money, not blood, so no one was hurt, right? My Alahna must not have been home, otherwise they wouldn't have went through with it, right? I knew I was just trying to come up with a logical explanation for an unlikely outcome. As I knelt there, above who was once one the two most important things in my life, I came to a shocking realization....Knowledge.... knowledge doesn't matter. Knowledge doesn't give power. I could guarantee that Alahna was smarter than at least half of my fellow professors. What did that get her? Nothing. It didn't protect her or give her the ability to protect herself. What use was there in knowledge when this world was dictated by violence and strength? And if there was no use for knowledge, what use was there for me?    Coming to a decision that would not, could not, be changed, I left for my office at the university. As I entered, I closed the door behind me. I had intended to end myself alongside the physical representation of the last rock in my life, my rare book collection. Looking at the tomes now, I was disgusted. I strode towards them, destructive intent that I would have thought impossible for me earlier that day was on my mind. Reaching for the shelf, my hand grasped a delicate tome.....     And I was in a different place. Looking forward, I saw my hand clasping the same book I had grabbed on my shelf. But this wasn't my shelf. I looked side to side, and saw a seemingly endless aisle stretching on either side, lined with rows upon rows of books. These shelves looked ancient, yet in pristine condition, at the same time. A voice spoke into my mind. Since that day, that has been the only time I heard that voice, and yet I cannot recall what it said. Despite this, I know what I learned. Knowledge was power. And that meant this place was power, as it was knowledge incarnate. Now I work to preserve and expand that power, if not for my own sake, then for Alahna's."9/18/2017 9:25:14,Quillion Merchant,Human,Warlock,"BackgroundQuill is a 23-year-old human merchant and recent warlock. His great grandfather made a pact with a demon pledging a son in exchange for his house having one hundred years of prosperity.  He was born with a brand on his hand and his birth was met with a volcanic explosion destroying his house’s lands. Further disturbing maladies and coincidences in his family have left him the last scion of a once proud house.Distant relatives (3rd cousins) of the house Goldthorn took him in after his parents died.  They trained him in their family business as weapons merchants.  Owing to his significant skills of persuasion he was quickly able to prove his capability to pursue lucrative contracts with the guild and his adoptive family's support.  Despite his successes the leadership of the guild keep a wary eye on him due to his severe temper, especially after the incident where he nearly strangled to death a small town mayor who tried to renege on a deal with his bare hands.  His temper has always been quick but as he has gotten older he’s begun to feel power emanating from his brand.  It seems to whisper to him in his moments of passion.After a few years of working on others behalf the perfect opportunity arose.  It was a gamble taking that large of a loan from the Goldthorns against everything he owned, but the temptation to tackle a lucrative contract on his own was too promising of an opportunity to pass up. He put together a caravan including a young half orc named Biter as a caravan guard.  After successfully delivering the weapons, he and his caravan celebrated that evening by drinking Biter’s potent ""experiments"" at the local tavern.  In the pre dawn morning he awoke with a powerful hangover and the previous night a blur. Confused he should have awoken to a hot bath and payment awaiting at the town’s bursar.   Instead he awoke to the ruins of a smoldering tavern. It took all of his presence of mind to grab Biter (his only other surviving caravanner), and take them on his cart out of the village as quick as the mule would go.  Soon the villagers would be looking for the cause of destruction with pitchforks (or worse considering the recent delivery of weapons).  With a worrying glance at his brand as the smoke from the inn fades in the distance he reflects on his change of fortune.  He contemplates a new path, at least until he can figure out what happened that night and how to repair all the things that have gone wrong and the bridges he’s burnt.Since fleeing the town he has discovered new powers that he has begun practicing with.  Additionally he has been surprised and touched that Biter has stayed with him through this trying time.  What do you do when you when you want to turn over a new leaf in life?  You head home!  Upon reaching Neverwinter the town where he was born, he found work with a dwarf named Gundren Rockseeker.  He will join an escort to protect a caravan en route to Philandren.  Some day he will figure out what is this dark power in him is, he will repair relations with the Goldthorns, and he will restore his house from the ruins of Corlinn Hill.  Until then he will survive."9/18/2017 14:31:01,Tristram Arverus,Human,Wizard,"Tristram was born in Katagia, the first and only son of Starn and Vinvella Arverus. Like many citizens of the “Last Bastion of Atlantis,” Tristram is of Atlantean blood, and has always lived like one, born with a silver spoon in his mouth. The wealth of a three-generation-long mercantile empire of the Arverus family combined with Vinvella’s youth and wits (being that she is twenty years younger than her aging husband), led Tristram to have a pampered, perhaps even spoiled, upbringing.As the child of such doting parents, Tristram was provided an education on a small but sizable fortune. Starn and Vinvella wanted nothing but the best for their son and hired only the best tutors to cultivate their son’s growing mind. Tristram excelled in the subjects that interested him: history, medicine, religion, and most importantly, magic. It wasn’t long before Starn and Vinvella realized they would need to find a teacher of more occult leanings.By chance, while gambling at the Katagian pits, Starn met a surly, but well-spoken man named Graeme, a self-proclaimed “scientist” who conducted necromantic experiments on the unwanted corpses of pit fighters who perished in the arena. Although Graeme was never the mentoring type (unsurprising considering how irritable and antisocial he was most of the time) he was in need of an assistant. Starn’s goodwill and trusting character got the better of him, and at the age of fifteen, Tristram began to study science and magic under Graeme as his apprentice.Graeme and Tristram’s relationship was rocky at the best of times. While Graeme acknowledged Tristram’s intellect in private, he never professed such thoughts aloud and instead often patronized Tristram to the point of bitter arguments. Despite their differences, Tristram always came back the next day and Graeme continued to tutor him for the next six years. However, as Tristram grew older and began to more adamantly challenge Graeme’s theories, the old wizard pushed back harder and their already unstable relationship fell apart. For a few years, Tristram studied on his own during the twilight hours, while working for the family business during a more reasonable time of day. Mind you, it wasn’t genuine interest that brought Tristram to the family business, but the prospect of freedom, coin, and power. You see, over the years Tristram had developed a want for importance, lusting for fame and glory, but not from simple merchantry or with Graeme’s name attached. Tristram wanted real power, the power of conquest, the power over life and death, to seek forgotten relics, forbidden knowledge and making coin all along the way. Tristram had a plan: escort a merchant galley along the coasts of Thule, all the way to Quodeth and make off with the merchandise, the gold, all of it, leave his parents, his teacher, all of Katagia behind him and make a name for himself, a name to be respected, perhaps even feared. Unfortunately, his plan never quite came to fruition, as the merchant galley was sacked by pirates outside Marg and he was left with nothing but the gold on him as he washed up on the shores of Thule.Marooned, Tristram trekked through the wilderness and found himself, by chance in Quodeth, ragged, hungry, and injured, but demoralized? Oh, no. His tenacity was fueled on pure spite, and desire for vengeance against the pirates that took the gold that was his to steal."9/18/2017 8:03:34,Arthos,Human,Warrior,"At 6 feet tall and 158 pounds, Arthos is tall and skinny. He has fair skin and light, almost white hair. His origins are a mystery. He was found as a baby by the Wizards of the Green Eye in the doorway of their tower one morning. Hoping that this would bring them fortune, or possibly that it was a test of the Gods, they decided to bring him up and teach him the ways of magic. Sadly this was an almost complete failure as he demonstrated absolutely no talent whatsoever. However, he retains a fascination for all things magical and will invariably opt to get hold of magical seeming things if possible. Misguidedly he believes that is merely practice that he lacks rather than native intelligence. He only speaks Common but knows lots of magical words, without necessarily understanding their significance.The Wizards of the Green Eye retain a great fondness for him (even though they make fun of him behind his back), and he a loyalty to them for their support. In part this comes from the services he has done for them over the years, using his strength and nimbleness for things like cleaning gargoyle poo out of the gutters  (the bursar told him that it was a valuable ingredient for spells). In spite of his attempts to become a magician coming to nothing, he nevertheless has the soul of an adventurer. His facility for combat first came to light when a failed experiment created a swarm of giant bees which began to menace the residents of the tower. He rescued one wizard, out of spells, by hurling ornamental stones from the rockery with great accuracy at the bess, smashing them to pulp. He subsequently extracted an intact stinger from one of the insects, prizing it for its lustrous qualities. However he began to annoy the wizards owing to his tendency to slaughter any flying creatures – friendly or otherwise - that he came across, though they admired his skill with missiles.His reputation was sealed when the Wizard's Tower was attacked by a force of brigands who used a spell that put all magic using creatures inside the building to sleep. Arthos was, of course, unaffected, and leapt to defend the tower from being pillaged. He took out several bandits with hurled crockery filled with gargoyle poo before being cornered by the leader. In desperation he pulled out his stinger and fenced with it, scratching the man's unprotected wrist. To his surprise the bandit collapsed, swelled up and died. The other bandits ran for their lives. Arthos is convinced either that the stinger is magical or that he somehow performed a spell to save his friends, in spite of no divination showing any evidence of either. The locals nicknamed him “Stinger” in honour of this  feat (a definite step up from Bonehead), something he is quite proud of.Recognising his talents and the need to get rid of someone with a tendency to assassinate homunculi, familiars and butterflies, the Wizards suggested that he had the potential to be a “Warrior Mage”. This naturally involved him going somewhere else to learn the Warrior part. After some initial lessons at the local fighting school he has set off to find his fortune, vowing to return when he has mastered both magic and combat so that the wizards will be truly proud of him."9/18/2017 12:55:49,Viktor Katz,Human,Cleric,"Viktor Katz was born on a farm near a village in Krynn. A small village, surrounded by hilly woods on one side and farm lands on the other.As he came into the world, he was possessed by a newly spawned demon. The demon would randomly take control of his body and commit mischief, causing Viktor’s family a lot of grief. Putting fragile objects close to edges, putting round objects in walkways to cause trips, etc. At first Viktor, being the innocent child he is, was amused by the mischief. However, as the years progressed the mischief turned more gruesome. Harming small animals, dissecting the barn cats, etc.When Viktor was 10, the demon caused his 4 year old brother Alexander to drown in the river near the farm. Viktor, not knowing being possessed is not normal, tells his parents he did it. His parents just think he says it out of survivor guilt.At the age of 12 the demon inside Viktor escalates to murdering a couple of the villagers, and does so undetected. Except Viktor, who witnessed every murder.On his 13th birthday, the demon decides to kill his family. The demon sneaks up on Viktor’s parents as they sleep and knocks them out with a club. The demon then has Viktor tying up both of them, before overpowering his little sister Anna and tying her up as well. Then, once Viktor’s father is awake, the demon uses Viktor to kill his sister and mother while his father is helpless. As the demon controlled Viktor finally cuts his father’s throat, a neighbor happened to be dropping by and hears the screaming from outside. The demon takes the backseat again, and watches as Viktor collapses in horror and grief. The neighbor returns with a posse he rallied, and they lock him away. As they discuss what to do with him, a traveling cleric of Mishakal called Lukas hears of the horrible murders, and comes to investigate. The town elders allow Lukas to examine Viktor, while they watch. The demon responds fiercely to the cleric’s holy powers and, with Viktor being restrained, finally leaves the boy’s body to battle the cleric in its true form. The cleric manages to vanquish the demon after a hard fought battle.The town elders, having witnessed the battle, set the boy free, but are not willing to take him in. Lukas takes him with him to the main temple of Mishakal, where Viktor is raised by the acolytes of the temple, who also train him over the years to be a cleric, as Viktor has made it his mission in life to prevent what happened to him from happening to anyone else.At the age of 18, having become an actual cleric with Mishakal’s blessing, he starts traveling the world, at first along with Lukas, and after a couple of years decides to set out on his own.After multiple decades of travel, in his 59th year, Mishakal’s calling leads him to travel into the mists that lead to Barovia. Unbeknownst to him Mishakal had sent Lukas to Barovia many years before, where he had been driven insane by Strahd. Mishakal sent Viktor to rescue Lukas, and to aid him in what might be a lengthy mission, she slows his aging down to a mere trickle. As always, his goddess leads him to places, but that is the extent of the interaction. He himself has to figure out what needs doing."9/18/2017 13:05:28,Rayleigh Ormound,Human,Warlock/Fighter,"Denizens of the Kymal Badlands are no strangers to dark deals and backstabbing.  The political landscape of the region is tumultuous at best and open war at worst.  The warlords who call themselves the Barons of the land are in a constant struggle against one another to grab any small amount of power they can.  Rayleigh Oromund spent his formative years witness to countless treacherous pacts.  He was fortunate enough to be born into the relative wealth of a “royal” family in the Kymal Badlands.  His uncle is the greedy and bloodthirsty Baron Morgan.  His mother and father, loyal servants to Morgan, were granted a lavish lifestyle and Rayleigh had a privileged upbringing.  He was trained to fight from an early age and groomed for command of part of Morgan’s army.  Rayleigh takes great pride in his skill as duelist, even if he isn’t keen on fighting fair.  He will go to any length to defeat an enemy, honor is meaningless to him.  After all, in the Kymal Badlands honor and chivalry will leave you on the ground with a knife in your back.  Rayleigh was seemingly set to live in relative ease compared to the majority of residents of Kymal.  Perhaps that’s why he caught the ire of Baron Morgan.  In his paranoia, the Baron saw Rayleigh as a treat to his rule.  He invited Rayleigh on a hunting trip, during which he was set upon by the Baron and his men who tortured him, lashed him to a tree, and left him for dead, telling his family he had died in an hunting accident. For 4 days and nights he suffered.  Delusional from hunger and dehydration he slipped in and out of consciousness and lost all sense of time.  In what felt like his dying moments, in a last ditch effort for survival, he called out for aid from anyone who was listening. Recalling books he had read about powerful extraplanar entities, he begged for a chance at life, whatever the cost be.  An obscure and ominous entity reached out to him.  It offered him power and a chance at revenge.  It offered a deal: Become a soldier in it’s army, a piece in it’s plan, and in return have a chance at revenge.  Rayleigh accepted.  He awoke the next day invigorated, unbound, and with a mysterious pendant around his neck.  Rayleigh traveled south towards the wall, instructed by his patron to hone his powers before confronting his family.  Rayleigh had 2 impossible tasks ahead of him.  Crossing the wall into Acelia was nigh impossible, and once across he would have to hide his identity, lest he be deported or killed on the spot.   He was fortunate enough to happen upon a group of freelancers, the dwarf Ukrag “Krag” Duli and his party from. Rayleigh begged for help and gave a show of his newly acquired powers.  Ukrag helped Rayleigh recover and inducted into his group where Rayleigh worked for free as repayment doing various odd jobs of questionable morality.Krag and Rayleigh eventually went their separate ways.  It’s been more than a year since they last spoke and Rayleigh has been wandering around as a sellsword doing various odd jobs.Rayleigh has received no guidance from his patron since he was ordered to hone his skills.  He is hiding his background and offering his services as a mercenary.  He loves the work he does even if he is relatively poor and under-equipped at the moment."9/18/2017 12:16:57,Bobert Dobbs,Human,Wizard,"Bobert Dobbs is a neutral human illusionist. He's out to find and loot an ancient temple for artifacts. He also occasionally makes references to being a Duke of Waterdeep, and has a great fake signet ring to go with his charlatan backstory. In reality he's got a wife and three daughters who live next to his mentor's mage tower. His recent jail time was for running a ball and cups scam on a town guardsman.  While technically it was an illusion discovered it was really subconsciously self-inflicted so he could get some breathing space away from Connie and the girls. You would think a learned wizard with an unnaturally high IQ and eidetic memory would remember to take the garbage out at night, but Connie always seems to be reminding him to do chores and constantly reminds him of his other failings as a member of a functioning household. Bobert met his wife while they were running scams together in the city and she's quite a talented rogue herself.   Once the kids arrived, Connie got sensible, Grew Up and Became Responsible.   Bobert is a bit baffled by the change.   Like, he gets the concept of Responsibility and knows why it's good to have.  He has nothing but respect for the responsible people (when he isn't scamming them).  But, when the boots hit the trail it's just not something that he applies to his everyday life.   His usual coping mechanism when faced with things he doesn't want to deal with is to reduce it down to immediate comforts like ""Why is there no good wine on this Demiplane of Evil?"" or ""Instead of talking to these spooky druids why don't we just fireball them and be back at the inn by sunset?""  He's realized illusions are one of the best ways to avoid thinking/dealing with the truly awful things that happen in the world.  That said, Bobert adores his wife as much as anyone (other than himself) in the world.   Leaving home on a moment's notice to find and loot a temple wasn't really a family decision.  The intensely angry response when he got home was answered with a ""Sorry honey, trapped on a Demiplane of Evil!  No way to get a message back!  Hey look at this amazing staff and chest of gold!""  Although he does drive Connie crazy she realizes he's still the wild and fun guy she fell in love with.  She just expected him to, you know, GROW UP eventually.   She's still waiting.Bobert's daughters LOVE their dad.  With his illusions he is the BEST quasi-adult playmate EVER and stuffed monster tea parties with Dad are AWESOME. He's a 'kids should be free to be kids' type in his head but it actually turns out more as an 'I don't set healthy boundaries with children and really most things they break can be fixed with a mending cantrip so why worry' absentee parent. He has a soft spot for kids but after saving them he's blind to any supervisory needs and just kind of assumes they more or less take care of themselves (kind of like cats).           Once he learns the secrets of Ultimate Wisdom and gains Artifacts of Awesome Power his plan is to make the entire family thing actually work for a change and give them all a good life. Unfortunately a few steps in The Plan For Family Success are a bit hazy and his general plan is to simply throw an excessive amount of money and/or magic at things until they're fixed.  It's also more than likely he'll just move on to some other messed up scheme and end up back where they started.    Anyway, after looting that temple and getting rich, maybe he'll get Connie a maid and this whole 'you never take out the trash Bob' thing will blow over."9/18/2017 12:19:31,"""Shay"" Beshaba Milliner",Human,Ranger,"Shay was born to the Milliners in Harstvale. Her father was a milliner by profession, but Harstvale was not a place that ever seemed in particular need for fancy hats. Her father had never really fit in at Harstvale and he'd always wanted to leave and take his hat-making skills to one of the big cities, but he and her mother, the butcher's daughter, had accidentally conceived Shay when they were fooling around for the first time. When her mother was discovered to be pregnant, her father was forced into a spearpoint wedding that would tie him down to Harstvale forever. Being tied down was particularly difficult because her father never really liked women in that way, but people like him didn't fit in in Harstvale, so he had tried to make things work that one time with her mother, and he was a shocked as she was to find out that she was pregnant.Oddly she doesn't really bear much of the features of either her father or her mother. The person that bears the most resemblance to her is the town drunk, a half-elf with green eyes and auburn hair that had been an archer in the wars against Tiamat and had come to the town with nightmares and a habit for drinking. Her mother says that the resemblance with this half-elf is pure coincidence.Her mother named her Beshada, after the goddess of ill fortune. There might be some truth to her name; her mother was watching her one day near the edge of the forest when a group of Goblins came out of the forest and abducted her mother and left her screaming alone for help near the trees. Since then, she has been raised only by her father, who calls her Shay.She was always mischievous and the town of Harstvale all took an interest in trying to raise her, and it was when she was young that she first took up archery. The town drunk, Delaan, gave her a bow on her 6th birthday, the year after her mother disappeared. He has always claimed that he was too drunk to remember buying it for her, but Shay thought it looked curiously like it had been hand-made in the style of Delaan's own bow. It was almost as if Shay had some elven blood in herself, since she took to archery so naturally. She had soon surpassed the abilities of all the grown men in town except for Delaan who would always stand by and watch her shoot in competitions and the like, and it seemed to be the only time when he wasn't laying about drunk.Like her father, Shay also loves to make hats, and she creates them in a variety of colors. For herself, she likes to wear a green hat with a red feather in the hat, but she's frequently putting something together in her spare time.Once she was older, her village was besieged by a band of Goblin that had decided to work together for some ridiculous reason. No one could really fight them, and the whole town was destined to die, until Beshaba challenged their bugbear leader to a fight. He came out ready to crush her, but she pulled out a sling and a stone and hit him right in the eye, and he fell down dead.Shortly after this, her father sat her down and explained that he couldn't stand to see her get stuck in Harstvale just like he did. It was difficult, but he told her how much he admired her, and that it was her responsibility to get out and be his eyes to see the world. He taught her too that it was her duty to use her talents to help those that cannot help themselves and that change only happens when people stand up and fight for it. So she left, determined to make the world a better place."9/18/2017 17:39:03,Shula Shaga,Human,Eldritch Knight,"Shula Shaga was Riverbridge born and Riverbridge bred. Although her family was never particularly wealthy, they always had enough to get by, and going hungry was a rarity, typically happening only during the occasional economic downturn. At 14, when she was old enough, she began her apprenticeship to Glimrock Axenhammer, one of the guild's finest blacksmiths, and though she was neither the fastest learner, nor the most skilled, she was certainly the most persistent, and by far the slowest to give up in the face of frustration and failure.A few months after her apprenticeship finished at age 20, however, a mercantile caravan with which she was traveling found itself ambushed near an entrance to the Underdark by what appeared to be some manner of fish-men. A blow to the head knocked her senseless, and before long she was bound, paralyzed by some manner of poisoned crossbow bolt that was now sticking out of her left shoulder, and being dragged toward the entrance.At some point, her consciousness left her; when she awakened, she found herself right back where she had been captured, slumped unceremoniously over one of the caravan's dead, slightly-rotted horses alongside the corpses of the caravan's guards, although not all of them. Despite having no idea what had happened during that time, she also discovered that she somehow knew roughly how long she had been gone — nearly a week. Additionally, however, she found that she had absolutely no curiosity whatsoever about how she came by that information, nor about what had happened during that time; and nor did she find her lack of curiosity at all strange.So, barring any feeling that anything was amiss, aside from the caravan attack itself, she simply made her way back to town by way of hitching a ride with a passing carriage; and, after some medical attention for her shoulder wound — sadly too late to avoid a prominent, and always slightly sore, scar — she returned to her life of forging weapons and armor for the city guard, the local militia, and anyone else with coin, and occasionally volunteering with said militia to help take out minor threats outside town, be they bandits or bears.And thus did it continue for a number of years. But ever-present in Shula's mind, whispering at both her conscious and unconscious, was a deep and abiding desire to do *something's* bidding — and not just any something, but that of an Ulitharid, a tentacled flayer of the mind from the darkest parts of the underground; and moreover, that of the Elder Brain with which leads and directs the colony. Alongside that desire came a second one: The desire to keep that knowledge, the information about her servitude, to herself.Unknown to both Shula *and* the Elder Brain, however, was that this Ulitharid, the very same being that had led the process of enthralling her in the first place, was no ordinary one of its kind (if any of them could indeed be called ordinary at all), but one who had secretly turned to the arts arcane to augment its own natural abilities — a being known among the Illithid as an Alhoon, seen as a deviant to be purged once discovered, for Alhoons worked not for the continued survival and betterment of the colony and the Elder Brain, but for their own self-interest, with many striving toward lichdom. And indeed, unknown to the Elder Brain, its own control over Shula was entirely a sham, with the Alhoon simply relaying the same commands when given in order to maintain the Brain's illusion of control.These desires and orders conflicted frequently with her innate desire for independence and honesty, and the mental anguish produced by the clash was extreme, particularly during the times when the Alhoon compelled her against her will to perform actions she found distasteful or even abhorrent: Revealing information about the goings-on in the city, or spying on certain important individuals, or even the removal of others. To what end, she did not know, and with the control exerted by the Alhoon, she had not even the *ability* to desire to speculate.But she did have the ability, very much so, to be afraid."9/18/2017 16:21:37,Augustanna Fortune,Human,Rogue,"Long ago, when her name was Brynd, she lived in the distant border land of Odrith, among the vineyards tended by her father. Her mother was a known adventuress, the town witch-doctor, and a local hero of no small repute.  All this was fine and normal for a country girl.  The land even enjoyed peaceable co-existence with the nearby goblins of the Yk_d, but there were so many of them. Then came the day when the hobgoblins and orcs came down from the mountains and whipped the Yk_d into a frenzy.  The people of Odrith rallied around their heroes, and in mortal combat withstood the onslaught of the horde at tragic cost.  Her mother fell in battle, and despite all help and good intention, her father was ruined afterward.  The vineyard failed and there was not enough food for either of them, until the Winter Carnival came to town.  The master of ceremonies expressed an interest in her singing and dancing talents, so her father let them take her.  But when he later realized he had sold his daughter to the circus for food, he fell into darkness and despair.The child travelled with the Winter Carnival for months and years. Never one for book-learning, she quickly enough caught on to the tricks of the carnies, the acrobatics of the tumblers, and the Sword Dance of the Bessarabian Cossacks. (Though the clowns really creeped her out.)  When she came of age, she made her debut as “Augustanna Fortune” and delighted audiences around the countryside with her dazzling displays.  In due time, the Winter Carnival arrived in the Imperial City of Rochaven, and performed for the Garnok Emperor himself.  Augustanna caught the eye of the Emperor, and he took her in among his court, where she quickly became recognized as a favorite of the Emperor.  This led to all kinds of unwanted attention from obsequious courtiers, and especially drew the ire of the evil Barnaby, the court jester, who was always plotting against the throne. Now, the Emperor was a good patron to Augustanna, and a noble steward of the Empire.  He was, though, not bold and visionary like his predecessor, nor brash and ruthless like those who would follow him.  He was an old warrior, just keeping the throne warm between ages of Imperial glory.  Barnaby never saw Augustanna as more than the Emperor’s tart of the moment, until she foiled his plots to bring about the Emperor’s downfall.  Though Barnaby’s treachery was not fully revealed, the Emperor saw that it was no longer safe for Augustanna in the Imperial court. He released her from his service, but gave her the protection of his finest Assassin of the Imperial Guard, Colonel Nors Spikes and his henchmen (Rolf and Pauly).She made her own way in the city of Rochaven, avoiding the truly abhorrent, but ultimately falling in with a vile, fat tiefling named Tobin Chort for a manager.  With help from Col. Spikes, she learned the ways of the street, rising above Chort’s machinations to become quite the celebrity in town.  Against better judgement, she was still a frequent guest at the Imperial palace, until the night the Emperor died.  (It should be noted that he passed peacefully, in his sleep, through no obvious fault of hers.)  It all happened so fast … Augustanna was ushered out of the palace that night by Col. Spikes to safety, but Barnaby made sure to raise implications that she was involved in the murder plot when the new emperor started an investigation.She finally had to leave the city.  Col. Spikes had arranged for her passage on board the clipper “Marathon”, captained by Laras Trent.  They learned that Rolf had been killed.  Col. Spikes then ordered Pauly to escort her through the murky back streets of Rochaven to the harbor, but they were beset by the jester’s goons.  She saw Pauly die before they could reach the rendez-vous point.  On her own, Augustanna lurked on the docks while the watchmen of the Imperial Guard confronted Captain Trent.  Yes, he was supposed to carry a girl out of the city, but she had never shown up. They searched the ship and found nothing; only after the guards departed did she sneak aboard and disappear onto the midnight seas."9/18/2017 13:54:54,Markus Drakarhis IV,Human,Fighter/Cleric,"The fourth son of a military commander, Markus grew up idolizing his father and the military. Dreaming of becoming a soldier like his father, Markus did his best to learn as much as possible from his father in the short time that he knew him. When he was 9, the elder Drakarhis was slain by an orc during a night time raid on their camp while defending the border from potential threat. Haunted by the death of his father and racked with guilt at his inability to do anything to save him, Markus IV sunk into depression. Despite his age, Markus blamed himself for his father's death, believing that if only he were old enough to join the military then he would have been able to save his father. After years of private training and education, 14-year-old Markus enrolled in the military academy with the aim at being the soldier that he knew he could be, the one that would make his father proud.Shortly after enrollment, it became obvious to those around him that he was gifted. His peers became jealous while Markus developed a sense of superiority over them. While he was not outwardly callous in his treatment of his peers, he developed a sense of arrogance towards them that his teachers picked up on almost immediately. In order to curb this, the head of the academy immediately withdrew Markus from his martial training and placed him in the care of the army clerics of Vartiel - hoping that it would prevent the young Markus from further developing his arrogance, while teaching him the structure that he sorely needed.In the beginning, Markus rebelled against the teachings of Vartiel, viewing them as overly regimented and pointless in his ultimate goal in becoming a soldier. It was not until he met Kildrak Ungar, a battle-priest of Valtiel, did he become aware of just how connected the teachings of his God and the tenets of the military were. With renewed vigor, Markus set out become not only the best soldier in the military, but a battle-priest beyond compare.Upon graduation, which coincided with his 21st birthday, Markus had made a name for himself that would have undoubtedly made his father happy. The arrogance banished and his training over, Markus was assigned to a small border town that had come under attack several times by bands of orcs and the occasional group of bandits. All of his dreams were finally coming true and he relished the opportunity to further make a name for himself and rise in the ranks of the military. Unbeknownst to Markus, however, his time in the military would be a short one.The first night after his arrival, the town came under attack by a large band of orcs. They burned, killed, and pillaged anything in sight and the small regiment was no match for them. Knowing this must be what his father had seen before drawing his last breath, Markus was paralyzed with fear and guilt, unable to assist in the defense despite having every desire to do so. The town was almost completely destroyed and most of his regiment, his friends and new family, were murdered. The few survivors blamed Markus and his inaction for the slaughter and he was immediately discharged with great shame.Unable to face his family back home, Markus wandered the wilds on his own, trying to seek solace in whatever he could find. He blamed himself, he blamed the orcs, but mostly he blamed Vartiel for seemingly abandoning him. Turning his back on his faith, Markus attempted several times to take his own life as the depression of his youth resurfaced. Unsuccessful, he continued to wander from town-to-town doing odd jobs when he could and sleeping in stables when he could not.This continued for some years until a fateful encounter with a priest of Stagg. Who, after some time in his company, managed to convince Markus that his past was nothing to be ashamed of and that all was not lost. At 27, he converted to the worship of Stagg, believing that the warrior God enabled him to use his skills as a battle-priest while avoiding the rigid tenets of Vartiel. Deciding that while his military life was a failure, his life did not need to be and his name did not have to remain sullied. And so, with renewed vigor, he would reinvent himself as a mercenary and guardian for the poor, downtrodden and helpless. Protecting them from the evils that would do them harm... with a hammer and a prayer."9/18/2017 4:30:50,Tess Evenwood,Human,Healer,"	Tess Evenwood is a good person at heart, though gives the first impression of an inconsiderate jerk. She cares about helping people, she just has none of the social skills to show it. She speaks very directly, without regard for common courtesy, has a tendency to ignore people when she's doing something important, and is often oblivious to her surroundings and the people in them. All that aside, Tess has expert focus when plying her trade. 	Tess grew up in the enormous metropolis of Waterdeep, City of Splendors, exposing her to all sorts of people and faiths. And while her parents held very free-thinking views on the subject of the gods, they still insisted she find and devote herself to one above all others. Uncertain, she often wandered the temple districts to eavesdrop on services or clerics discussing their faiths. All these gods seemed so far above common men and women, she could smell their apathy for their followers and she failed to embrace any major faith which distressed her parents to no end. Then, as she wandered near the city gates to watch travelers arrive she met someone a bit different. He had to be the most jovial, high-spirited elf ever to visit Waterdeep. Rhistel, or Rhis, noticed her stares and came to greet her. Befuddled by his convivial attitude, she asked why he did not take his visit more seriously. “Life should be filled with good times and laughter! These merchants work so hard for their wealth, but I never see them enjoy it!” That took her aback as she thought of her own dour-faced parents in their all too serious lives. Seeing her interest, he told her about his adventures in the High Forest and his many travels. When she expressed shock that he could just go off adventuring on a whim, he laughed, “How else would you go? After heavy thought? Best to go on a whim, before you can change your mind.” That too left her stunned, and as she asked more about him, Rhis began to tell her about his goddess Lurue, the Unicorn Queen. Far from the distant and uncaring gods of the temple district, Lurue felt more connected to her followers and the world. When she mentioned that, Rhis nodded and told her about his trip to the Unicorn Run: a river descending the southern face of the Star Mounts. She’d heard of the place, a pristine forest where tradition held the gods of the forest walked. He smiled again, and nodded. He’d seen his goddess there, walking the forest in the guise of a unicorn. Then he knew which of all the gods deserved his worship. Awed as only a ten-year-old could be, Tess found her faith in service to the demi-god Lurue.Stories about heroic adventurers and daring deeds abounded, as more than a few of those adventurers passed through the city’s markets in search of rare items or provisions on their journeys further north. Tess stood in awe of them… they were all so… stupid. Running around in ancient ruins or fighting off hordes of monsters! Getting maimed or killed! Stabbed, shot, bitten, clawed, poisoned, plague-stricken. Driven mad by horrors below. What kind of fool ran off into that sort of danger? And yet… they did so much good, even as they ran off in search of dubious treasures. Someone needed to keep an eye on those morons. Patch them up.At the age of 14, Tess saw the gods cast from the heavens during the Time of Troubles, causing her to doubt their real power and the nature of her world. At the time, she had been studying Lurue’s faith and seeking guidance as to her future profession. The crisis of the gods did at last conclude, with the fallen deities returning to their celestial homes. Sadly, that happy ending came at Waterdeep’s expense. Myrkul, Lord of Bones and former god of death, attacked the city in a desperate bid for power. He attempted to slay the adventurers who had resisted him, the very people whose actions brought this chaos to an end. With Myrkul slain, two of those adventurers ascended to become gods themselves. Leaving behind ruins in Waterdeep’s dock district. Tess ran out to volunteer what little medical aid she could. She saw the importance of healing those brave heroes that had stood against such evil, and too in the healing of all those wounded in those battles. She took it as a sign from Lurue, dedicating herself to the healing arts so that she could keep adventurers alive and clean up after their messes."9/18/2017 13:02:35,Adelina Thann,Human,Sorceress,"The downward slide in prominence of many noble Waterdhavian Houses has been just one of the many consequences of the Spellplague.  Though once powerful and influential, House Thann and House Wands had both slowly diminished in status since the initial outbreak in 1385, the Year of Blue Fire.  Determined to reverse this decrease in standing, Rhammas Thann III and Marcina Wands saw a union between their houses as an ideal beginning to restore their previous prominence.The result of the union?  Adelina Cassandra Thann - her parents’ best hope for the future of their bloodlines.  From an early age Adelina showed her proclivity towards arcane magic, perhaps a result of both sides of her lineage breeding true.  She was tutored briefly by her cousins in House Wands before they abruptly canceled the lessons, stating that Adelina was “too stubborn” to be taught.  She lasted even less time at the fabled Blackstaff Tower, where she was dismissed within a week for being “too unsuited to a life of quiet study and scholarship.”  Though the apple of Rhammas’ eye, her father was livid upon learning that Adelina was discharged from the very school of magic created by her many times great-grandfather, Khelben Arunsun.Upon reaching her majority at the age of sixteen, Adelina was granted several vineyards in the South to control and maintain.  Meant as a way for her to prove herself worthy of managing the family business, she considers the job tedious and prefers to delegate the work to others.  Paying only enough attention to be able to take a controlling hand when things go badly, she has charmed her bailiff and steward into performing all the menial, though necessary, day-to-day management duties.  Adelina is only known to visit her holdings when her quarterly percentage of profits is due, which she promptly fritters away in the typical spendthrift ways associated with young nobles.  This attitude towards work and money had gotten Adelina through most of her teenage years and into her early twenties, right up until she met Renaer.When not slumming it at the taverns and festhalls in the Dock Ward with other bored young nobles, Adelina can often be found at Tymora’s Fancy, a gambling establishment in the North Ward.  It was there that she first laid eyes on Renaer Neverember, the son of the Open Lord of Waterdeep.  Though Renaer has only spoken to her once or twice, Adelina harbors a secret crush on him and is jealous of his relationship with Laraelra Harsard.  In an effort to draw his attention towards her and away from Laraelra, Adelina accepted an invitation to join the “Disciples of Darkness,” a group of indolent noble scions who claim to supplicate devils for their own petty ends.  In reality, the false cult laughed their way through pseudo-religious rituals around smoky braziers before degenerating into bouts of excessive drinking and partying, customarily held on the first of each month.On the first of Flamerule, Adelina was held late supervising a meeting of vintners at one of House Thann’s warehouses in the Trades Ward.  When she arrived at the meeting of the Disciples of Darkness, it was to discover a ritual chamber covered in blood and gore.  Her fellow cultists had been brutally dismembered and the pieces appeared ravaged by claws and fangs.  As Adelina surveyed the room in shock, the central brazier blazed up, radiating a malevolent crimson hue.  Drawn towards the light like a moth to a flame, she approached the brazier only to have a searing pain drive into her chest like a lance.When Adelina woke the next day, it was in her own bed in House Thann’s villa.  She was about to dismiss the horrible memory as a nightmare until she felt an echo of the searing pain from the prior evening emanating from her chest.  Ripping open her bedrobe, Adelina could only stare in shock at the crimson mark of Asmodeus branded into her chest.  Raising her eyes slowly to the mirror across the room, she was further shocked to discover a book imp grinning maliciously at her from atop the furnishing.  Confused and scared out of her mind, she threw on the nearest clothes to hand and rushed out of the house, only stopping when she made it to one of the seedy establishments in the Dock Ward.  Tossing a handful of gold at the proprietor, she ran up the stairs to the first vacant room and locked the door behind her, only to hear a voice squeak out in a language she didn’t know but she could understand, “We can do this alllll day!”Adelina spun around, her hands covering her mouth in surprise.  The imp had followed her!  And it was speaking!  As the enormity of what had happened the previous night slowly sunk in, Adelina knew her life would never be the same."9/18/2017 13:51:48,Andom Perronick,Human,Cleric,"His father, Jurgo, was a local official in the mountain town of Pinyon Fork, and pushed him to enter the bureaucracy.  He secures Andom a position as a clerk for the regional governor.  Growing up, the family was not particularly religious, but Andom’s father would sometimes bring the family to attend services at the temple of Amaunator. His mother’s name is Pret.  He is an only child.  When he was growing up, he would often go climbing on the rocky cliffs surrounding the town.At the governorate in Cupriston, as an official clerk, Andom had privileged access to all the texts in the state library.  One day, while perusing the titles, he happened to come across a text called “The Ashes of the Gods”, by La Rang Chen. It’s an encyclopedia of all the gods thought to have died.  As he flips through the book, he comes across an entry for Auppenser.  When he reads the name, it’s like an icicle is driven into his brain, as he is exposed, for just a second, to the divine essence of Auppenser.   When he comes to, he’s captivated.  He reads the entry on Auppenser in the book, then he pours through the library for all the texts which might mention the god,  He pieces together that Auppenser still lives, but in a deep sleep, and that his followers are all gone.  In reading about his values and precepts, Andom feels a sense of real connection.  Over the next few year, he pores over the few texts in the library that give even a passing mention to Auppenser, and tries to learn everything he can from them.  He teaches himself to meditate.  As well, he focuses on trying to develop a more stoic outlook on life.  During this period, one of his biggest supports was his friend Birmo Stubb, a halfling and a fellow clerk.  Initially, when Andom told Birmo about his new interest in Auppenser, he was not taken seriously.  But after some time, Birmo finally understood that Andom was a sincere believer.  Shortly before Andom’s departure, Birmo converted to the Church of Auppenser in a private ceremony in his apartment.  Departure:  It was in the back of his head for a while, but when he converts Birmo, he becomes acutely aware of how little he still knows about Auppenser or His former church.  He realizes that he cannot solidly reestablish the church if he remains ignorant about the fundamentals of his faith.  He resolves to go wandering in order to learn, both to find texts and other sources of knowledge that might not have made it to his library, and to try to find spiritual enlightment and wisdom, which could point the way to Auppenser, in his travels.  Andom bought some travelling equipment, resigned his commission, said his farewells, and left.  Birmo stayed behind to continue work as a clerk.  When Andom had brought up the issue of Auppenser, and especially when he resigned his commission, his father Jurgo Perronick strongly disapproved,  seeing the Slumbering God as being even less worth the trouble of working with than a regular, living god.  As a going away present, Birmo gave him a poncho he had made; this poncho is now one of Andom’s most prized possessions. Andom carries a journal with him as he tries to reassemble the shattered faith.  In it, he writes down all the information on Auppenser that he is able to find in his researches, as well as the sensations and thoughts he experienced during profound moments and contacts with the divine, his personal musings, and any other information or bits of wisdom which might help to guide a future Church of Auppenser.  The book is thus both a personal journal and a holy text.After leaving Cupriston, Andom wandered the land looking for libraries and ruins that might contain shreds of information about his adopted faith.  As he traveled, he would pick up odd jobs here and there.  He had some skill with cooking (simple stews mainly) and so was able to find some work as a chef for merchant caravans.Although he strives towards the stoic ideal of a servant of Auppenser, he often falls short in rage and frustration.  Although he would be unwilling to admit it, much of his motivation for seeking to achieve great deeds is selfish; he wants the respect that comes from heroics and mighty accomplishments.  Preoccupied with proving himself, especially to himself.  Because of this, he will often choose the bolder, flashier, more ambitious choice out of an array of options, even when that may not be well advised. He is scared of deep water. He is close friends with his first convert, Birmo Stubb, a clerk in Cupriston.  His father Jurgo Perronick tried to steer him into the bureaucracy, and strongly discouraged his new faith.  Andom’s attitude towards his father contains elements of resentment and pride, despite genuinely loving him."9/18/2017 15:46:24,Sigrid Thorbendotter,Human,Barbarian,"The birth of Sigrid was received with mixed feelings by the people of Rek. For one, it was a blessing, after years of being childless, the Chief finally had an offspring. On the other hand, that offspring turned out to be a girl; tradition dictates that the firstborn is supposed to succeed the Chief, however, the law forbids women from becoming Chieftains. Two years later, Liulfr was born and anointed as the successor to the throne of Rek.It’s not that women are regarded as inferior or that they need protection, the gods know that Rek women need no one to protect them, but their roles are far more important than government or war, they are tasked with the spiritual and social wellbeing of the society. As such, from a small age young Sigrid was taught the traditions, laws and history of her people, molding her to one day succeed the eldest. And for a time, she was happy, that is until she was 12, the age when all Rek citizens, men and women alike, are required to learn basic defense and weapons training. The axes became an extension of herself, battle training was the highlight of her days and soon, one day becoming the elder, was no longer as important as the excitement of combat.Training after “boot camp” was an uphill battle for Sigrid, her mother and father were not eager to allow her “hobby” to continue, yet she pressed on and became one of the fiercest warriors of her age. She trained and trained in her ever shrinking free time. Yet no matter how much she trained, her fate was sealed, real combat or chief hood were out of her reach, she was almost ready to give up and accept her face and then, Liulfr turned 12 and began his combat training, what she saw horrified her. Liulfr’s combat style was not honorable, he bragged about his dirty triumphs and humiliated his opponents, this, was not the way a future chief was supposed to behave. Attempts were made to modify this behavior, but sometimes it is futile to fight against someone’s nature.5 years passed, Sigrid was now 19 and Liulfr 17. The two of them and a small contingent were sent to a frontier village facing raids from an expanding neighbor. Having talked to envoys declaring their intentions to annex Rek territory, Sigrid concluded that staying and fight was the obvious course of action, however, Liulfr had ideas of his own. He arranged a secret meeting with the envoys and gave up the town in exchange for some gold and exotic items from foreign lands. Hours later, Sigrid, Liulfr, the warriors and the villagers who agreed to leave town without a fight were en route back to the capital. Sigrid watched as those brave villagers who stayed behind to defend their property were being slaughtered and their town razzed to the ground. This was the last straw, by Tempus, she would no longer stand by and allow her cowardly brother to shame her family name. When they were back and Liulfr explained how the raiders’ numbers were superior and the town served no strategic or economic value, Sigrid lost it, she charged at her brother. He was bigger and stronger, but Sigrid smarter and more determined, they battled for minutes that seemed like hours, at the end Sigrid stood above a defeated Liulfr. Her time studying and learning the laws of traditions of Rek were finally put to good use, citing old law concerning the wives of death Chiefs, Sigrid issued a challenge to his brother, she would leave, and return only in glorious triumph, which meant having earned the admiration and respect of both enemies and friends upon which a final duel between her and her brother would decide who would finally become Chief.Storming out of the great hall before anyone could stop or talk to her, she walked away with only what was already on her, her trusty axes, her battle armor and the few rations left from her trip to the frontier.3 weeks into her pilgrimage, she met a group of villagers who were trying to hunt down a slave party who had raided their village and took their possessions and women. Sigrid was able to track them down and simply walked into their camp with the villagers behind her, demanded the release the prisoners, and when the slavers refused, Asvald and Athils (her two small axes) flew across the air and found their targets in the chest of two slavers, using the ensuing confusion to charge against the biggest man, who was possibly the leader. In a swift move, she took her battle axe and slayed the man. The villagers were successful in killing or apprehending the rest of the slavers, soon, the slavers were inside the cages and the women free. Upon returning to the village, a small elf girl who didn’t seem to belong there, caught Sigrid’s attention. The frail elf didn’t seem to have a home and was eager to follow Sigrid on her journey, for her part, Sigrid was happy to have someone to talk to, also believing that if she ever wants to be Chief, she must take care of the defenseless first."9/17/2017 23:07:55,Tanna Bramsdottir,Human,Barbarian,"The first time she tried to summon her totem animal, she nearly froze to death before returning to the barbarian encampment empty-handed.  Five days she spent out in the wilderness, slowly growing more hungry and more numb as the certainty that this was her path faded into nothingness and she was left with only herself, small and empty and alone.  She'd tried so hard to learn their ways, despite not being one of them, honing herself to be stronger and work harder and be as harsh and severe as the north winds.  But no spirit animal came, and only then did she let the truth sink into her heart like a cold heavy stone.She was unworthy.  Too civilized, too ignorant, an outsider.Maybe it was cowardly to leave.  She'd learned much from the tribe, made friends, learned their ways to the best of her ability, learned how to live off even the most uninhabitable tundra lands, and somewhere deep down she was grateful for that, but the rawness of her heart made it impossible for her to stay.  So she wandered in the only direction she knew, finally arriving home to her modest childhood home.Her father had always been a wild soul, so different from her quarter-dwarf mother, who was calm and solid and steady as the earth.  He was gone often, always wandering the wilds and bringing home strange artifacts and stranger creatures, spouting cliche little proverbs about protecting nature and the magic of the earth.  He always grew restless before even a fortnight passed, promised to be back soon, and left again.  If Tanna's mother ever minded his long absences, she never showed it, content with taking good care of her home.He barely made it home the day he died, weak and ashen with a death rattle already in his throat.  He told Tanna and her mother he loved them, and as his weathered hand weakly grasped Tanna's, he whispered, the last hoarse words of an old man, ""Be good.  Be good.""She stayed with her mother for a little while, but before long her soul ached with wanderlust once more.""You have much of your father in you,"" her mother finally said, ""and you're wearing holes in my carpet,"" and all but pushed her out the front door.Finding her cousin Adric was both harder and more joyful than she'd anticipated.  Deep in some caves finding treasure and fighting elementals, he was nearly impossible to track down, but seeing his face again after a year and a half was like seeing the sun for the first time.  When was the last time she'd laughed, or even truly smiled without the weight of the world on her shoulders?  He didn't comment on her appearance, but she caught his sidelong looks, and she knew him well enough to recognize his concern.  They'd practically grown up together, only one town apart, and everything Adric had learned about fighting he'd taught her as well.  They both shared the same hint of dwarf blood from their mothers, naturally strong and wide and both possessing the same love of the thrill of battle.  And the same love of good strong drink, and good food, and beautiful women.They sat around a fire that night, drinking all of Adric's ale and telling each other all the stories they'd missed over the past eighteen months, embellishing and exaggerating until they were in stitches from laughter.  It hit her like a wave, deeper than oceans, the way she loved him, the way she loved this, aching with travel and laughter, drunk and overwhelmed with joy, once again filled with the surety that the world was a vast and unimaginably beautiful place.They traveled together for a while, drinking and laughing and camping their way through every imaginable climate, making friends wherever they could and fighting all manner of beasts and fiends, picking up companions here and there and staying up nights staring at the stars and telling stories and laughing themselves sick.  They stayed in taverns when it was clean and convenient, but Tanna loved sleeping on a bedroll on the dirt under a canopy of trees and clouds and wild night sky more than any bed.As much as she loved the camaraderie of a party of like-minded adventurers, even more entrancing was every new village they found, every new and wild and far-flung tribe that she could convince or bribe to teach her about the land, what plants were good to eat and how to find water and what to avoid and how to survive.  She made every climate and every biome her friend, coaxing out its secrets with bright-eyed adoration, and those nights when she fell asleep with charred meat and sweet mead in her stomach with stars whirling overhead, she thought she could happily live like that forever.But there was something that still whispered to her, in her heart of hearts, something deep in the earth that was ancient and powerful and benevolent and was ever calling her by name.  She began dreaming of the sun, of warm wind and fast clouds and the soft susurrus of tall grass.  And a voice, deep and mellow and honey-gold, speaking words she couldn't yet understand.  So she and Adric parted ways, he compelled home for the love of his family, and she unable to shake the thought of south, south from her mind."9/18/2017 14:48:03,Evgeni,human,sorcerer,"The Patrin are a nomadic community of Central Europe-like place.  They are stereoypically thought of as vagrants and theives.  But, they have a full robust culture of mystics, entertainers, traders, artisans, and philosophers.  They have dark hair usually grown long.  Patrin make fine wigs which command a fair price but take quite some time to make due to the nature of the materials.  Skin tones range from pale olive and tan all the way to deep chestnut brown with close relatives typically sharing similar complexions.  Eye colors other than brown or black are extremely rare.  Body types also range from short and slight to tall and broad, with little variation between men and women.  There are occasional pockets of half evles among the Patrin.Evgeni is not one of that sort of Patrin.  He is a thief, a burgler to be exact.  Bands of Patrin will sometimes sneak into communities at night to rob from unattended businesses or carry away other valuables.  These items will then be sold at the next town for a much better price than would be availble from a local fence.Abraxas the Unfathomable is one of the dreaded Demon Kings that Conn defeated and sealed away before the founding of the Empire.  Evgeni accidentally freed Abraxas while robbing the Temple of Bufkabufta, a monlithic monument built nearly 600 years ago.  This is considered an equally heinous crime in the Citystate of Nexus, the Connen Empire, and among the Council of Free Kingdoms.Bufkabufta was a king allied to the Empire who ruled the area during the Decline.  He is considered one of the honored Host of Kings in the Connen theocracy but is also celebrated locally for his benevolence and wisdom.  Bufkabufta is known in legend across most of the civilized world as a proxy for especially kind, benevolent rulership.  Abraxas gifted him the power to use magic and commanded him to sow chaos and destruction.  Evgeni has not seen or been contacted by Abraxas since that time.  He is unsure if the command was meant to be taken literally or if Abraxas has any interest in checking in on him.  That is for the best as Evgeni is wanted in most civilized nations and traveling has been difficult.""Ok, so...  We were in the Temple of Bufkabufta and we were robbing the place. Granted we, we were but it didn't start like that.  We were told that the temple was built on top of a ruin from even earlier than Bufkabufta that we could get into an find something to make a little money.  The ruins were there but it took forever to get to them because of all the people trying to keep us out of the temple.  Once we got in there were a ton of traps, bad ones.  We were almost ready to cut our losses and get out of there and we found the tomb thing.  It was a big stone door probably 20 feet high and just as wide.And there was this poem, and it said something, but it was a riddle.  And the answer to the riddle was that you had to light something on fire, we didn't really know the language, I mean we did, but in retrospect, no.  No, I guess we didn't.  But, we figured out that you had to light something on fire to ""unlock"" something.  And we had to light a couple of things on fire, but we put em out when they didn't work.  Until the last one, the last fire did something because the whole door of the ""tomb"" thing shifted and moved and rolled over to the side and this thing comes out.  And it's got like the body and arms of a man but snakes for legs, and it has a rooster's head and a golden sheild but it's not holding the shield it's just like wearing it up on it's shoulder.  It's got a scourge in one hand and in the other, the arm with the sheild, it's got the reins of these four huge white warhorses.  And they're hooked up to this gold chariot, but the thing isn't in the chariot it's just floating in the air above the chariot.  And this thing is probably 14' tall and the horses are huge and there's four of them and a gold chariot so all of this comes rushing up out of this tomb thing and it knocks over the oil lamp we were using to light things on fire.  And there was no wick in the lamp.  We took it out to get a bigger flame to light stuff on fire. In retrospect, that was a mistake.  But anyway I honestly didn't see it get knocked over because the whole time this thing is talking and not like with its mouth... beak.  It's talking inside my head, and the guys I was with too I guess, but they're dead.  Probably.  And its all talking about how it's ""Abraxas the Unfathomable""  and we freed it and it's going to give us power and then it screams at us to ""Go forth into the world and bring CHAOS AND RUIN!""  And then it flew away.  Like the horses ran but they ran up the air and the whole thing just flew off.  And that's when we noticed the fire which by this time is admittedly, pretty huge.  I got separated from Hristo and Petya while we were escaping and haven't seen them since then.  And now I can cast spells."""9/18/2017 7:38:43,Alexander Springbreeze,human,druid,"	One day a halfling woman named Cora Springbreeze was out gathering herbs near the forest by her village. The baby was covered in moss in a shallow pit at the base of a large tree. She reached for the child, who was giggling and smiling, despite his circumstances. She took the baby home and her and her husband Wellby cleaned all the moss off of him. However, no matter how often they cleaned the moss, the moss on his shoulders always grew back, and would even cover that spot oh his clothing. They looked for his parents, but never managed to find them, and eventually took him in as their own. They named him Alexander Springbreeze, and from that day on he was loved and would want for nothing.  	Growing up in the Harmonias Knolls was always interesting, the town trived off of being a middle ground for people to meet up and do bussiness. People came from far and wide to meet and do bussiness here, because of how nice the people were, and more importantly, the wonderful food. It wasn't uncommon that older folk would come and vacation, and once and awhile someone would end up staying. When Alexander was a young child the village was entirely Halfling, but by the time he was a teen a few humans, an elf woman, her human husband and thier 2 half elf daughters Tera and April (who Alexander had a crush on), and a grumpy old dwarf had built homes in the village. Alexander was always a bit of an odd child, everyone was a little taken back by the moss that grew on his shoulders and his talking to plants and many off the villagers took to calling him Moss Ball, but his sunny disposition always made them friends in the end. 	For as long as Alexander could remember he had been talking to plants. They would tell him stories, and he was always at ease in their pressence. The plants always called him Pothos, he never knew why, but also never felt the need to question it. He was actually quite fond of the name, as the name Alexander just never sounded right to him. He loved plants of all varieties and when he was of age to start working would spend his days gathering wild herbs, fruits, and mushrooms. The villagers loved him for it because nobody has ever gathered as much as him, it was as if the plants were finding him they thought. Alexander was truely happy, so much so that nobody could remember him being anything else.	One day when Alexander was out strolling through the meddow he ran into a beautiful large blue flower. He spent the entire day talking to that flower and when darkness came and Alexander was about to say his goodbyes, the flower thanked him for his time and asked him to please come by in the morning, and that there would be something waiting for him. The next day Alexander went back into the forest to find the flower, but it was gone. In it's place was a small bundle of leaves, which upon inspection, contained 4 seeds. Alexander asked the surrounding grass what happened, but grass thinks of little besides ""bask and eat"" so he took bundled the leaves back up and took the seeds back home with him.  	Just before ariving at his village, he saw a dense black smoke on the horrizon. He ran and found a group of bandits surrounded all of the villagers, pillaging the houses and harrasing the half elf April. For the first time in his life, Alexander became angery, and he leaped on the first bandit he saw and bashed him over the head with his staff. Seeing this 2 of the other bandits grabbed their swords and before they could do get close enough to attack massive thorny vines grew out from the moss on Alexanders' shoulders, wrapped around his arms and lashed out ripping the the throat of one, and choking the life out of the other. Then an arrow went wizzing by alexander, he turned to see another bandit with a bow reloaded and aimed right at him. As he released his arrow Alexander took the bandit he was choking and moved him so that the arrow struck him. He released the now dead bandit and with his other, now vineless hand, reached out towards the bandit and shot out a liquid directly into his face. The bandit screamed with pain as he fell to the ground, the skin on his face bubbeling and melting away. ""someone help!"" he heard, coming from the burning home of the grumpy old dwarf, Rold Frostbeard. Alexander rushed into the burning home and came back out moments later, with the dwarf in his arms. The moss on his right shoulder on fire he quickly smothered the flame. He then heard a scream, as he looked up he saw April, with a bandit's knife to her throat. Alexander disapeared, and repeared as a massive wolf behind the bandit, tearing at the bandit's throat. 	With the last bandit dispatched, and all of the villagers saved, Alexander turned back into his normal self, covered in the blood of the bandits and burns covering his right arm. He fell to his knees and cried for the first time in his life. Not entirely sure what he did, or how he did it, all he could think about was all the pain he inflicted. His mother stood up from the crowd and went over to him, as she neared and he looked up at her she stepped back, for just a moment, afraid. Seeing this Alexander returned to his wolf form, and ran away, dropping one of his 4 seeds behind him. "9/18/2017 17:00:26,Hideyama Kurimasa,Human,Samurai,"_Hideyama Kurisuma is a true warrior. With strength, cunning, and leadership, he can best any foe. As a samurai, he goes against custom by being his own master. To most, he is a Ronin. Masterless. Without cause. Lost. But to him, it is more freeing than the greatest fight. Higher than the tallest mountain. Stronger than the hardest steel. Let us start where Hideyama's story began. He was born in a humble monastery in Quyu. Trained from the age of 3, he quickly mastered the art. By age 16, he was taken to the dragon temple, but did not succeed in being selected. His prowess, however, did not go unnoticed. A great samurai master, known as Ryku quickly took a liking to him, and trained him in the military arts. When Hideyama was 20, he fought his first battle, with a small group of bandits that had been harassing the locals. He continued like this for many months, then Ryku decided to teach him tactics. Hideyama, being a good student and eager to learn more, accepted the promotion to Lieutenant, and given a horse. He trained hard and long, and eventually, after 2 long, hard years of work, was granted his own small group of foot soldiers. After many successful raids, Hideyama's name was well known in the area. But the Emperor also took notice. A samurai that seemed to be sworn to no one. The Emperor sent envoys to meet this mysterious samurai, and offer him vassalage under the Emperor, the rightful ruler of the land. Hideyama was surprised that the Emperor had taken such notice, and accepted. His platoon was immediately moved to the temple of the Dragon in the Imperial city. His job was to oversee a small army that defended the city walls. It was a daunting task, but Hideyama accepted the challenge. Nothing eventful happened, until Lord Ido slaughtered the other Dragoneyes , the keepers of the peace, and Lord Sethos became the self proclaimed emperor 3 years later. Hideyama joined the rebellion, along with many of his troops. The battle to escape was long and bloody. Hundreds of good men died that day. Realizing his mistake in trusting that a vassalship would be beneficial to him, he vowed that he would be his own man. Sworn to no one. Commander of himself. He set out to find himself in the wilderness. On his journeys, he met several people. On his journey, he found a great and mighty temple. The monks there were kind to him, and noticed his damaged equipment. They granted him a set of armour, and a few weapons. First, a lordly set of samurai armour, faded red with gold lining, of great thickness. A long cavalry sword called an Odachi, a shorter sword called a Wazikashi, and a long spear with a rectangular banner on it called a Yari. He set off, and with these wapons did many great things. During his exile, there were a few people that stood out to him. His mentor in the woods, Hokichi Royama. A great sensei, and a master of forgotten techniques. Hideyama learned much about being a samurai, and learned the true weight of being a Ronin. His companion, for a time, a fellow ronin, Sakuraba Kojimo, who taught him the art of resisting mental and physical tortures. His Kenjutsu Hansi (master) who did not have a name, but helped him master Kenjutsu himself. His student, Kumage Shohei, whom he taught almost everything he knew, and sent off on his own path. When Hideyama emerged from his self induced exile, 18 years later, he was a changed man. His experiences had taught him much. At the ripe age of 43, his hair was graying, but he was ready. In the woods, he had learned of an ancient temple. One that would lead him to a new land, where civil unrest was unheard of. He searched for this temple for many years, almost losing hope before unearthing a new clue. From book, to artifact to unbelievable rumor, he searched. When he finally got a location, he has much time had passed. 4 long years he had searched, and finally it would come to fruition. He set out for the temple, and the journey was quite peaceful. As he climbed the steps, he began to wonder. What would this new land be like? Who would be in it? Would he be out of place in it? Would he be able to speak with the natives? These thought ran through his head, but did not deter him. He reached the temple. It was not very grand, in fact it was quite small. The temple looked like most other temples, but most of the ornamentation was gone, and the colours faded. The majesty that most temples have was absent. It felt like it had been abandoned, forgotten, or perhaps hidden. Hideyama entered the temple, and immediately was assailed by a horrible stench. His time with Sakuraba served him well, and he pressed on. At the end of the temple, there was a statue of the mirror dragon. He knelt at the statue, and rested for a time. He didn’t know how long he sat there, but suddenly he felt like he was in a different place. The gods had granted his wish. He opened his eyes and looked around. He was in a large, circular room with a bar in the middle. The bar’s skirting and openings were reminiscent of the entrance to a temple. The walls were mosaics of red and gold. Hideyama was kneeling on a cushion at the bar. A portly white man walked up, and said with a subtle but distinct accent “Hello. I’m Mitchever, the barkeep. Can I get you anything to drink?” Hideyama was confused by this man, but did not let it show on his face, regardless of his mask. To be polite, he raised the mask and asked for some spring water. When his drink arrived, he inquired about this world, wondering if it was the haven he had been led to believe. Hideyama learned much in the next few hours, from Mitchever, and a few other patrons. But the most intriguing fact was the promise of great power, locked in a mysterious tower. The Tower of the Fool. It only appeared for short times, and quite infrequently. Hideyama felt that finding this power would teach him more about himself, and decided to wait for it to appear..."9/18/2017 12:46:35,Cerise Firevale,Human,Fighter,"	Cerise Firevale was born on the first day of summer alongside her twin sister, Ferra. While the two shared nearly identical faces, they were almost the complete antithesis of one another. 	Cerise was gifted with the vibrant red hair of her father's, while Ferra inherited her mother's jet-black locks.	Cerise grew to be curious, generous and unerringly kind, whereas Ferra became colder and more distant the more she aged.	The more the girls grew it became clearer and clearer that they were fated to be polar opposites of one another. It was odd, to say the least, but Cerise never seemed to mind. Being the kindhearted girl that she was, she always tried to get along with her sister when they were younger.	That all changed the moment it came time for their schooling at age 7.	The Firevale family is a house of nobility that is well-known among the townspeople of Ashbourne. They have a stunning reputation as a family of spellcasters, every single member of the core bloodline becoming a successful sorcerer or sorceress... That is, until Cerise.	The polarity that existed between the twins appeared to extend even to their talents, and saw Ferra being gifted with immense magical acuity just begging to be fostered and developed into terrifying thaumaturgical prowess.	Cerise, on the other hand, possessed no magical talent whatsoever. Try as she might, she couldn't even conjure a simple Prestidigitation spell. She tried and tried, desperately wanting not to disappoint her parents, but to no avail. She just didn't have what it took to become a sorceress and continue the family tradition. When she begged her sister for help, Ferra simply dismissed her, saying she had always known this would happen, that she would be the one to further the family's tradition. According to her, Cerise hadn't the temperament or the mental fortitude for the magical arts. Ferra then left her there, that conversation marking the beginning of Cerise's new life.	Her parents pretended not to mind. They enrolled her in martial training instead, to see if she would be better suited with a sword or an axe in her hand rather than a book or a staff. When she immediately began to excel, Cerise could tell that her parents truly gave up on her. They tried to disguise their disappointment, but Cerise could tell. The longer it went on the more it felt like the love they expressed toward her was just a lie, an obligation. A formality. But it didn't last long.	As time went on Cerise's parents grew colder toward her, similar to the way Ferra had. Cerise suspected that she embarrassed them. That they were tired of the residents of Ashbourne asking about her, querying why she wasn't being raised as a sorceress like Ferra was. Cerise began to feel that it was her fault, that something was wrong with her. She felt like a guest in her own home. A guest that was overstaying her welcome.	Cerise began to wander outside of her family's estate. She felt claustrophobic within its walls, as if she would be suffocated if she stayed there too long. It was refreshing to talk to the townspeople. They never judged her the way her family did. The streets of Ashbourne soon became Cerise's new home where she would stay whenever she wasn't otherwise kept within the Firevale estate. Her family never cared enough to ask where she was during the day, instead showering Ferra with attention.	At the age of 10 Cerise met a man from a party of adventurers that often came to Ashbourne to spend a few nights at the inn and resupply. The man's name was Bardren, a roguish type with a dazzling smile and a kind heart. He gave silver pieces to the children around town, who would always go and spend them on candy. Cerise would always be seen trailing behind him whenever he was around. He told her the most fascinating stories about the outside world. She'd never left the town of Ashbourne, left completely ignorant of life elsewhere. Bardren told her tales of towering castles, crumbling caves, terrifying dungeons, and people of all kinds.	The only experience Cerise had with other races was the innkeeper – she was an elf. Aside from that, at least as far as she knew, all of Ashbourne was human. Bardren spoke of dwarves, drow elves, halflings, gnomes, even the living dead. The more stories he told her the more she desperately wanted to see it for herself.	Eventually Cerise told Bardren of the way her family had been treating her. Though clearly upset by it, he promised her that he wouldn't make any trouble over it. He didn't want to make things worse for her. Instead he continued to do what he always did, telling her stories whenever she asked and allowing her to follow him around. He soon became the caring family Cerise so painfully craved. As long as Bardren continued to visit Ashbourne, Cerise had something to look forward to.	Years passed. Cerise began to find that as she matured, the more she thought of Bardren differently. Dreams of him taking her to see the world were sometimes replaced by the two of them having a wedding together. These bittersweet dreams often ended with Cerise waking in the middle of the night, crying. She didn't want to think of him that way. Those feelings would only serve to remind her that he wasn't her real family, that her real family had all but abandoned her when she was just a child.	On her 20th birthday Cerise went out to find Bardren, who had promised to meet her. She couldn't find him. She did, however, find his party, looking much worse for wear, as though they had been through hell and back. Fearing the worst, she asked them what had happened.	Bardren was dead.	Cerise stood there for the better part of an hour. When she looked down at her hand she was holding a bright gold amulet. One of the party members had placed it in her hand, saying Bardren had wanted her to have it. With that they left her there, in shock and very much alone.	Cerise decided to leave that night. She wouldn't stay in the house that had shunned her for another moment. Waiting until the dead of night, she gathered the things most important to her and crept outside. She made her way into the guardhouse within her family's estate and took a set of armor, as well as a sword and shield. It was the only time she had ever stolen anything and she felt terrible, but Bardren had taught her that the world is wrought with danger.	Cerise had a goal, and that was to earn her family's respect. She refused to be ashamed of her surname, instead embracing it and hoping to one day return as a successful and proud warrior. Until then, she would travel the lands and help as many people as she could."9/18/2017 4:29:40,Randal Wolfswit,human,fighter,"	Randal’s mother, Anet Cor Marak, came from a well-respected merchant family living in the city of Ankhapur on the Lake of Steam. The “bloodline of fire” (hereditary traits passed down from the efreeti rulers of nearby Calimshan’s past) burned strongly in her family, and showed clearly in Anet. Her hair flickered with all the motion and color of flames, and the ever-present scent of smoke followed wherever she went.When Anet came of age she traveled to Waterdeep to pursue her own ambitions, eager to establish herself as a successful businesswoman. While not the largest or most successful in Waterdeep, her trading company has established itself as a notable authority in coastal trading. Anet met Randal’s father while living in Waterdeep. A mediocre wizard and member of the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors, Grim Wolfswit assisted Anet when her distinctive appearance drew hostility from groups who mistook her for a sorcerer. Each sparking curiosity in the other, the two courted and after several years married. Anet & Grim had two sons, Gewar and his younger brother Randal. The bloodline of fire continued, though faintly, in the brothers.Gewar never looked kindly upon his brother, and from his very birth he had seen Randal as a thief. His parent’s time and love kept being squandered on the little brat, when really he deserved it more. Growing up, Gewar never held back in fights with Randal. Randal in turn learned very quickly how to protect himself, how to take a hit, and how to give back as good as he got. Randal spent his whole childhood fighting someone bigger and stronger who genuinely hated him, and grew up to be someone who never backed down even against overwhelming odds. In Randal’s teen years, he grew stronger than his brother who chose not to fight him physically after having lost for the first time. Gewar’s resentment only multiplied, while Randal became restless. The frequent fistfights had been a much needed routine for him, and without his usual opponent he sought out an alternative. He discovered vigilante groups like the Red Sashes, and took to the streets at night where he put his fists to good use. He learned cruel things operated in the city’s darkest corners, heard names like the Xanathar’s Guild.Gewar had long seen mastering his father’s trade, learning to work magic, would finally prove him the better and smarter son. As they grew older, Gewar’s insistence intensified to a level of harassment that burned into argument when Grim snapped at his demanding son. After the worst of those fights, Gewar despaired thinking his father would never share his arts. His despair turned to rage, his addled mind saw this as just one more thing stolen from him by Randal. He would solve this, and prove his worth all at once. Gewar stole magical implements from his father’s study and prepared a lethal trap. He planned to murder his brother using the very magic his father deemed him unworthy to learn. And he would watch it happen. Gewar set his trap and waited. He knew Randal came home late most nights, and he had prepared perfectly. Grim, laying awake that night, thought to get up and go speak to Gewar. He knew the boy showed promise, but had trouble getting him to proceed at the proper pace. Grim came out to see Randal stepping in, he saw Gewar waiting in the shadows, and his senses soon noted the mystical energies suffusing the room. In a moment of unthinking panic, Grim threw himself forward and knocked Randal out of the way of the trap. Randal looked up to see his father slain in agony as conjured spears of ice skewered him from all directions.Gewar went mad. He lept from hiding to beat his brother with his fists, shouting how Randal had taken his father from him. Randal took the first few hits, still too shocked to believe what he had seen. When he did piece it together, he knocked his brother off him with a single punch. Gewar unconscious on the floor, Randal went to his father’s side. Already he knew nothing could be done. A noise came from the stairs. He looked up to see his mother frozen in place, her features lost in silent horror. Randal couldn’t think, he felt guilt, imagined Anet blaming him for everything. He couldn’t face her, but he couldn’t leave her alone with his murderous brother. He took Gewar and left.Carrying the unconscious Gewar through side alleys and rarely used streets, he left for somewhere unhealthy. Randal met with the Agents of the Eye, what those in the Xanathar’s Guild called themselves. Slavers, blackmailers, thieves, and worse. He dropped his brother at his feet. He’d heard the stories, he knew you couldn’t join the guild without a blood offering. Though Xanathar’s offerings required a family member, dead or given to the slavers. He joined that day, and never went home. Years in service to the Xanathar’s Guild wore on Randal’s mind. He’d tried not to think too much about his work, preferring to just act in service to the guild and collect his pay. He turned to Cyric’s teachings, hoping religion could help him accept his chosen path. Yet as time passed, he started to think himself a fool. He’d blamed himself for his father’s death, no one had done that to him. And he’d never even asked what it was his brother had attempted or why. He hadn’t cared, just cleaned it up. He didn’t even know any more whether or not his brother still lived. Randal reached a conclusion one day: he’d done nothing wrong the night his father died. Not until he’d joined the Xanathar’s Guild. And he’d spent years serving them, inflicting pain and death for his masters. Now he had done something worthy of the shame and guilt he’d felt that night. Randal considered that maybe it was too late, and what he’d done couldn’t be redeemed. But he knew trying had to feel better than continuing on this way. He left the Xanathar’s Guild as quietly as he could, hoping to leave little of a trail for them to follow. Similarly, he looked for a way out of Cyric’s church… but feared some divine retribution for his abandonment. His thoughts turned to the gods Cyric hated most: Mystra & Kelemvor. Kelemvor’s church taught the importance of honoring the dead, remembering what they had contributed in life and serving their families in trying times. Randal couldn’t speak to how many lives he had ended prematurely. He could be sure it hadn’t been countless, just that his mind struggled to forget what he had done. One day he might die and find himself in Kelemvor’s presence, judged as one of the False for betraying his vows to Cyric’s church. Maybe that inevitable sentence could be lessened by doing penance in service to Kelemvor’s faith. Maybe if he joined a group of adventurers he could find enough opportunities to redeem his past actions. If nothing else, perhaps he could do enough good he could face his mother without feeling so ashamed."9/18/2017 9:22:03,Penandin (Andi) Arewas,Human,Wizard,"Andi was born in a small town a stone’s throw from Telis. Her parents met abroad; since they were from the same area and visited the same markets in Telis, he from within the city and they were from the same area and visited the same markets in Telis, he from within the city and she from a village half a day’s journey out, they had a lot to talk about. It was an odd pair. Mother was a second-generation immigrant, raised practical and worldly, while father was a child of a family long known for its doctors of magic and administrators of wizard matters. He was getting older and restless, and she was intrigued with his restlessness despite his privilege. Their choice of place to settle down was tactical, not too close to his origin, not too far from hers, but adjoining Telis for its opportunity. She wasn’t anxious to start a family, and it was longer than he or his kin liked before Andi was born.When Andi was eight, she gained a brother and her mother left. It wasn’t entirely clear that the boy’s father was the same as hers. She hadn’t seen her mother since. Andi half-raised her much younger brother, adding an extra burden to the intense pressure to be a high achiever. Her father moved back to the family estate in the city and took the kids with him. He was out most of the time. Her brother was a bad combination of defiant and a little dumb. Her father grew sad and cool, and their relationship was turbulent.After an eternity, Andi made it out of first school and her father gladly paid her way to the top-tier boarding school of her choice, at the foot of the mountains outside of Scandrow. Her brother began military training soon after, in his early teens, and she would only see him once in all her time at school.The boarding school was full of rich girls and overqualified teachers who were delighted with any student who really wanted badly to learn. She was such a student. She ate up history, arcana, languages, and wealth studies. She was clearly fast-tracked for advanced wizardry. Always a straight-edge by necessity, she did not indulge much in her freedom away from home, finding more comfort in books than in friends. Her achievement made her unpopular; her skin, one shade darker than the crowd, subtly alienated her. Her strong opinions about the ways the other girls ought to be using their expensive time at school, and her liberty with snapping at them, didn’t help.Extra time was occupied by two newfound passions: botany and martial magic. Her introductory plants and lifeforms class introduced her to the astonishing variety in land flora. The teacher conspired with the groundskeeper to grant her a tiny plot to garden, eager to see a student pass in her studies from the labeled drawings in the required reading into the real world. Andi was not excellent at gardening, but she found unusually pure joy in her trivial successes at making life.As in many high-end boarding schools, there were exotic options for fitness credit; one on offer was combat spellcasting. The quiet, focused instructor became her first real friend at school. Andi would stay after class, half practicing, half confiding. With shared trust, the pair were able to go further than gym credit, taking on riskier combat techniques: fire, and blinding light. When Andi could finally relax with her magic, she found that she could move small objects or cause people to hear or feel brief illusions without much effort. After that, she had no end of fun sharing subtle magical jokes with her mentor and friend in class at the other girls’ expense.There was a cultural enrichment exchange program with the native dwarfish folk of the mountain. Unsophisticated but wise people, they often conferred with local earth elementals about weather or war. Andi studied up on Terran and excitedly enrolled. She would meet briefly with her large and profoundly foreign exchange student, and then she would trek with a donkey, a guide, and a few interested others up the valley. The natives were gruff but generous with their time, laughing at her Terran pronunciation mistakes and sending her on errands to find novel forest foodstuffs. In the evenings, she would be reluctant to leave. Never once did she see an elemental. Still, the folks’ grounded lifestyle rubbed off on her, feeding a lust for the outdoors and unknown places.Matters of the heart were never tidy for Andi. As an upperclassman, she cautiously tried at romance with the other girls a few times. Andi could never fully connect, and so she broke some hearts before she decided that now was not the time for her. In lulls she would often imagine where her mother had gone, and what kind of person she had become. Her memories of life before she left had become scattered and vague. It was an unconscious certainty to her that someday, she would have to find her and put her story together.The one time she saw her brother when her leave overlapped with his, she found that he was doing frustratingly well. Apparently, his intellect was better suited to tactic than primary math; he had risen to Corporal, re-stationed at a northern city at the border. Andi felt acutely that her life was on pause.Andi graduated half a year early. She rented for a time in metropolitan Scandrow, immediately catching a job as a low-level library administrator. Upper-echelon urban wizarding establishments knew the Arewas name. She did not tell her father she had exited school, and she had no intention to return to his sad and empty home, though she felt awful for scorning him so. Untied from all commitments at last, she experimented tentatively with pubs and intoxicants in her restlessness. Still, guilt over her lapse in discipline nagged her every day.Once, word got around that a bandit camp in the hills had been deserted all at once, leaving valuable goods behind; no one knew why. Seeing adventuring parties emerging, all intent on getting the first pick of the treasure, she decided that enough was enough waiting for her life to begin. She hastily purchased quite a lot of adventuring goods and some very nice leather armor, using up most of the money she had on her. She was able to convince some very loud young men that they could use a wizard on their way to the empty encampment. That party’s story ended prematurely when an injury halfway along the trail forced them to return to town. Anyway, she couldn’t cast in the stiff armor. The last night before arriving back in Scandrow, the young men decided to make up for their unrealized treasure by lifting hers. On returning, empty-handed, Andi found that a week’s unannounced time off had cost her the library job.Furious and disappointed, Andi might have spent a good deal of time tracking those idiots down. Instead, before sunrise the following morning, frantic news all over the city made her personal matters seem small: fighting had broken out where her brother was stationed, and war had begun."9/18/2017 10:12:56,Gunnolf,Human,Fighter,"-38Edrik is born in a distant country of Tollaug.  A mountainous region, Tollaug was somewhat insulated from the brunt of aftermath of the Awakening but not from frequent wars with its neighbors. By the time Edrik was born Tollaug was fighting with three of its four neighbors. The bitterest war was with the largest country on their border, Garstin, and that war had last for hundreds of years.  The Tollaugens had needed to adapt their culture to survive and defend their homeland.  Nearly every able adult became a warrior in the Tollaugen military and by necessity the state overtook the responsibility for rearing children ((sort of Viking-style spartans but with primitive guns)).  Thus Edrik never knew his parents.  He grew up with his peers in the capital city of Belstein, raised to fight in a war that seemed would never end.-26Edrik saw his first battlefield when he was 12.  Belstein was seized by Garstin forces and he watched from the ramparts with his peers as his kinsmen fought then opposing forces.  Eager to punish the invaders he dedicated himself to his martial training.  -28-19Though most recruits were not accepted into the military until they were 16, Edrik fought for and earned a position in their version of the assault infantry when he was still 14.  As one soldier in a battalion of hundreds he traveled over the mountains to fight on Garstin ground.  His notoriety grew within the unit, first due to his age and then due to the vicious efficiency with which he fought.  His only friends were the other members of his squad, though the brutality of the war meant he was frequently making new friends.  He earned their respect through his competence and willingness to keep them alive on the battlefield. By the time he was 17 he was made Captain of his squad.-19-10Eventually, Edrik's notoriety grew beyond his own battalion and he was reassigned to an experimental new unit: the Kitehawks.  Despite their military prowess, the Tollaugens were losing to the Garstin.  The Tollaugens had the larger military with better equipment, training, and officers but they had relatively few mages.  With their larger population the Garstin were able to embed mages regularly throughout their ranks and more than counter the advantage of the Tollaugens.  The mission of the Kitehawks was to infiltrate enemy territory before a battle and eliminate any prominent mages.Initially the team had six members:Sigmar - Commander, Dwarf Male Fighter/Rogue, a cunning old warrior who was equally adept at battle and planning strategies.  Sigmar recruited each member of the Kitehawks personally and exercised a lot of autonomy in how the unit was operated.  The Kitehawks essentially belonged to Sigmar. ((Hannibal from A-Team))Larin - XO, Half-Elf Female Rogue; a devious, clever spy who always seems to know what's going through someone else's head (and she might!), functions as the Kitehawk's intel officer ((probably a bit Garik-ish in that it's difficult to tell what side she's on sometimes))Enger - Male Human Barbarian; a giant man with a gregarious attitude ((Armstrong from FMA))Reivar - Male Human Ranger, a cunning woodsman and scout, a scary good sniper who used a custom built rifle to kill targets before he was ever seen. Known as ""Ghost"" by the enemy. ((Saito from GitS))Edrik - Male Human Fighter, a relatively young fighter who proved quick to pick up new skills. He was trained by each of the members of the team, becoming something of a jack-of-all-trades for the squad.Halin - Female Gnome Rogue, a cheerful gnome, Halin seldom took part in the actual fighting but functioned as the squad's support officer.  She developed most of the custom equipment they used and arranged their transportation (often with a good deal of creativity) ((Prolly like that fellow in F4 Railroad))Other members occasionally joined, died, or were reassigned but the team never numbered more than 9 and the 6 remained its core.  Edrik spent much of his time training with his teammates.  From Sigmar he learned battlefield tactics. From Enger he learned how to build his strength and hone his body. From Reivar he learned how to survive in nearly any environment.  Halin taught him much about their equipment and together the two of them constructed Hrunting, then a prototype.  But he may have learned most from Larin who taught him how to move without being seen.  Edrik grew very close to his teammates over the years and may have had a more than strictly professional relationship with Larin.The squad itself was such a success that they, almost single-handedly, changed the scope of the war.  On a typical mission, Edrik and Larin would infiltrate the enemy's camp while Sigmar, Halin and Reivar observed from a distance, providing field support through ""comm MIs"".  Enger with his large size, was kept in reserve.  If a distraction was required or something went wrong, Enger and Sigmar could swoop in while Reivar raised some chaos from a distance.Soon they were targeting more than just mages, taking out enemy commanders and officers as well.  Most often they would remove the corpse, or any other sign they had ever been there and leave the Garstin forces to wonder where their General or mage had disappeared to.  Sometimes they mutilated the corpse and prominently displayed it.  The Garstin tried many tactics, decoys, deployments, guards, but it seldom took the Kitehawks long to foil them.  When they began extracting high value targets, rather than killing them, the Tollaugens suddenly had a wealth of intel on their enemy.  The tide of the war began to swing and the Tollaugens took back territory they'd lost long ago and they swept into Garstin like a cutlass swings for a bare throat.-10Eventually the Tollaugens had fought right up to the Garstin capitol, Erba.  With the bulk of the Garstin military in ruins behind them their victory seemed assured.  The Kitehawks were sent in to capture the Garstin King, their most dangerous mission to date.  This time they all went into the field, taking different routes to meet up in the castle itself.  They fought/snuck to the King's chambers and found he was already dead, shot from a far through a window.It was then, in the sanctity of the King's chambers, that Sigmar revealed his ultimate plan.  He had determined that Tollaug couldn't hold onto Garstin, the other country was just too large.  Whether they conquered Garstin or were conquered by Garstin their culture and people would be assimilated into the larger country.  What's more, Tollaug had been at war for so long that it had forgotten how to be at peace.  With the resources of Garstin they would be able to crush their other neighbors and would soon lose their own identity.  Sigmar's plan was to manipulate the political field, to make it seem as though the Garstin King were still alive and commanding the army but in order for his plan to work he would need to destroy most of the Tollaug army outside the city.Hallig was the first to protest, arguing that even if Sigmar might be correct they couldn't kill their own countrymen.  The argument went back and forth for a few moments before Sigmar shot her.  At that point Edrick moved to draw his own pistol but a move from Larin stopped him.  Realizing he'd have to fight his own squad if he stayed, he grabbed Hallig's body (perhaps not realizing she was dead) and dove out the window.  He felt a bullet bite into his shoulder half-way to a river hundreds of feet below the castle keep.  He lost consciousness before he even hit the water.When he woke up Hallig was nowhere to be seen.  The river had carried him far from the city and deposited him on a distant bank.  From where he sat he could see smoke and flame in the distance and the river around him had a distinct reddish hue.  It almost looked black in the morning light.  He had been shot in the back of his shoulder but his armor had kept him from bleeding out, barely.  He was too weak to search for Hallig and was forced to escape with whatever he happened to have on him.  He resolved that Edrick was killed in the fall and he would become someone else, abandoning his life to that day.He never learned what became of the Kitehawks after that.  Sigmar's plan was complicated and Edrick never expected he'd heard all of it.  Explosions, either from magic or some hidden chemicals, destroyed 2/3s of the Tollaug army just as they broke the walls of the city.  The remainder fled back towards Tollaug but they were caught by the remains of the Garstin army.  Very few of those troops would ever return to their mountainous home.  Within the next few years Tollaug would be invaded again. They would repel that invasion, construct barricades, be invaded before the barricades were complete and according to myth an allegiance of the Garstin and the other enemies of the Tollaug were able to wipe them out. By -6 years the nation of Tollaug is no longer considered to exist.  -9From the banks of a river in Garstin, he wandered without much purpose.  He turned his back to Tollaug and just kept walking south.  He found his way to a northernish forest ((similar to Pac NW maybe)) and began to live as a wildman.  The events in Erba had left him shattered, a wreck of his former self.  His body recovered in time but he had simultaneously lost every purpose he had.  Only his training and an inability to give up kept him going.  He reasoned he could live out the rest of his life in this remote place and never see another person.By circumstance the cabin he built was close to a wolf's den.  He ran into the shaggy grey wolves from time to time but after their initial introduction they left each other alone.  The unspoken agreement was that he wouldn't interfere with the wolf or his bitch and they wouldn't try to eat his face.  That didn't stop the bitch's cubs from tromping through his cabin once they started leaving the den but he let them do as they would.Months later a clan of trolls moved into their valley.  He came back to the cabin to find the wolf, wounded and bloody.  He followed it's trail to find a troll squatting by the wolf's den, eating the last of the cubs.  Enraged, he attacked the troll, calling on skills and training he hadn't used for a year.  When the troll's corpse smoldered next to the den he lit his own cabin, tossed the wolf over his shoulders, and moved on.He nursed the wolf back to health since it seemed like the decent thing to do.  There after the wolf followed him, perhaps not quite a friend but a companion.  The wolf's wounds left it too weakened to survive on its own but he was content to provide it food in exchange for the company.-8The man and wolf seldom stayed in one place for terribly long.  It seemed everywhere they went there was something trying to eat them.  They didn't wish for much, just a place to live in solitude.  They avoided cities and people, keeping to the wild.So it was a perhaps a surprise when the man found himself waking in a cage.  A box of iron bars, large and strong enough to hold an ogre, encased him and beyond it was an ornate chamber.  Walls decorated with art and trickling water forming delicate pools among polished stones.  Lush plants lined the room, leading the eye towards a great desk at the far side of the room where a young man sat.  At least, he seemed young and quite handsome.  His features made it difficult to discern if he were human or elf, probably a mingling of the two, but he exuded charisma and confidence.  His name was Kolan and he was a prominent officer within the Order of Scales; a quasi-religious institution outwardly dedicated to maintaining the balance in the world. The organization's roots lay somewhere beyond the Awakening but, like most things about them, were shrouded in mystery.  Kolan explained that they had preferred to guide civilization through subtlety but that they had had to change with the times.  They were now a global organization that, on the face of things, might seem like another religion with interests in trade.  In the shadows they did much more than pray and broker politics.  Kolan explained that he was recruiting him to hunt down a particular woman, a sorcerer who had once been a member of the Order.  Kolan suggested he was familiar with the Kitehawks and could contact them if so inclined.  He could arrange a reunion or assassination, whichever was more likely to motivate his captive.  So the man was coerced into adopting the identity of Gunnolf, a roaming bounty hunter specializing in retrieving, or eliminating, mages.Once he had accepted this he was sent to a gnome named Zevan, another agent of the Order.  Zevan marked the back of Gunnolf's back hand with a symbol that would only appear under a magical lamp.  This would serve to mark Gunnolf as an agent of the Order to members of the Order but would otherwise be invisible.  Zevan equipped him as well, with armor and various magical items of some considerable worth.  Gunnolf learned that Zevan would be his handler and support officer, supplying him with information and equipment when he was undertaking missions directly for the Order.  Most of the time he would be undertaking public bounties and keeping an eye out for the sorceress.  And that's how a kid from a government school on the northern edge of the globe came to be a world-class bounty hunter of mage-types."9/18/2017 12:33:38,Severus Trevelyan,Human,Warlock,"The fading light of day cast elongated shadows across the city of Monarchia, the towers of brass reflecting the crimson red sun of dusk. There was a silent breeze drifting in from the north, causing Severus' cloak to flutter in the still air. He was standing upon the balcony atop the Senate building. It was a large oval building of marble, held up by columns of rune-inscribed white stone, which towered over the rest of the city. Severus was enjoying the spectacular view granted by the vista. He was clad in the traditional robes of the monarchian nobility, a pristine cloth coloured light blue trimmed with purple around the neck area. His back was covered in the cloak that was as dark crimson as the sky he was looking at.He turned and walked to the opposite side of the balcony which offered a different, if not as beautiful, view.Below him, he could see the senate floor where the hundred or so heads of nobility sat in discussion over the intricacies of tax collection. Occasionally a senator would rise from his seat and give a small speech on his opinion of the subject before sitting down to the applause of his supporters and the booing of his rivals. Nothing really changed until the final vote would be called, which would be at least another hour of tedious discussion by Severus' estimation. He sighed.'Not the most interesting of sessions, is it?' asked a voice behind him. Severus turned and saw an older man in his fifties emerge from the stairs. He was wearing the same traditional clothing as Severus, although this had a golden trim down the middle of the robe, indicating an elected Senator. 'Ah, Senator Tullios.' he remarked. Severus smiled at the old politician, although he groaned inside. 'Always a pleasure. Please join me.' waving his hand to indicate the spot next to him. 'My father sends his thanks for your hospitality during his visit yesterday. He was very pleased that he expect your support during the next election.' said Severus as Tullios came to stand next to him, following his gaze down to the floor below.Tullios smiled. 'Ah, it was no trouble. My home has and will always be open to the Trevelyans.' He turned and looked at Severus. 'And how is the High Legate? I had expected to see him in session today.'Severus wanted to sigh, but he kept up his political correct facade and smiled. 'My father is well, thank you. He regrets that he could not attend session today, his duties as High Legate prevents him so. He is out in the field. You understand, I'm sure.'Tullios nodded. 'Ah, yes. The duties of high office, of course.' He said disappointed. 'I was hoping that he might propose a motion for me as a favour.''He did send Axios, however.' Severus cut in. 'My brother is a senator and has the full backing of my father and his supporters. Don't worry, Senator. We Trevelyans remember our friends.' He sighed slightly inwardly as he, yet again, quoted the old maxim. Severus never liked these political conversations. It was all promises, alliances, rivalries, and so it had been for the past three hundred years. One could never be upfront about anything, not even with those who you were publicly known to be friends with. Every relation was to be used as a tool to further ones own goals.Tullios looked relieved 'Ah, excellent. That settles my worries so.' He looked down into the crowd of senators. 'I hope you will not be offended if I take my leave, I believe your brother Axios and I, have something to discussion.'Severus smiled, the first genuine smile at the old man. 'No offense taken. I understand completely. Please, give him my regards.'Tullios vanished down the stairs soon after. Severus noticed that the sun had gone completely now and he stood alone on the light-less balcony. He flicked his wrist at the braziers around him, and fire began to consume them, providing a shadowed light. 'Bastard old goat.' he murmured.'You shouldn't speak of our friends in such a tone, Severus' said a soft voice behind him. He smiled and turned, recognizing the voice.'Elyria! Sister, it has been far too long.' he said as they embraced for a moment. 'How have your travels been? We didn't expect you home until next month.'She smiled. 'I got tired of the dreary weather down south. It was quaint for the first week but that novelty quickly wore off.''Please.' said Severus indicating the spot where Tullios had stood only a minute before. They looked down in the Senate where a small woman was making a surprising passionate speech about the importance of tax exemptions.'Same as always.' Elyria mumbled.'At least you have a chance to travel.' said Severus. 'If father has his way, it will be me in a couple of years who's down there making speeches.''If you want for adventure so much, just join the Skitarii, they can always use more men, and it is prestigeous.' she remarked'Yeah and that is the problem. With fathers influence, I'll be an officer in a day, in two months I'll be commanding a whole brigade, and back to the politics, now with soldiers at my back. Oh yes, that would please him.' Severus said sarcastically.He sighed and leaned on the stone railing. 'No.. I need to leave Monarchia.' he stated with conviction.They were quiet for a while, simply watching the proceedings below. Even the Archon himself looked bored at the whole thing.Severus noticed that Elyria was biting her lower lip, a tic she usually had when she was thinking. 'I may be able to help you, Severus.' She finally uttered.He looked at her curiously, waiting for her to elaborate.'I came home early, not just because of the weather, but because I was asked to.. find somebody in Monarchia who would be willing to serve a greater purpose. I honestly doubted I'd find such a character in our Monarchia, but neither was I thinking of you.' she explained. Severus was about to speak, but she continued. 'This is not something you should take lightly, this is dangerous work. This.. might kill you if you're not careful.'She had a concerned look on her face. Severus knew her well enough to know that she rarely wore that particular expression.'What have you gotten yourself into, Elyria?' he asked plainly. 'I can't say.' she said. 'But I need to know if you truely want this. Tell me you want the job, and I'll make sure you get it.'Severus paced back and forth, weighting his options. Elyria continued to watch the exchange in the Senate, almost ignorant of his dilemma.He finally stopped, standing at his regular spot again besides Elyria. His voice dropped to a whisper. 'And what about.. Him?' He asked quietly. Elyria looked up. 'What about Him?' she asked.'Don't be coy.' Severus said, clearly annoyed. 'You know as well as I that we are bound to.. Him.'He had almost said it's name out loud. He fortunately had been able to hold his tongue, one does not utter the name of Ka'bantha without consequence. All the children of the Trevelyan family was bound to that creature when they turned 16. It was a family secret, one even not the closest friends of the family knew of. It was how the Trevelyans had risen to nobility some three-hundred years ago. Magical power was everything to the nobility of Monarchia, and the entire Senate below them were Wizards, Sorcerers and users of more exotic magics. Mages of all kinds were represented.Elyria smiled. 'Don't worry about Him, Severus. He is too busy with the schemes of the Nine Hells politics himself.' She shot him a glare. 'Just don't mention Him to anyone outside of Monarchia, they care as little for pacts with Devils as the narrow-minded fools down there.' she motioned to the floor below them.Severus nodded. 'I need time to think on this.' he stated. 'Can we meet tomorrow? Perhaps for breakfast?''Certainly.' replyed Elyria. 'I will see you tomorrow then, Severus.''Yes. See you there.' he said absent-minded and walked down the stairs, home to the family villa.The next morning Severus strode into the atrium of the Trevelyan villa. It was a large open space, with a view to the clear sky where the morning sun was shining brightly. The servants bowed as he took place at the table sitting at the centre of the atrium, they quickly rushed out with plates filled with fruit, meats and breads. He poured himself a glass of wine and took a quiet sip. It was rather warm, likely having been left on the table since the last meal.If he desired he could have one of the servants whipped for that, but he remained silent and simply cooled the wine he was holding with a thought before taking  another sip. It was perfect temperature.'You're up late.' said Elyria as she entered the atrium from the foyer.'I've had a lot on my mind.' he said, sipping the wine, savoring the flavour as it touched his tongue and rolled around in his mouth before swallowing.He looked up at her as she took a seat and poured a glass for herself. 'I need to know more about this purpose you're suggesting.'Elyria sat the jug of wine down. 'Leave us.' she said to no one in particular as she snapped her fingers. Within moments the servants had left the atrium. She leaned forward and looked Severus in the eyes. 'I can't tell you much. But what I can say is that you'll likely be working with a team of people to find and investigate magical disturbances. That's all I can say.'Severus scuffed 'Why do they need me for that? Don't they have Wizards of their own?' he said mockingly.Elyria shot him a glare. 'You forget that outside of Monarchia, magicians are more rare than they are here. Their nobilities are not made up of mages like they are here.' she explained.'Hm, maybe there's less arguing in the courts then.' he smiled.'No, unfortunately there is just as much arguing there as in Monarchia.' She looked around. 'I've been asked by the Archon to attend the court in Forlos. I can take you with me and let you off in the capital, or maybe even one of the smaller towns on the way. It'll be no trouble.'Severus thought about it for a long moment, before finally relenting. 'Very well, I shall accompany you to Forlos.' he paused. 'And see what this job you have for me is.'Elyria clapped her hands in excitement. 'Excellent! I'll make preparations immediately. We should be able to leave in a few days, I'll send word.'They both looked up as footsteps approached from the foyer, until Axios stepped into the atrium.'Ah, Good morning you two.' he exclaimed as he took a seat at the head of the table. He looked around for a moment. 'Where has all the servants gone? Am I suppose to pour my own wine?'They all laughed at the joke. 'It wouldn't hurt with some humility once in a while, brother.' said Severus as Elyria snapped her fingers at a much louder volume that should have been naturally possible. Moments later, the servants hurried back into the atrium to attend them.'Oh, I'm sure you're humble enough for both of us, Severus.' he said with a smile. 'Just as you have twice the ambition of the rest of us.' Severus retortedThey laughed again.Elyria spoke up after a moments of silence. 'I was just telling Severus that the Archon had requested that I attend court in Forlos.'Axios eyes focused on her. 'Indeed? Forlos.. that is rather far away isn't it?' he said thoughtfully. Elyria nodded 'About two weeks travel with carriage. I've been there once before. A novel people, if rather..' She sighed 'Uncivilized.'Axios scoffed as if that was the most obvious thing in the world.'She also suggested that I accompany her.' said Severus. Axios gazed at him with a rather surprised look. 'I was unaware that you wanted to play ambassador.' he remarked. 'I could have made arrangements.' he drained the rest of his glass in a single motion. Moments later the glass was full again, filled by a servant without a request. Axios didn't seem to notice it had ever been empty.Severus held up a hand. 'No no, it's quite alright. I'd rather see the people without having the duties of an ambassador hanging over my head. That was I may observe the proceedings with a clear mind.'Axios winked at him. 'Ahh I get it.' he said, likely without getting it.'We'll be leaving at the end of the week.' said Elyria 'Sadly the Archon said that this was rather urgent.'Axios looked at Severus. 'I know you don't have any proper traveling clothes. We shall have to call the armourer and have him fashion the finest armour for you, Severus.' he proclaimed loudly. Severus was less than enthusiastic. 'That won't be necessary, Axios. Just some plain leather will do me fine. I don't want to outshine the entire court.'Axios laughed 'Non-sense, I insist!' that seemed to be the end of the discussion.Three days later, Severus and Elyria was standing at the edge of the city in front of the city gates. The walls themselves surrounded Monarchia, with the nobilities villa having been built close to the Senate itself, with a marked district in the outer areas. The plebian population was mostly living outside the city-wall where a they were another city onto itself.The carriage that was to bring them to Forlos was rather plain. Severus approved. There were also four Skitarii guard which would escort Elyria on her official visit to Forlos.He looked at himself, in the armour that Axios had commissioned for him. He had been happy when he had seen it, for it was much more plain than he had expected from Axios. It was excellent quality, created to his exact dimensions, but lacking much of the decoration that Axios himself would have demanded.The only exception to this was the family crest which was embroidered onto the chest-piece of the armor: a fiery phoenix embracing a book.'I listen to you more than you give me credit for.' said Axios with a smirk on his face. 'It would appear so.' said Severus before smiling at his brother. 'Thanks, Axios.'      'Don't mention it.' he said, extending his arm. Severus grasped it, holding his brother in a strong grip at the wrist, as his brother did the same. 'March with fortune.' they both said at once and broke the grip. 'Tell father, I'm sorry I couldn't say goodbye.' Severus said. Axios merely nodded.Axios and Elyria made their own goodbyes as Severus climbed into the carriage. He sighed heavily, filled with an excitement that he could barely contain and nervousness.Elyria climbed inside soon after. 'You can strike that grin off your face, I'm not looking at that for two week.'When they reached the edge of the city-limited, Elyria fished out a letter from the satchel she was carrying and handed it to Severus. It was sealed in wax with her personal heraldry, a slight variation of his own fiery phoenix and book motif, as the stamp. 'Keep that close to you.' she said. 'It will be your entrance into the order when we arrive.' Severus raised an eyebrow at a mention of ""the order"" but from the fact that Elyria now seemed to ignore that any conversation took place, he merely smiled and put the letter in his own satchel bag."9/18/2017 9:52:52,The Exile,Human ,Paladin ,"The Exile was born into a small clan in the far north. He was raised to be a retainer in his lord's house. As a young retainer, his lord was attacked by a monstrosity. He shied away from fear and allowed his lord to perish. For that, he was banished from his homeland, never to return. Nine years have passed. He has wandered Fae-run looking for purpose. As he rests one night, he has a vision from the goddess, Selune, to go to Waterdeep and redeem his honor. Now, he journeys with a purpose and a calling: to defend all the free peoples of Fae-run. "9/18/2017 12:17:15,Shivers,Human (variant),Monk - Drunken Master,"Born in Farview in the Moonshae Isles, Caul comes from a family of sailors and merchants. He worked on his family’s ship throughout his childhood and teen years and is very comfortable on the sea. When he was 15 his family’s ship was attacked by pirates and most of the crew and his family was put to the sword…he escaped with his life because he was knocked unconscious by a sword blow to his head (causing a scar and seemingly dead eye). He awoke shivering in the cold water, floating on the debris of his family’s ship, and was discovered by a member of the Order of the Flagon. The Order of the Flagon is a monastic order that resides at the Iron Keep, a small former military stronghold on Omans Isle. Scale, the monk who rescued him, gave Caul the name Shivers because of how he was found. The Order of the Flagon is comprised of ex-military and sailors who have tired of their former lives and seek deeper meaning to their existence. At the Iron Keep the monks focus on a number of things: training their minds and bodies to be weapons, harnessing potential innate magical abilities, assisting all those who may need it, maintaining a proper sense of humor about most things (they consider that the only appropriate response to the randomness of the world), and brewing ale so good that a sip may help you see the workings of the universe…they tend to drink their brew pretty heavily. During his years there, Caul discovered an affinity for martial arts, both empty-handed and with a quarterstaff, as well as some innate druid magical ability; he also became the assistant brewer for the order by the time he was 20.The tradition of the Order dictates that individual members go forth into the world for at least 2 years in order to enhance their fighting training, help those who need it, and to research ingredients and techniques to experiment with new beer recipes and styles. Caul left the order at the age of 24 and has now been traveling the Sword Coast for one year. He is currently in Waterdeep working as a bouncer at a popular waterfront tavern and brewery called the Besotted Beholder and experimenting with their brew system whenever he gets a chance. Caul carries a long carved ironwood mash paddle that he uses as a quarterstaff when fighting. It is carved down from an oar that he was clutching after the his family's ship was destroyed. It is reinforced with iron strips along the sides and wrapped in leather at several points."9/17/2017 23:36:28,Jango Dongsworth,Human Male,Tailor,"Young Jango Dongsworth was tailor before to the Duke before he was found mysteriously murdered, garroted with a tailor's measuring tape and stabbed with a pair of tailoring scissors.

Lander, Captain of the City Guard; her husband and father to their 10-year-old son, Valen, was killed in the attack. As the Orc Lord's raiders ransacked the town, Rhalia hid Valen away in their home before being captured and taken prisoner to be used as a slave in Laerhaven's dungeons. Using a warlock's powers, she, and the rest of the slaves, were kept under control. If one tried to escape, a location spell would easily track them down and punishment would be severe.As time went on in the dungeons, Rhalia became hardened by her mistreatment. She spent her time studying the filth and scum that inhabited the city of Laerhaven. A thief and charlatan named Jakobi was also imprisoned after trying to cheat a trader in town. Rhalia grew close to him and learned many skills and tricks. They learned the nature of the spells and traps used to keep the slaves under control. They learned the limitations and extent of those as well.Her heart mourned for her home and family but Jakobi was a much needed helping hand. Soon she became pregnant. She knew that there would be no chance of survival for her child should she be discovered. She feigned injuries and illnesses- just enough to keep her from working but not to be considered useless- to keep her pregnancy secret. The orcs were ruthless but they were not that smart. On the final night of her pregnancy, Jakobi did the unthinkable for her. He attempted an escape in order to distract the guards long enough from the cries of the child being born; and to buy Rhalia enough time to smuggle her away from the city.Rhalia had connections outside the city walls. An entity known only as ""Grandmother Night"" had kept her and Jakobi supplied with tools and food while they were imprisoned. A troupe of travling lightfoot halflings was dispatched to help smuggle a package out of Laerhaven's dungeons. The package they received was not the one they were expecting. It was an infant girl named Joy Beestinger. As Rhalia watched her daughter taken away to safety, she turned and ran back towards Jakobi's planned escape route. She arrived in time to see Jakobi on his knees, captured by the barbaric guards. She watched in horror as he turned to her and winked just as a sword was plunged into his chest. She knew not to scream. She only cried.Years passed and finally, it was time. Under the cover of darkness, Rhalia led a small group of slaves through the sewers but not towards the outside walls. They emerged in the basement of Laerhaven's fortified hall. They slaughtered the bodyguards in silence. They butchered the warlock in his sleep. Only the Orc Lord remained. Rhalia would slice his throat herself. She was cold and unfeeling as the life seeped from the wound and onto the filthy sheets of the giant bed. The Orc Lord was no more. They were slaves, no more.""Mother. Forgive me. You raised me better than this."" She muttered as a small figure met her outside the town walls. The smell of baked goods and honey met her nostrils.""Nonsense, child."" The halfling woman stepped into the moonlight. ""I raised you to fight for what you believe in and do what is right. The same things you taught your own child, whom you should see, by the way. He's so handsome!""""Valen is alive?!"" Rhalia's knees buckled and she fell in front of her mother. ""But.. I had not thought of him- I didn't believe he could be.."" Her mother's small hand on her shoulder steadied her.""Alive and well. As is.. Joey?"" She added.""Joey?"" Rhalia looked puzzled for a second but smiled again as tears streamed down her face. ""Joy. Her name is Joy. My Joy."" She closed her eyes and remembered the words of Jakobi. (""You are my joy."")""Go to them, my dear sweet child.""""Yes, mama."" Rhalia breathed in her first deep breath of freedom in very long. ""I will go to my children. Thank you for everything, mama. I love you.""""I love you, too."" Said the small woman, holding a staff out for Rhalia to take. ""You'll need this."" She smiled. ""Oh! And these. You look hungry, dear, eat before you set out."" She handed Rhalia a sweet-smelling bundle wrapped in an elegant kerchief and with that, seemed to disappear into the shadows.Rhalia smiled and sighed as she looked up to the heavens. She would need money to travel.. and armor.. and more weapons. She knew just where to go."9/18/2017 19:17:59,Tulip the Mad,Hungerseed Tiefling,Cleric,"Tulip has spent most of her life in the care of a mental institution. She was discovered amongst a number of ill-treated prisoners in ragged clothing kept hostage by a group of insane cultists of the Great Old Ones some years ago.On the surface she seems to be child-like, her way of speaking and mannerisms playful and whimsical, talking of playmates, friends, tea parties, candies, cakes, cute puppies and kittens, that sort of thing.Over the past several years, however, her once placid and innocent behavior has descended into greater and greater violence. While once it may have been that her imaginary friends were just that, imaginary, it seems that the stars have aligned and something dark whispers to Tulip.""Tea party"" seems to equivocate to severe violence perpetrated by the tea party hosts upon the guests, who are then sent to ""The Grandest Tea Party of Them all,"" whatever that is.She was discovered living quite happily amongst the corpses of the two dozen or so patients and six staff, covered in blood, drawing dark and arcane sigils on the walls, amidst drawings of the happy and pleasant things her speech is often peppered with.The bodies revealed that they did not died pleasantly, set upon and partially devoured by beasts with claws and fangs. Tulip was certainly not responsible for this, instead somehow managing to summon vile creatures into being. The only one left behind was an animated skeleton Tulip dubbed ""Mr. Buttons,"" who she made herself.One of her imaginary friends, whom she calls the Lady in Shade, told her that she was meant to be a princess. Tulip decided that as a princess, she needed a butler. So she made one.Obviously mentally ill, Tulip was then placed in far stricter and more controlled medical care. Pages upon pages are devoted to conversions between Tulip and her primary care doctor and read as a descent from a good and noble doctor into a mad lunatic seeking to curry favor from dark powers from beyond time and space.Tulip, apparently, had learned how to spread her warped state of mind at a touch. Once again she was discovered happily amongst a massacre, quite contently having dinner, dressed in a ball gown, being doted on by her followers amidst the patients and staff who had turned fearsome cultists who regarded her as a gateway of power and insight from their new dark masters.Tulip was exorcised, a dark spirit that amplified her power driven from her. That did not, however, prevent her from once again murdering a careless guard and recreating Mr. Buttons.No longer thought of as merely mentally ill, Tulip has been sentenced to death for her part in the blasphemous murder and ritualistic sacrifice of the staff and patients of the hospice that did not come under sway of the cult.She doesn't quite seem to understand her fate. She insists that she be given her dress back, as she has a ball to attend. She is a princess, and she is finding this time out very inconvenient. And also boring. She's also lost her puppy, he flies, you know."9/18/2017 11:42:22,Ayomide,Ifrit,Skald,"DYNAMIC ENTRY they're a warrior bard.

A girl from the southern lands (Read: Australia) who was travelling with her merchant father came across the young ifrit and they became good friends, and her father eventually decided to adopt him. The girl, Emily, gave him the human name Dave after her grandfather David who had recently passed. When the three returned home, the girl's mother did not like Dave being a part of the family, and made life miserable for him. Many years later, after the mother had passed, and the father reached an advanced age, he bought a parting gift for Dave and Emily as he knew he would not be long for this world. The gift was a wolf, who the pair named Luna, and she was to protect them and comfort them in the years to come. One night, the father passed of an illness. Dave and Emily wept, and eventually fell asleep in each other's arms. Dave was awoken by Luna's howls, and found that Emily had gone missing. There was no immediate sign of a struggle, but none of her belongings had been taken nor had she left a note to explain her absence. With Luna by his side, Dave left on a mission to recover his friend and sister, vowing not to rest until she was returned safe. It was on this mission that he stumbled across a tavern, filled with an unlikely band of heroes, including (among others) a drow, a bear and a priest who was having an animated conversation about candles.

The reluctant adventurers made their way to Khorvaire traveling up the Dagger River to Breland.  Sometime after landing in the Breland capital, Wroat, Galadir and Gideon had suffered a philosophical disagreement leading the former to remain in Wroat while the latter journeyed north toward Aundair.  While Breland and Aundair were not in open war, circumstances prevented the two from communicating frequently.  Gideon and Galadir were never forced to face one another on the battlefield.In contrast to his commanding brother, Gideon is quiet and unassuming preferring thought to words and careful planning to quick action. Gideon was serving as a cleric in a shrine to Arawai at Passage when a summons came from Queen Aurala ir'Wynarn.

While Breland and Aundair were not in open war, circumstances prevented the two from communicating frequently.  Galadir and Gideon were never forced to face one another on the battlefield.In contrast to his thoughtful brother Gideon, Galadir often uses his physical prowess and force of will to the advantage of intimidation.  A flashy smile and air of importance generally comprise his countenance.  King Boranel quickly recognized the ease with which Galadir handled everyday Wroat and enlisted him as a officer among the Paladins in his service.  Though changing hands numerous times previously, under Galadir's eye Cragwar remained controlled by Breland for the signing of the Treaty of Thronehold and away from Aundair and Thrane.  "9/18/2017 4:41:43,Kosef Stefanov,Karsite,Knight,"Fodel Stefanov, Kosef’s father, was a simple wheat farmer living just outside Tantras with his half-elf wife, Jhessail, until the 13th of Eleasis.  In the Year of Shadows when Torm chose Tantras as his home among mortals, Bane led an army to destroy the city and steal something precious from the god of duty.  To protect their only son, both parents gave themselves to Torm that day.  Kosef’s only other living relative in the city at the time was Sergor Stefanov, his grandfather, but he had disappeared a week earlier… along with many others who worshipped gods other than Torm.  Dorn Greywood, Jhessail’s father and Kosef’s grandfather, is a retired merchant who did well for himself.  Now residing in Harrowdale Town, Dorn prefers his solitude.  Over twenty years ago his elven wife, Imizael Eveningfall, left him when she followed the elves of Cormanthor in the Retreat.  Dorn spends most of his time smoking his pipe and contemplating Imizael’s reasons, sure that if he could understand them perfectly he would know what he should have done to keep her from leaving.  In his youth, Dorn traveled the Dales and nearby regions both on business and as an amateur adventurer dabbling in magic.  This was before he picked up the regular route that took him through Tantras, which is how he befriended Fodel and how Fodel came to marry his daughter.  Jhessail’s life had been so awkward up to that point that Dorn was happy to see her wed to a good man who would care for her.  Stefan, Kosef’s great grandfather from whom the family took its name, was a great warrior and is a renowned folk hero in Kosef’s hometown.  The locals attribute a great many battles and victories to Stefan, and at least one of them is true: Stefan single-handedly turned back a Drow raid bent on razing the town.  One of his neighbors even commemorated the battle in song (see below).  Stefan renounced his familial ties to the Xinleal family when they embraced the Zhentarim, but he could not bring himself to destroy the truth.  Because of this he pens a book, The Ancestry of Xinleal, detailing his family’s history as far back as Brennus Xinleal and his origins in the ruins of Hlondath.  No living Xinleal or Stefanov knows their heritage extends back to Karsus of Netheril, as it was purposely forgotten after the fall.  The Xinleal family of Zhentil Keep, a family whose traditional service to the Keep’s military over the past seven hundred years, are Kosef’s cousins who exiled Stefan over seventy years ago to prove their loyalty to the Zhentarim.  Unquestionably loyal and holding prestigious positions in the Zhentarim, the Xinleals fell to worshipping the God of Strife after Stefan’s exile.  With Bane’s death and the rise of Cyric, the Xinleals followed Fzoul Chembryl’s example in paying lip service to the new god despite their distaste for him.  During Cyric’s madness, the Xinleal family predicted the catastrophe in Zhentil Keep and relocating to the Citadel of the Raven, which now serves as headquarters to the Zhentarim.  When Iyachtu Xvim emerged from the rubble of Zhentil Keep the Xinleal family gladly dedicated themselves to the Baneson’s service as did their role model, Fzoul Chembryl.  The Xinleal family dedicated a portion of their resources to the reconstruction of Zhentil Keep and a portion of the family continues its residence in the Keep if for no other reason than to avoid breaking a tradition of over 700 years of residence in Zhentil Keep.The Stefanov family has kept secret their familial connection to the Zhentarim for over three generations.  No Stefanov in that time would choose such an allegiance, and none would have wished their family name slandered with mention of such a connection.  Kosef is still oblivious to this, as he never read The Ancestry of Xinleal.An even older secret is the Stefanov family’s heritage which dates back all the way to Karsus of Netheril.  The Xinleals (whom the Stefanovs trace their heritage to) felt shamed by their relation to Karsus and concealed it just as the Stefanovs now conceal their relation to the Xinleals.Kosef is a devout follower of Torm, having been raised in the faith by his father who also believed.  His mother, while not claiming Torm as her patron, had a strong sense of duty concerning her family and was supportive of her son’s choice of worship.  Additionally, seeing the god of Duty die in the name of his duty to protect the city of Tantras cemented Kosef’s belief that Torm was the most noble and honorable of the gods.  Kosef gladly devotes himself to the duties of his faith, knowing it is worth it.  In addition to his patron Torm, there are several deities to whom Kosef offers prayers to more frequently than others.  First among these is the Lady of Strategy, the demigod Red Knight, whom he prays to for guidance in all things related to strategy.  This does not mean Kosef neglects praying to Torm for guidance, as he does that regularly when deciding upon a course of action.  However, once that course is set his prayers to the Red Knight help him plan how to achieve his chosen path.  In short, he prays to Torm to answer “what” and to the Red Knight to answer “how.”Kosef also prays to Tyr when hoping for justice to prevail, when acting to punish the guilty, or for matters concerning the law.  Although in many of these circumstances he will still pray to his patron first, or sometimes both.  Lastly, Kosef prays to Mielikki in memory of his mother who also worshipped the Forest Queen.  Jhessail imparted in her son a deep love of and respect for nature, and seeing it abused angers him."9/18/2017 11:04:21,Srimp the fearless,Kender,Rogue/mage,"Even though most lender never have the patients for magic shrimp took to it like other lender did the famous wanderlust all lender are afflicted with.

Sent out into the world to spread the teachings of his order, he joined a group of adventurers and accompanied them across the frozen wastes of the Crown of the World, a mountainous arctic continent. On these adventures, Kebosh got into much trouble, ranging from vaporizing an evil demigod to  losing his arm and subsequently replacing it with an ancient and powerful prosthetic.After saving the continent (and potentially the world) Kebosh retired to establish his own monastery on the continent, where he lived out the rest of his days teaching others and attempting to bring other typically ""evil"" monsters into the light, in the same way he had been."9/18/2017 10:09:19,Flavius Ignatious Pike,Kobold,Sorcerer,"Flavius Ignatious Pike is a funny little white scaled Kobold of roguish tendencies. He stands about 2'6"" and weighs 40 lbs., but talking to him you'd think you were talking to a dragon of at least human size. Now, Pike (which is what all of his friends call him) is an odd Kobold to say the least. He was barely a hatchling when an adventuring party wiped out his home den and set him adrift in the surface world. Lonely, tiny, half blind, and desperate, Pike somehow found his way into the lair of an Ancient Silver Dragon, Shamalundith, and her mate, Koriasith. Taking pity on the tiny creature, Shamalundith took him in and raised him as if he were a hatchling, and now, Pike fully believes himself to be a silver dragon. He would often wander into the nearby town, keeping low and to the sides, just to examine the melting pot of creatures and to sate his natural curiosity. He discovered his draconic blood around the age of 4, and began practicing the art of sorcery with the help of Shamalundith, and even though his draconic blood wasn't inherently Silver, he was so disheartned and confused that Shamalundith and Koriasith wove a spell to alter it. He is now a proficient burglar and fledgling sorcerer, much to the chagrin of Shamalundith, and he gives his all in an attempt to build his own little hoard. Shamalundith has been a huge impact in his life, teaching him how to control his magic, how be use a blade, how to survive, but most of all, how to respect life. On the 6th anniversary of his appearance in her cave, Shamalundith gifted Pike with a set of adventuring gear sized for him and a magic bag to hold his little treasure hoard before sending him out into the world to carve his own destiny. He still often returns home to visit his mother and deposit what he has earned or stolen onto his ever growing little hoard.

Tall and strong, even among lizardfok, he was born a fighter, but surprisingly intelligent, despite his relatively savage appearance and nature, and is not one to shy away from the study and research of other subjects, like magic. He's found the world of soft-skinned mammals like humans to be a strange, alien one. Wondrous, but hard to comprehend at times. His ability to speak their common language leaves a bit to be desired, too, and though it's not bad, it hasn't helped him too much. He's turned rather silent and withdrawn.

Strass helped out by venturing into the woods and swamps to gather stock for the store shelves. Eventually, Strass' parents were made slaves in order to pay their mounting debts, and he was left to fend for himself.

One night while walking around the town I got jumped by a group of people who kicked the shit out of me and left me for dead in an alley.  Probably other monks, but I don't know who.  I woke up in the home of and old Elf woman (visibly old, so she's gotta be like 700) I had never met before.  She said nothing, but made for me a very simple looking soup (if it makes sense, we can say it was in a peculiar glass bowl).  It was, quite simply, the best dish I had ever eaten.  All five flavors worked in perfect harmony along with a 6th, distinct and unidentifiable flavor.  I gulped it down far too quickly, but before I could ask for another bowl, the woman had disappeared.  I stood up to look for her, but still weak and woozy from the beating, I fell back down and lost consciousness.  When I woke up I was at the foot of the restaurant.  I tried to tell the Head Chefs about my experience but they wouldn't believe me.  Since I can't shut up about a thing that I know I'm right about, I kept trying to convince them of what I found.  Eventually they had had enough of it and exiled me, flippantly saying that if I found this so-called 6th flavor and brought it back, they would let me into The Kitchen again.  I know they didn't really mean it, but I'm pretty sure if I actually did find it, then they would be forced to accept me.

Her parents are both hunters, and her three sisters are a healer, the tribe's lorekeeper, and a gatherer, respectively.Ora has been training in combat and hunting since she was old enough to hold a weapon and bait a trap, and she has put forth effort to assist her tribe as both a warrior and a hunter when needed. After a disastrously failed romance with another member of the tribe, the social politics of tribal living began to grate on her; at 120 years young Ora began taking to the wilderness for increasingly longer spans of time, returning only to the tribe to bring supplies and share a meal before departing again.

His parents only making ends meet, early life proved difficult, with no formal schooling he learnt what he knew from work and those around him. Through the joint struggle of those too poor to use magic to improve their lives, he gained a strong sense of community within the lower layer, valuing the small efforts people made for one another. From these people he learnt of the upper levels; rich folk who could use magic without any concern, with severe disdain for those below them. He saw plenty of abuse from upperclassmen, mostly with magic, mostly businesses being destroyed or people in his life abducted by those higher up. At the age of 14, Sigbar's father Nathaniel Bardrun was arrested under the suspicion of spontaneous magic use without a licence. No formal sentence was released, but his father was never returned. With one salary out of the picture, his mother turned to the church for charity to keep going; the church of Cayden Cailean. Through this help, Sigbar found himself another community within the church who would support him and he found Cayden's sense of justice and freedom rang true with his own. Most of all, both he and the church believed magic was personal and should be free, though the church begrudgingly pay tithe to the government to prevent any repercussions.Sigbar's vigor for his beliefs was noticed on a chance encounter with one of Cayden's fewest paladins; Aula Holyhands. With the head cheric's permission, Sigbar's name was placed forward and approved for paladin training, under Aula's tutorage. To protect his mother's identity, Sigbar took on the church's codename; Holyhands. Training included charity work around the city, martial training and devoutness to justice and freedom (only as far as the law allows).When the church is asked for a ""Militant"" to oppose the government, Aula's name was placed forward but refused by Aula. Instead, knowing Sigbar's feelings with his father's 10 year long disappearance, she put his name forward and Sigbar joined the rebellion, fighting for the freedom and jusice the people deserve under the command of the UnderGround Resistance, hoping his work will lead to answers about his father's whereabouts."9/18/2017 11:32:27,Ergo,Ogre,Fighter,"Ergo was a solitary Ogre, and not to happy with it.  He knew what others thought of him and his race.  Were they wrong? Absolutely not, ogres were big dumb brutes.  However, Ergo wanted to change that.  He decided he would learn how to use a complex weapon.  One that you couldn't just swing and hit.So, he hid in the tree line close to a human settlement.  Humans were simple, like ogres, and were always doing something.  Today children were playing in the training grounds, but Ergo thought they were training.  The young soldiers, Ergo thought, were using a strange spinning weapon that returned after being thrown.  This amazed him to the point of wanting to learn how to use it.Although, the humans would never teach him.  So he watched the children to learn how to throw this amazing weapon.  After sometime a child threw one improperly and it landed close to him in the trees.  Ergo grabbed the weapon and ran off to make an ogre sized one.  After many months of work and practice Ergo learned to use the weapon, however after it hit a target it would not comeback.  This angered him until he had an idea.  He would find someone to make him a special weapon, and he did just that.  He walked into a town with gems and other shiny things to trade for his weapon.  The weaponsmith was flabbergasted, but made the weapon with an enchantment that allowed it to return after hitting a target.Ergo then went on to become an Ogre of great renown.  He slew dragons and taught other ogres how to use the returning blade.  Why he even learned how to forge and enchant the weapon.  Today there is a clan of ogres that follow Ergo and claim him to be the Ogre God of Ogre Things.

Grok pushed the gang into a more aggressive campaign of bandit activity, ultimately slaying all the new player characters who had been intended to join his gang.  Ug, the stupidest member of the gang, provided hilarious antics during their depredations but was quite effective in combat.

The key difference is that the Burning Sun add the extraordinary caveat that strength must be used in protection of the weak. The weak must still know their place and serve the strong, but the relationship is reciprocal. Every Burning Sun Orc knows this and considers the defense of the weak to be a sacred duty.	Then there is Shegardis Darkcrusher, for whom duty has became an obsessive mania. Even with the Burning Sun barely holding their own against enemies on every side, Shegardis could not stand the idea that those same enemies oppressed scores of others beyond her reach and outside her protection. So she has set out across Belkzen's unforgiving wastes, interposing herself between the abused and their abusers wherever she finds them. Every beating she takes only makes her faith in Sarenrae stronger. Every battle she survives only reassures her she is on the right path. She doesn't know much, but she knows that strength is more than just hitting the hardest: it is being able to stand after the hardest hit lands on you. She has no illusions about her own survival, living this way. But that is the burden such strength brings.	As befits a paladin of the Dawnflower, Shegardis always gives her foes a chance to back down, if possible. Whether through parlay or intimidation, she wants her foes to know what they are up against. Since cowards never dare engage someone stronger than they, Shegardis is developing ways to make her foes come to her whether they will it or no. If she can live long enough to perfect these techniques, then the downtrodden of Belkzen will have a formidable defender indeed.	Shegardis would love to polish her armor to a brazen shine and brush her thick hair to its full luster. But she knows what Orcs respect and fear, and so she leaves the metal dark and bloodstained, rarely brushes the filthy mats from her hair, and dons the fierce warpaint of a Belkzen reaver. Whatever it takes to strike fear in the wicked and to present a face of brutal strength, she will do it. Doing what is right is not pleasant or beautiful, so as long as her work needs to be done she will not be pleasant or beautiful either."9/18/2017 15:51:06,Finn Stalin,Pale Oni,Samurai ,"Lived a normal life as a ""human"" then a group of adventures came by and Finn was kind enough to show them his town and church( The Church of the Red Star) and got help from the leader of the church Joseph(Finn's father).

In the end the group decided to confront Joseph on the spy, Finn wanted to follow his fathers wishes but he was also shaken by the spy and what happened to him. When they arrived at the church immediately the group started bombarding Joseph with question but Joseph said that he cannot elaborate on the spy nor did he wanted to talk about anything that may point that the church is evil. Finn fed up of all the arguing started questioning his father and started to scream at him, in the end it ended with Finn denouncing the religion he believed for so long. This broke Joseph heart, Joseph was now enraged and blamed the group for tainting his sons mind and branded them traitors for betraying his trust. Then one member attacked the Joseph, Finn and Joseph were shocked and then Joseph got mad. he pushed back his attack and said ""That's it you betray my trust, you turn my son against me, and now you attack me in this holy place!

""The sword itself is connected to me"" he thought ""when I sheathe the blade my true power in unleashed"" he then scowled ""I swear I will defeat the ones who took everything from me with this blade sheathed, with this form, MY FORM and If I cant defeat them only then will I use my full power so that if I may die at least I'll take out all of them and I'll be able to see my father again."" and with that vow he collect the rest of his stuff, buried his father and went out into the world to train and to get revenge on the ones who destroyed his way of life.

As Nirik came of age his skills in archery were known throughout the North. Providing food for the whole village and taking out any monsters who were causing trouble, Nirik made a name for himself. Eventually, his prowess with a bow provided the opportunity for him to serve as a personal guard for the chief. The highest rank a villager could achieve besides being cheif himself. However, Nirik came from a poor family and the noble villagers felt he had no right to serve the chief so closely. Hatred and jealousy made these naysayers go to Nirik's hut one night. Awakened by the screams of his mother, Nirik saw as these men slit her throat in front of him. Before the intruders could make another move, Nirik slaughtered them where they stood. Anger and the feeling of betrayal caused Nirik to pack all his things that night. After burying his mother, and putting the murderers heads on spikes, Nirik began south and never looked back.

She comes off as rather sardonic and uncaring, but truly, she is appreciative of the beauty of nature.  In fact, that's why she ended up adventuring in the first place.

As with many in the Order of the Timeless Plan, Nina was born into the life, schooled in matters both religious and worldly from a young age, and in matters more martial once she reached her teenaged years.Although she longed for a true test of her skills, Nina, befitting her status as a junior member, was mostly sent on supply runs, both to the nearby Rajashi, and occasionally to Lionguard for wares unavailable in the desert city. It was on one such supply run that word was sent to her of a nearby encampment of bandits, and as she was the nearest member of the Order in the area, she was instructed to reconnoiter their camp—and reconnoiter only, unless attacked or otherwise absolutely necessary.Unfortunately for her, an ill-timed sneeze gave away her presence, and she was swiftly captured. Rather than fight, however, she walked willingly with her captors into her cage, so that she could have time to formulate an escape plan, thankful that her simple garb seemed to have caused the bandits to take her for a common courier.After several days—and several plans thought up, mulled over, and discarded—a new variable entered the arena: Another adventurer. Many of the plans she had tossed out, she had done so precisely because they would have required a second person. Now, however, she could put one of them into action; She saw her chance, and she took it, and with the aid of the adventurer, she was free of her captivity. Out of gratitude—and also out of a desire for both a bit of action and a bit of revenge—she pledged to help the adventurers' group to destroy the bandit camp, though once the task was done, she set out to return to Stonehold.On the way there, however, she found the holy symbol of someone else in her order dangling from a bush, and followed a red light in the distance—one that led her right back where she came. Confused as h*ck, she decided the best course of action was to rejoin the group, see the world, and hope to send a message to Stonehold in the next few days."9/18/2017 11:11:09,Legate,Tabaxi,Rogue,"Abandoned at birth; turned into a (domesticated) Tabaxi; Has a strong sense of honor, so only steals from nobles and those he has fairly defeated."9/18/2017 9:59:32,Archer,Tabaxi,Rogue,"_ARCHER OF NEXALHe was always the black sheep of the large clan, stuck mostly to himself and indulged his odd hobbies-- reading, studying plants, and exploring the deep jungle. Doing so, he  gained a reputation as someone full of secrets, self-reliant, and brave. Thus, when the Nexal clan was threatened with a mysterious outbreak of untraceable nightly wolf attacks, the Tabaxi king Hutsin reached out to Archer to join his Secret Service as an undercover asset. Archer, being a curious guy without a clear purpose, accepted the offer and was trained in the spy arts; his mission: investigate the source of these attacks while keeping watch on Hutsin. One day, while debriefing the King on his surveillance of the clan, Archer was taken by surprise; a hooded figure, silent and fast, flung Archer aside and sunk a dagger into the King's throat and ran out of the private chamber. Archer, stunned, regained his senses as guards found Hutsin's body. A lifetime of sneakiness and secretiveness instantly made him the #1 suspect. And so Archer fought off the guards as they went to arrest him and Archer gave chase to the hooded figure that only he had seen. Leaving his home behind, Archer has been tracking this assassin for months, all the way into the Underdark. There, he was stalled by his capture. He's been trying to get back on track ever since. One day, he will be able to clear his name, locate the source of his clan's mysterious wolf scourge, and restore order to his home. "9/17/2017 23:07:04,Plume,Tabaxi,Monk,"Plume in the Wind is a 17-year-old Tabaxi, from the Fading Breeze Clan. Bursting with vibrant energy and endless curiosity, Plume grew up to be a very agitated and restless child. Their parents decided that they should follow the training of Sweet Zephyr, also known as Master Zeph', to become one of the monk soldiers who protect the Clan. Maybe Zephyr would manage to channel Plume's spiritedness into something useful and honorable!After two years of learning the monks' martial art techniques and philosophy, Plume began to get bored of the zen teachings. They enjoyed the exhausting fighting exercises and the straining activities to improve one's control over their body… But it wasn't worth all of the meditation, and contemplation, and deference, and self-reflection, and obedience, and *urgh*. There just wasn't enough action. The prospect of spending the next few decades staying in the same place, defending their clan against the same easily-defeated threats (orc clans and savage beasts, for the most part) was quickly becoming depressing.They wanted to be a bug. Like, a beautiful spider, or a tiny sandfly. They had always been fascinated by insects. Their ability to crawl or fly everywhere they wanted, while staying completely silent and unnoticed, was the most captivating thing ever. The quiet strength of ants or beetles, and the stubbornness they seemed to irradiate, was inspiring. They wanted to be able to scuttle like those bugs. Fast, and chaotic, and powerful, and swift, and focused, all at once.One day, they had enough of being disciplined in front of the other students for (again) not being able to keep still during the daily meditation session. They felt a small butterfly land on their ankle, so of course they opened their eyes to see what color it was and where it was going next! But apparently nobody understood how pretty and enchanting it was. Punishments, like trainings, were physically bearable — Plume was a strong, well-build Tabaxi — but Master Zeph' used only the most boring chores as punishments for Plume. This time wasn't particularly bad (Plume had sorted and washed kilograms of mushrooms before) but it was the last straw.So they put their stuff in a hastily-made bag, left a short note for Master Zeph' (« Thank you for your teachings. I don't think I can find my inner peace at the dojo, or ever be a satisfying Breeze Soldier. I wish you well. »), another for their parents (« I want to see what the bugs look like in other parts of the world. I'll probably come back to show you at some point. I love you. »), and they left in the direction the wind was blowing.They spent the next two years travelling around aimlessly, watching interesting bugs, hiding from ugly-looking creatures, running across plains at night and sleeping in trees during the day. They started earning a dime escorting merchants when they wanted to travel across inhospitable lands, and eventually ended up at Aldranos. They had expected to hate the city (villages were in general pretty boring: they always felt like the weird stranger, and the flies buzzing around farms and trash piles were much less interesting than the colorful insects they found in nature). Much to their surprise, they realized that they quite liked it. They weren't the only exotic race there, big buildings meant shadows everywhere, and there were plenty opportunity to get in all kinds of fun trouble.Running low on cash, they decided to answer a job posting for a security gig at some kind of party organized by an elven Lord. The place was super fancy, so it would probably be boring, but it paid well, and they got to wear a beautiful uniform, full of bright colors that made them look like a crossing between a dragonfly, a ladybug and a jaguar. Hopefully they could keep it afterwards!"9/18/2017 9:35:22,Ramal,Tabaxi ,Sorcerer,A disgraced member of a Merchant Priests Guild on a pilgrimage to find a Sacred Silver Coin of Waukeen.9/17/2017 21:49:02,Storie,Tabaxi (Catfolk) ,Pact of the Chain Warlock,"Storie was orphaned as a very young Tabaxi; abandoned in the human city of Unity. A pair of humans found her as she wandered alone, hungry and scared. This couple took Storie in and raised her as their own. Storie's parents owned a small item shop near Unity's center. From an early age Storie acted as a sort of scout, finding abandoned things or picking various herbs outside Unity's gates to be sold in the shop. As she grew older she was allowed to go further from home in these expeditions. During one such trip at age 16 Storie happened across a wounded animal while looking for a rare flower often used in dyes. She knew there was a small town nearby so she took the animal there in hopes that it's owner was among the residents. As she approached the gates she was accosted by another creature; this one small, capable of flight and shrilly chattering at her. It seemed angry. It was ADORABLE! Storie immediately decided that she needed to adopt one.While she sought out the wounded animal's owner she discovered that the ""adorable flying angry thing,"" as she described it, was a pseudodragon bonded to the local Warlock. The wounded animal belonged to the local blacksmith. He was very grateful that Storie had found it; it had been missing for several days and he had feared the worst. The blacksmith was more than happy to introduce her to the Warlock in return for her timely rescue.The Warlock found Storie unimpressive and initially dismissed her. ""You can't be a Warlock just to have an 'adorable' pet!"" he scolded. Storie persisted, however, and eventually he told her that if she could find a patron he would accept and train her. It took three long years of apprenticeship before he would allow her to attempt to gain a familiar but she did eventually bond her own pseudodragon. She named her new friend Charme. During these years she had continued to help with her parents' shop, taking on a formal job acquiring stock for them. They were not excited about her decision to take up such a ""dark art"" but it made her happy and her bright, always helpful personality never changed. They eventually accepted her choice. Charme helped. Such an endearing mascot drew in more customers. Four years after she left her apprenticeship Storie's parents sent her on a trip across the land to purchase and bring back some rare reagents a visiting Sorceress had ordered. During the trip the train she was on was accosted by the Emperor's personal guards. Storie was roughly dragged from her seat and knocked unconscious. When she awoke she found herself in some sort of jail cell. The man across the hall, a Bard named Lind, provided the details. She had been dragged in by the local guard and added to some list as ""Family of people known to be working with the Rebellion."" Storie had no idea what this rebellion was or if her parents were secretly working for it but she knew one thing: Those guards were likely after her parents now. If she could get out of here then she was going to find this rebellion and rescue her family.

When there were no visitors to his home, he rushed to the library, reading all that he could about the world around him. Stumbling across a historical tome of Milani, goddess of (revolutionary) freedom and justice, Auberdine learned of the heros and leaders who fought for their friends and families throughout the years. He wanted that glory.

Fire.I had to go big or go home, so I sold my parents' souls (because I enjoy having a soul, and I NEEDED this) to not only a demon prince, but to THE Prince of Demons.So it's just me, wanting to go off on an adventure and find out what wonders I can learn, and if the world burns down with me, then at least my patron will be satisfied."9/18/2017 17:12:39,Bronwen Silvertounge,Tiefling,Cleric,"Grandmother was a succubus. She had two children, a Alu Fiend and a Cambion. The Cambion had a child with a woman from a underground crime family called the blade and tongues. The child grew to be a great bard, but not a thief. He would distract crowds while his sister robbed them. This was Baldwin Silvertongue, not Bronwen. Bronwen was abandoned by the Alu Fiend at an orphanage run by the church. He was raised there until he was 10. It was then when the clerics discovered the near identical tiefling child, Baldwin. They tracked down Baldwin's mother, who was shocked to meet a child so much like her son. She denied that he was her child. Then the Cambion appeared in a cloud of smoke, saying that this was his sister's child. They then took Bronwen with them and raised him for the next 5 years. He ran away because the family was full of criminal heathens. He went back to the church, where he was raised to follow the laws, and be a generally good person. He trained to be a cleric, and a Investigator."9/18/2017 9:27:53,Reverence the TyrHammer,Tiefling,Paladin,"Originally born Johnathan Windsom, his being a tiefling was due to his grandfather reneging on his deal with a demon to become a wealthy noble. He believed since his son was a man that the demon's threat was now empty and refused to honor thier deal, not knowing that doing so would curse his two twin grandsons to a life of being cursed to live with the demon's corruption. Since they were twins, the demon's power was split and did not become the true demon it intended. While well loved by their parents, the boys were sent to the army as soon as they were old enough to hide the shame of their existence, buying both of them a commission in the King's army. Reverence rose quickly through the ranks due to his inborn compassion and his brother reveled in the bloodshed, being closer to the anger of the demon. Reverence commanded a large force of undesirables (tieflings, criminals, and other dregs of society that were not deemed fit for the army at large). They were meant to be the trash thrown against the frontlines and die a miserable death, but Reverence's leadership and his brother's ferocity saw them through losing no more than 15 men of a unit of 250."9/18/2017 8:48:08,Zilia Sas Drace,Tiefling,Blood Hunter (homebrew),"Zilia hails from the city of Gier'vey, a primarily Tiefling city known for its scientific advancements in alchemy.

This stone however was no where near as stable as a true philosopher stone, and because of that issue started and quickly escalated. From the stone, a corrupted essence seeped outwards, and into the dark corners of the city where it fester and multiplied. People went missing and soon creatures started appearing. In response to this and for th e sake of good PR, the alchemist trained and created infusions for their new clean up crew, the ""Mercurial Guard"". Zilia was one such member and she used her talents along side the others to stop every single threat. Over time the situation became better and members began to retire. Zilia was one of the last members to retire leaving only 4 left of the original 60. One night, explosions and rioting could be heard throughout the ciry, and zilia dawns her uniform once more to figure out what is going on.

The country’s main city, Claerview, launched an aeronautical attack on the island of Helmfirth, taking Shalith and a few others into their army as they razed the town when she was 15. Shalith took this as an opportunity for a new start, but was faced with distrust and animocity due to her status as a tiefling and her low position as a scout. She slowly worked up the ranks, developing skills in stealth and dexterity. She found friends in her battalion, particularly with other scouts and lower ranking soldiers. The Claerview army was deployed to Half Point when she was 21, inciting a battle that caused mass casualties on both sides. Shalith and six other soldiers planned to desert, a feat that few survive. They escaped, but four were caught by fellow soldiers. Shalith and the remaining two barely survived until found by Dowhaven residents after a year of running. She was housed by Shiloh. They fell in love slowly and married when she was 25. They and the handful of other villagers in Dowhaven live on farming, and she was forced to return to campaign in order to continue their hidden existence and defend them from the Claerview."9/18/2017 11:58:28,Clavis Roaringrim,Tiefling,Wizard,"Clavis Roaringrim is an Illusionist Mage from a long line of Tiefling arcanists living in Sigil. His father, a high ranked Artificer felt his son needed to have some real world experience, and had him forcibly taken to the Forgotten Realms and left to his own devices. Clavis is a shameless flirt, and proud of his abilities to charm, trick, and lie his way out of any situation. His skills in the arcane arts are well developed if poorly utilized. Growing up in Sigil, he became familiar with many planes and their denizens, which sometimes get mixed up in his mind, causing some confusion to others in his mannerisms and sense of history. He is easily recognizable for the feathered wide brimmed hat he wears between his horns, and the matching purple tinted tunic and cape he wears, along with a distinctive staff bearing the mark of his house. His tiefling blood has left him with slightly red skin, a pair of wide re-curved horns swept back from his temples, and a fork-tipped tail he keeps hidden under his elaborate cloak. His infernal rage is normally kept in check, but when he becomes frustrated or disgruntled, he tends to lash out with the little pyromancy he knows. Clavis has spent several years roaming the Realms, and recently has taken up with a small band of adventurers for want of anything more engaging to fill his time.

Once he took Ezell with him, he tried to teach Ezell his own life style, taking him to every sort of celebration he could find. Ezell thought those were fun but, because of the way his mother raised him, he also thought that the constant partying was too reckless. something that turned out true to him when the poor tiefling ended up loosing an arm because of a drunken barbarianhe couldn't find his way back home so he lived as a thief/beggar. while running away from guards and hiding in a forest, a certain fey entity finds him and begins to mock the tiefling, blaming ezell for the situation he found himself in and ordering Ezel to beg for his life. Ezel doesn't do it and lies in the entity's face, saying that he was only resting a bit. even knowing that Ezell was lying, the Fey sympathises with him. The fey turns out to be Pan, a dead god of sorts, as he isn't worshipped or feared anymore but continues to exists through sheer force of will... and another source of power, which he keeps a secret. he gives ezell his arm back by turning the tree Ezell was resting on into some sort of wooden prosthetic and gives the tiefling a fragment of his power, but already warns him that he will come back to take what ezell owes him.

His parents ran a general store which had been the center of his life for as long as he remembered. It was a labor of nearly half a century to build the business. Dax’s father was particularly concerned with cultivating a favorable reputation within the community. When Dax’s parents passed away and Dax inherited the store, he was dedicated to maintaining and building on his father’s legacy. He had some moderate success in running the business on his own. The store was more profitable than ever.After being on his own for about a decade, he began to itch for something else to do with his time. He really wanted to give more back to his community. There was a particular alderman named Edward Mardog. Alderman Mardog was uniformly disliked by the townspeople and his seat was up for reelection. Everyone agreed that if some brave person were to run against Mardog, they could win easily and it would surely be an improvement. Dax decided that he could be such a brave person.The election was a disaster. As soon as Dax announced his intention, the people turned against him. It became evident that, though they didn’t care for Mardog, they absolutely hated the idea of a tiefling in government. Everyone made it clear that they aproved of Dax’s family only as long as they stayed in their place. Dax was heartbroken to find out that his father’s legacy was only a thin illusion of respect. The town that he called home would never consider him a citizen.He lost a lot of friends. He lost even more regular customers. His store never recovered. Less than two months after the election, he was forced to close his doors. He determined that if he was doomed to die in poverty, he was going to do it out of sight of the people who had rejected and humiliated him. Late in the night, he locked up his shop and struck out for Cana."9/18/2017 15:56:25,Redemption,Tiefling,Sorcerer,"""On the day of the alignment, when all the signs are present, one will be born of the greatest evils of the world, that will bring destruction to his enemies.""So... happy birthday to me, I guess.Look, I wasn't there.  Alright, technically, I was.  What I mean is, I wasn't... aware... enough at the time to take note of the ""signs"" myself.  So for all I know, someone read some sign wrong.  *growling* Or perhaps cutting me out of my mother at the ""appropriate time"" doesn't count as being ""born"" as far as mystical prophecies go.  *growling intensifies* Or maybe expecting an infant to slay all of your enemies for you...*takes a few deep breaths*Sorry.

On the bad days... well, they had someone, a reminder of past failures, to take their frustrations out on when another one of their plans didn't go quite as they hoped.When the scales started growing in, I thought it was due to years of having to clean up some fairly noxious substances.

He grew up in the slaver's house and worked in the kitchen, which kept him sheltered from the true atrocities committed by his owners. 		One night as Malfior was finishing cleaning up after making dinner another slave came bursting into the kitchen with slashes and bruises all over his body.Malfior had absolutely no idea who the slave was or what to do. Moments after the unknown slave burst in, two of the master's sons walked in and killed the unknown slave in front of Malfior, exposing him to what life was really like for those not fortunate enough to be in a comfortable position. After seeing themurder of another fellow slave he started planning an uprising with theother slaves in the kitchen. They slowly spread the word to the otherhouse slaves, and it eventually made its way to all the slaves on the property. 		The uprising was brutal, bloody, and fast. The slaves who were tasked with guarding the family were the first to turn and bear weapons on their masters. After the family was dispatched it became a free for all on the remaining extended family members and paid staff. After all was said and done the house layin ruins and anything of value had been looted. Malfior left before he could see any other person be killed. He adopted a life of crime to keep himself fed andclothed. He never took more than he needed and never stole from someone who didn't have extra to spare.		 One night he attempted to steal from a lavish temple in the biggest city he had taken residence in yet.

Malfior expected swift and harsh punishment, but was offered two options. Leave as he came and never return,or learn the teachings of helm and pick himself up out of the life of a thief.

My horns measure 9"" in length, curling up over my black hair, coming near to meeting in a point past my crown.I grew up in Baldur's Gate with my human mother (Tessele), a scullery maid. My Tiefling father (Reverence) having been a mercenary in the employ of the Flaming Fists, had died during guard duty, whilst attempting to drive off a lycanthrope. My mother worked the kitchen of the manse of Stor Wallwind, a Cleric of Helm. A Paladin of Kelemvor (Sealmyd Dulsaer), tracing a series of murders believed Stor to be a vampire . He decided to ""cleanse"" the manse & attempted to put all the inhabitants to the sword, before burning it to the ground. I watched as my mother was gutted and flung to the ground. As Sealmyd slid his blade through my throat, Stor ran. A cleric in service to the God of guardians, protection, and protectors ran. He left the innocent to die. As I lay with my life leeching from my body, the Weaver called to me offering power to change the world; to remove the destructive influence of the Gods. To end the evil deeds done in the name of the Divine. The speech of a god is the act of creation itself, but what happens when the gods lie? The small accumulated deceptions come together, forming a creature of webs and treachery, lies and deceit. The Weaver, it is called, but it is a being woven from the lies of the gods themselves. Its influence is felt each day, in the small comforts one tells oneself to the greatest of blasphemies against the divine concordant. Spiders toil in service to the Weaver of Lies.The Weaver of Lies is a dark being in the shape of a giant blackish purple spider with glowing orange eyes. My arcane focus is an orb reminiscent of the Weaver; a dark purple orb streaked with thin white lines with a dim orange glow at the center.As I toil to reduce the power of the Gods, my current alias is that of a lost descendant of Duke Jananth of Baldur's Gate, ""attempting"" to acquire allies and equipment to take back the keep that is rightfully mine."9/17/2017 23:39:33,Anthy,Tiefling,Druid,"Antheia, or ""Anthy"" as she prefers, was raised by her mother in a vast swamp, known simply as ""The Mire."" Their hut sat atop stilts in a grove of willow trees prone to dramatic fog banks. She was raised as a Druid, learning to live off the land, monitor the health of the bogs, and drive away destructive creatures. Her mother said once that her grandmother joined the Druidic tradition in atonement for a crime against nature by infernal ancestors, but Anthy didn't listen very close and doesn't remember the details.They did not live in complete isolation. Anthy's mother was a skilled apocethary and sold herbs, potions, and even poisons to those who sought her out. Sometimes they dealt with the lizardfolk tribes, but more often they traded with the citizens of Muddybottom, a backwater riverside town nearby. Her mother played up the aura of fear and mystery from her Tiefling features and magic to keep trade terms agreeable and to protect them, maintaining a dramatic ""witch"" persona. Anthy took to her mother's art and soon did the bulk of the potion brewing, but considered the theatrics more of a fun game than a necessity. Her mother often said they must be self-reliant due to their race, but Anthy found it hard to believe people are as cruel as her mother claims.A few months back, her mother left abruptly at the call of The Splintered Oak, a Druidic organization. Anthy began to worry when she did not return for months, as these excursions had previously never lasted for more than one month, but continued to keep shop in her mother's absence.One day a rather rude customer made threats to Anthy, demanding ludicrous prices with the excuse of ""the magistrate will have your infernal head soon anyway.""  While this left her confused and shaken, weeks went by without incident. Then, one evening upon return from gathering herbs she saw her hut being set ablaze by armed soldiers of Muddybottom.  Her shock was broken by a crossbow bolt grazing her horn and soldiers rushing at her. Calling upon the swamp to entangle them, she hastily retreated into the bogs where they could not hope to track her.  While Anthy can live off the land, she cannot bear the thought of a forever solitary life and has made for the nearest city, hoping to find this ""Splintered Oak"" to track down her mother."9/18/2017 8:13:43,Ekira,Tiefling,Warlock,"Patches has been my best friend for as long as I can remember. For a long time I didn't undersatnd much of what Patches would say to me, but it didn't matter, he was still my best friend. I'd talk to him all the time, even when I didn't understand his answers. Patches taught me lots of stuff, like about what he calls arcane sigils and Elditch invocations, so I could play with lights and fire.I liked it when Patches taught me to speak to mummy without moving my lips, and we played tricks on the other children when I'd speak without lips and say I was a ghost. They got all scared and one boy wet himself. It was super funny.Mummy didn't like it though. She always got angry when I spoke without lips and was very cross when I listened to Patches and not her. She said sorry once for being cross with me and gave me a really special cake with lots of icing and rainbow sweeties too. It looked so delicious I gave mummy a big hug. She was very funny and started to cry and told me to be a good boy and eat the cake. Patches got very angry and told me not to eat the cake. He said I should give it all to mummy because I'd made her cry. We went out to play, and when I came hom, the cake was in the bin. Mummy said it wasn't good anymore, but I think she was cross with me again.My favorite game to play with Patches was Hero Adventurer, So the night that Patches woke me up and something smelt funny, I was excited because it was finally time to be a real hero adventurer. I grabbed my hero kit and Patches told me to be very quiet. We played a sneaking game to trick mummy and go outside without her knowing. Patches made me take my good winter coat, and that was good because it was cold. I tried my best to be very quiet when we sneaked through the city, and I must of been the best at the sneaking game because we didn't see any city guards. The smell got really bad but Patches told me not to worry about it. I trust him, so I didn't.And he told me where to go and how to become and adventurer and now it's super amazing because I'm in an adventuring party and were going to have real adventurers, not play ones, and I'm going to be a real hero!"9/18/2017 11:01:54,Mischief Goldheart,Tiefling,Sorcerer ,"About nineteen years ago, my mother was raped during a raid-nine months later, poof-baby Tiefling with bright red skin, horns (which grew to be a hands' length, pointing backwards) and a particularly thin, arrow-headed tail born to a human mother. My sapphire-blue eyes and dark blue hair must have been unnerving against my ruddy skin, and my mother abandoned me on the steps of the Cleric healer's convent of Pelor ((also called Al'Asran), the god of the Sun. Older man, golden hair and beard, shining white clothing) a few hours up the mountain outside of town. She probably thought that, as holy people, they would dispose of me.Instead they sought to change my negative past into a positive and named me Gold-Heart, taking me under their wings. I was raised by the Clerics, and tried to take their path. I had little skill for it, however. Rather, I had little patience for the rituals and little interest in memorizing the complex prayers, preferring to spend my time with wounded children and cheer them up. The nurses didn't begrudge it-in fact most of them were grateful that the children had someone their age to play with and keep them occupied, as they prefered to tend to the adult wounded.When I was nine this became easier as my talents as a Sorceress made themselves known. One night I was dealing with a child in particularly bad pain-I believe she had been cursed, and the matrons were having difficulty naming it in order to produce a counter. One of the elder Clerics, a stuffy man with little sense of humor, came into the room and asked me curtly to make sure the girl, only about five, 'kept it down' so he could attend to a passing noble with a flesh wound. Understandably, the girl was embarrassed and I was angry at his obvious lack of concern for those with less money. I wanted to punish him-but mostly I wanted to cheer the girl up. I wished suddenly and intensly that I could scare the living daylights out of the old bastard! The ability to manifest the illusion of a spider the size of a dog, I thought, would be hysterical.And suddenly a spider the size of a dog appeared in front of him. He let out a loud shriek and stumbled backwards-the girl was frightened for just a moment but she saw the grin on my face and must have realized it was my thoughts creating the spider. She started giggling and clapping her hands.I was sent to bed that night without dessert by the elder-but some of the nurses brought me up some after lights out time. Thereafter I got the nickname ""Mischief"" for the subtle pranks I played on the staff members and some of the better humored patients. By then I knew about Tiefling heritage and that a Valor name is usually taken, and I thought this one particularly fantastic so I adopted it as my first name. None of my caretakers objected. As a convent, we had plenty of books, and I trained myself in the way of a few basic spells and cantrips. One of the elder men at the convent had a few adventures under his belt and happily taught me staff fighting.  Whether he wanted to relive his glory days or give me a suitable and safe outlet for my energy I know not. Another ten years went by and I grew more and more restless--I was still a Tiefling, after all, and my penchant for causing Mischief (however well-meant)  was also growing to be more and more of a pain for the Clerics. Still, they always appreciated that I kept the children happy whenver I could. When a visiting Paladin nobleman came through the convent and offered to take me adventuring with him, I doubt he expected me to nearly jump on him with enthusiasm-but I did."9/18/2017 13:40:52,Khari,Tiefling,Rogue,"It came as no surprise to the young tiefling, Khari, when he was sat down in front of his parents and told that he was adopted. He had already suspected as such, being that one parent was an elf and the other was a half-orc, and neither was inclined toward any sort of infernal arts. The fact that they were lesbians would normally have clued him in as well, but at such a young age, he didn't quite make the connection. They told him that he was found as a young toddler, unconcious and abandoned in the desert wastes by a passing trade caravan, where he was taken to the tiny backwater town of Dust. Truth be told, the news didn't exactly change anything for Khari. With such a low population in general, there were only a couple other tieflings in town, and Khari, specifically, was the only imp-spawn, so he already felt like an outcast. As he grew older, Khari rebelled against his loving parents, and with Dust having a very short arm of the law, the tiefling garnered quite a reputation for bringing trouble wherever he went.Eventually, however, that trouble caught up with him, when, one summer night, a short series of misadventures ended with a stable fire. The fire killed many of the town's horses, and the blame was placed on Khari. Dust's old Sheriff had had enough, and Khari found his arms shackled in cold iron for the first time in his life. Khari was to wait in the Sheriff's jail until the local Marshall could take him to trial, but with the threat of severe punishment on the horizon, Khari managed to pull out one of his teeth and use it to pick the primative lock on his cell door and escape into the night.Catching up to a trade caravan that had just left town, Khari managed to hitch a ride to the nearest port harbor of Starboard. The tiefling wasn't prepared to be on the run, however, and tried to steal some food once he had arrived, but was quickly noticed. It seemed that the bustling city was all too familiar with Khari's brand of trouble. The tiefling managed to evade capture, but he was afraid that the chase would bring notice of his presence to the Marshall that would be hunting him down, so Khari snuck aboard a trade ship and waited until they were out at sea to reveal himself.In the nature of Khari's ever evolving string of bad luck, it turned out that the ship he found himself on was crewed by a group of pirates that weren't too happy at the notion of being a taxi service. Instead, they alleviated that frustration by pressing Khari into their gang. The imp-spawn, of course, hated it. He was stripped of his belongings and forced to work the gross, menial tasks that the ship needed performed. As such, he continued to cause trouble for the crew, picking fights and spreading mischief. But, as time went on, the pain of servitude lessened, both from familiarity and from climbing in the crew's duties, and Khari began to work alongside the crew instead of against them, coming to even enjoy his life as a pirate. The tiefling began to see the rest of the crew as something of another surrogate family, and they saw him as the little devil imp they had adopted.This too, unfortunately, wasn't meant to last. Around the time that Khari finally came of age, he became distracted while performing his duties in the crow's nest, and a Captial Navy vessel crept up on them, opening fire in the dead of night while most of the crew slept. The ship ended up sinking, but having gone down relatively near Aurias' western coast, it was thought that there might have been survivors. And so it was, as Khari eventually drifted to shore, alone and afraid. After a day of wandering, he stumbled upon an old cottage, where an elderly man helped nurse him back to health. Not wanting to bring attention to himself, Khari pretended to suffer from amnesia. After a couple of days of rest, a Naval official pounded on the cottege door, and asked the man if he had encountered any survivors of the battle. The old man surprised Khari by denying any strange visitors or happenstance, sending the official away. While the old man believed that it was likely that Khari was, in fact, one of the shipwrecked pirates, he believed that in his amnesiatic state, he could start a new leaf and leave that troubled life behind.This entire time, Khari had gone nameless to the old man, in order to keep up his ruse. It was at this point that the old man suggested that the tiefling adopt the name Trouble. He admitted it was a bit superstitious, but he thought that perhaps by placing his ""troubles"" at the forefront of his person, he could avoid it affecting him as it so clearly had in what they believed to be his past life. The imp-spawn took the name, and agreed to be led to the nearby city of Height, in order to truly find his new lot in life.As soon as the old man left the newly christened Trouble to his own devices, however, the tiefling almost immediately fell back to the only way of life he really knew. With naught to his name, he started raiding food stores, and ended up running into the local underground in the process. Asking to work with the group, he started working his way up the ranks of the criminal world, much like he had on the pirate ship.***It has been two years since he first came to Height, and in the process has worked a lot of easier jobs, like lookout and bagman, as he properly learned the trade of larceny. Caught on a charge of loitering (while casing out a joint), Trouble ended up working a job for Height's High Mage, and in the process ended up saving the city. This had the unfortunate effect of putting his face out there for the city to see, but even the criminal element was grateful for his efforts. After seeing what he was capable of, Trouble was promoted to a full, proper thief in the organization, and now works with DAN THE HARVESTER, using the lich as a fence.Trouble loves his new life, and has grown attached to the people of his organization, people who he's tempted to call his third family. He even greatly enjoys the thrill of working for the ""good guys"", and there's always a grin on his face when Va'al drops by for a visit. But much like his other adventures, he's sure that it's just a matter of time before his troubles catch up to him once again, and then this too, will end. Only time will tell how messy it will be, if Trouble's luck of escaping it even continues at all."9/18/2017 10:56:57,Noya,Tiefling,Sorcerer,"What should have been a wonderful day turned into quite a shock. Although her mother was fair and charming and her father was strong and rugged, Cináed took it to an extreme. She was born with a Infernal and a Primordial Bloodline by no choice of her own, but just the funny coincidence that the exact time that those curses or blessings would surface in one body, hers. In contrast her twin brother who came out only minutes later had no strange features at all.As you might imagine this has the potential for a lot of trouble. Since tieflings are almost universally hated or treated with prejudice, because of a certain stunt Asmodeus pulled claiming all tieflings as his own and changing their appearance to be more devilish. Furthermore primordials are known for their wanton destruction and selfishness. Though one thing stood against that all the one thing you could call a bright spot in this amalgamation of negativity, her incredible beauty and this caused some trouble of its own.Noya Cináed Coldsplitter was born in Waterdeep, the City of Splendor. She lived in the South ward, the poor section of the city. Her father was a dockworker, until he died by a falling crate when she was 15, and her mother is a seamstress. Although they were poor they did manage to get by and not go hungry all the time, which is quite a feat considering she had six siblings. So from a young age Noya had to help her mother with her craft which kept her conveniently away from the children who teased and bullied her about her appearance and her lack of a shadow. The times she didn’t have to help her mother were less pleasant, however her brother was always there to support and defend her.Contrary to what one might think about her personality Noya was actually quite outgoing and mischievous. Frequently getting into trouble because of the pranks she pulled with her magic. Though she quite often managed to get away with it because she was so cute and charming then. However it’s unsure if it was her own charm or her magical talent. Her brother wasn’t so lucky, but she never let him get punished from the things she did or they both did.Not all pranks ended so fortunate. One time at the age of nine when pranking a merchant with an illusionary sound the horse startled and ran her over. This incident caused her to almost lose her life, leaving her within an inch of death.	If it wasn’t for her supernatural toughness she would have been no more. While there was a great downside to her injuries, she was bedridden for many months, there was also an upside. Noya became more adept at sewing and making clothes, even designing them. Although there was little opportunity for the latter, because of their low wealth. Eventually in later years she managed to attract attention for her works by a more famous seamstress, dressmaker or tailor called Madeleine. Whatever you wanted to call it, she was good at it. Madeleine was really what got Noya into tailoring and dressmaking. Madeleine taught her the tricks of the trade and mentored her. She introduced Noya to the high society and taught her how to behave in such company. While simultaneously modeling the garments, with her brother, her mistress created in exchange for her apprenticeship. This and an extra stipend allowed her parents and her siblings to live more comfortable and not have to slave away at their jobs, though they preferred to continue their professions.Of course this got Noya in touch with the noble’s son and daughters some of which took a fancy to her, while others were put off by her appearance. In her early teens Noya learned a bit more about some noble’s sons, but it was never more than that.At her 15th year a horrible event occurred. Noya’s father was killed in an accident at the docks. Getting crushed under a crate his death was swift, but the consequences were not. This event had a profound effect on Noya. Her father, Malcer, was her rock. If she ever needed help he was there for her. That was now gone and she didn’t handle it well. One noble son took advantage of her vulnerability and with his charm he managed to gain her interest. During the dance, one of the many she had attended in name of her mistress, Madeleine, the noble’s son grew impatient. The reason he had approached her was because of her beauty and exoticness. Noya was to be another mark on his post. One more in a long line of defiled girls. One more girl to boast about to his friends.After a few hours he tried to coerce and pull her into the gardens. The gardens wherein so many girls before her had lost their innocence, but Noya did not want to be one of them. She resisted and pulled back, but her strength then was not what it is now and she couldn’t stop him. That is when she revealed her magical ability and she viciously mocked his charm, his manners and his appearance leaving him spitting blood and it enabled her to escape from his grasp long enough for her brother to come her side and defend her. The noble’s son being humiliated in public so audibly fled in his shame and he still holds a grudge against Noya to this day.Rumors were spread about Noya, her being a devil’s child and dancing naked under the moon singing in prayer to her patron and on other days she would supposedly cut open babies and eat their hearts. People avoided her for this for a while, but not everyone was so susceptible to the ridiculous rumors. A small group either not caring about her enough to believe the rumors or knowing Noya enough that they were false.One such a boy attracted her attention. His name was Torlyn Wands and he was seemingly unaffected by both her appearance and her magical abilities. Which of course was the result of his familiarity with this. It is he whom she gave her innocence on her sixteenth birthday and it was he who she planned to marry when she became eighteen. However it was not to be, the closer Noya got to eighteen the more restrained their relationship became. Until he at last confessed to her the impossibility of their marriage due to the pressure his family put upon him to instead marry a girl with a less ill repute. Heartbroken she could not stand being in Waterdeep where such precious memories lay dormant, but also great pains, so she left the city seeking means elsewhere.The years after she spend traveling from city to city finding work as a seamstress, before eventually traveling further, because no city was like home. On her travel she occasionally had troubles with bandits and monsters and had to reveal her magical talents to fight them off. Something she preferred not to do, because it would gain her unwanted attention. Which Noya already got enough of if not for her beauty, it was for her devilish or elemental appearance.What she not wanted did eventually happen when she was 21. In the city of Neverwinter Noya was accosted by a drunk merchant in a particularly high-end establishment. No matter what she did, from polite refusal to angry shoving, nothing worked. Eventually she told him to take a hike with more force than normal and as soon as she was done the man turned around abruptly and walked out of the establishment to the astonishment of a lot of people inside. To be using magic so blatantly and openly on another citizen is not something many would dare. Realizing what she had done, Noya quickly gathered her belongings and fled the building. She started making her way home making sure not to take a direct path to make it more difficult for anyone to follow her. It took Noya a while to get there. However finally at home she wasn’t alone. A man was inside and he offered her a proposition to join their organization and they would help her stay away from the guards that time. This is how she got to work with the Order of the Star Mages and it is how she got where she is today."9/18/2017 13:05:30,Sebastian Clearsky,Tiefling,Sorcerer,"In a backwards land, a small and insignificant lord tried to summon a Devil to try and become a Warlock. Unfortunately he was tricked by the Wizard that sold him the ritual (or the Wizard was way less capable than he believed) and instead ended up face to face with a Demon not interested in upholding any side of any contract.Some time after the failed attempt, a child birth is preceded by all kinds of strange events: 9 goats started ramming their heads against rocks until killed, black, distorted frogs rained from the clear sky out of nowhere, all milk turned sour as soon as the sun went away, kids refused to make any sound for the whole night and every domesticated animal ran away from the mother in labor, going as far as hurting it's handlers if they tried to stop the animals. The woman died during childbirth.The kid was something from the nightmares and scary stories: two curved horns, bright eyes without pupils, a long tail moving slowly and several pointed protrusions over its dark red, almost brown skin. The baby, covered in blood and happily chewing parts of the deceased mother is taken to the nearby forest and left alone by terrified midwifes, certain they have angered some vengeful Devil or Fey.An old Druid woman stumbles upon the baby while investigating the strange behavior shown by the wild animals and decides to raise the creature and gives it a human name, Sebastian Clearsky.The kid grows up mostly alone with his foster mother in the forest. He's able to hunt, though not reliably - some animals can't abide his presence, yet others just stand deathly still when he's nearby. He can light a fire and set up camp. He learns how to read the marks on the vegetation to know if there's a pack of Wolves hunting game or if there's a Will-o'Wisp bothering the pregnant bear nearby. He knows what plants will give him edible fruits and which branches are better to support a tent. He's not exactly attuned to the nature around him, but even though he struggles, he learns how to deal with the his reality.Strange things sometimes happen around hi: claw marks in tress that belong to no known animal or monster nearby, fog and hail appear for some minutes in the middle of summer and every once in a while bugs will appear in masses inside one of his footsteps.Humans he interacted with were either afraid or angry at him; people just assumed he was an evil being. His mother, Lorena Clearsky, never judged him for what he was, but she never judged him for what he did either. She believed that things were what they were and her job was to help nature balance itself - which was the natural flow when things just were what they were.The idea that Sebastian was something other than what he thought he was terrified him. He didn't want to be a mere spectator to his own life's fate. 'What if I'm evil, no matter what I try to do?' He didn't really strive to be a beacon of good of morality, he just wanted to be himself, not a puppet to gods, devils or ancient dragons.When he's a little over 14 he comes across a young woman guarding a merchant cart all by herself in a desert road. She's the first person not to be afraid of him and even start talking to the Tiefling and being pleasant. Her name is Clarissa, she's short, head filled with a blond wavy hair, fair skinned, with small tattoos around her green, round eyes that blend with her multiple freckles. She's just turned 18 and isn't lean nor chubby.They quickly turn into friends and meet each other every week to chat, exchange stories (she once helped his uncle deliver a beautiful jade crown to the nearby lord's daughter's birthday! She been to cities, she's seen elves and dragon bones and gnomish trinkets of all kinds!) and just enjoy each other company. After a few months he's completely charmed by her beauty and joy and sincerity and gracefulness. She invites him to an encounter under the full moon's light and, delighted, Sebastian drinks wine and dances with Clarissa until he passes out.He wakes up on his back, black roots chaining him to the ground inside a crudely drawn circle of weird symbols. His chest is bare and Clarissa towers over him, holding a twisted bright-red blade attached to a handle made of distorted yellow bone, pulsating like a living thing. Her green eyes are inhumanly pale and she's completely naked, tattoos covering her body from the neck to her knees. The tattoos move, scorpions, snakes, spiders and shadows woven into her skin moving swiftly, as if fighting for another inch. From her mouth come wrong sounds, like a serpent or stone crushing or ice snapping or fire melting skin and charring bone; still he understand that she's singing. She's singing, no, she's calling for something bigger and older than creation.As soon as she brings the knife to Sebastian's chest the pain makes the world goes dark; he touches the coldness of the void, he sees depths of the nine circles of hell, he feels the despair of every agonizing soul held away from their gods and penitence. He hears his name being Called, his fate being pushed and pulled around like a dead rabbit thrown to rabid dogs, something dark and powerful and hungry for his role to be fulfilled toys with his soul.He hears and feels and sees everything yet he refuses to let reality have its way. He does not pray, he does not wish, he wills his truth into reality and, for a fraction of a second, creation bends to him. One last image is ironed to his mind before everything goes dark: Clarissa, eyes wide with terror, holding the blade with both hands, all her tattoos gone and his own blood covering her arms up to the shoulders.Sebastian wakes up in the morning alone, shirtless under the cold drizzle. All around him there are crumpled roots and dead things. The stench of rot and acid makes him gag. He feels his chest and finds a neatly healed scar, bright red, in the form of a small rune no bigger than his fist. He touches the weird rune and at once understand its meaning: [BANE].The red dagger is on his left hand, deformed and half melted. The blade is dull, the bright red now faded to an almost rust like color. The yellow bone is shattered but somehow every piece is still in the correct position. It doesn't feel right to leave the dagger in the forest, so he tucks it away and looks around.He can't find any sign of Clarissa or the circle. If not for his scar he would believe it all to have been a strange dream. Strange nightmare, more likely.Sebastian goes back to his hut and finds it completely deserted. No sign of anyone ever living there, just an empty place. He stays there for 3 months, every day going back to the place he woke up and finding nothing different, except for himself. He could feel power, someone's power, his power running inside him.Every day, before leaving the hut, he'd find a rune written somehow. Once it was a swarm of insects that moved together to form the symbol, once the rune in a dead goat's insides. One day it was clawed in every tree around his hut. Blood and feces on the ground; formed by the tangled antlers of a two rotten deers, locked in battle; appeared on patterns on the back of a dead frog, half eaten by the skeleton of a spider.Every day the same rune, the same idea would become clear in his mind as soon as he spotted the rune: [DISTANT CITY](It really depends on the game being run, the idea is that some outer power is prodding him to go to the city where the adventure will being) . He couldn't just accept that thing's order, whatever it was, but he couldn't deny Sebastian has hundreds of questions and no answer:Where was Lorena Clearsky? What happened to her?Who really was Clarissa? Did I somehow cause her to be possessed? Had she been trying to use me since the first day? Was she a good person - the only other person to treat me well - that suffered under some kind of otherwordly horror because of me? Was she a bad person all along that just saw me as an evil source of power? Where is she? What happened?Where is this power coming from? Who is trying to control me? Why [BANE]? Who is toying with my fate?No answers would be found here, there was only one way. Forward, always forward.Sebastian would move on, toward the city. He would grow strong to control his own fate and discover what happened to him."9/18/2017 9:19:25,Lemire,Tiefling,Rogue,"Lemire grew up in the slums of Solarisane. Her father abandoned Lemire’s mother, Daspira, when Lemire and her sister were small children. Although Daspira never told her children much of their father (other than that he was a rotten bastard who deserved eternal suffering in Baator), Lemire suspected that he was the fabled assassin Barlech, and that he abandoned his family for their own safety. For the first few years of her life, Lemire’s family subsisted on a regular delivery of a few coins, presumably from her father. After some time, these deliveries stopped and Daspira soon turned to prostitution to keep her children fed. Daspira was able to fetch a surprisingly large amount of coin selling her body, with many men coming to the slums to fulfill their violent fantasies of “taming a demon.” At the same time, she was subjected to much abuse, and would often come home bleeding and with bruises. Daspira spent more and more time away from home, leaving Lemire to care for her young sister, named Gentle (Daspira had regretted not giving both her daughters “virtue” names, and often referred to Lemire as “Hope,” a name she rejected even as a small girl). When Lemire was twelve years old, she discovered her mother in a tavern purchasing black mold spores. Although Daspira denied that the drug was for her, for Lemire the last several months came into focus. Her mother’s erratic, inscrutable behavior and long spells away from home suddenly made sense in the context of dependency on the evil spores. The worry for her mother that Lemire had carried with her gave way to intense anger. She told Daspira not to bother coming home. Lemire would not see her again for four years. Needing to fully provide for herself and her sister, Lemire took to picking pockets. She was a natural petty thief, and soon became an accomplished pickpocket, cutpurse, and burglar. Although the slums did not offer many lucrative opportunities, the young tiefling felt safe there. While her brick-red skin and budding horns made others mistrustful of her, she knew that the slum was far more accepting than the world at large, and here she did not need to work especially hard to hide her race. When she did venture from the slums, she took care to cover herself in a heavy cloak and scarves to hide her face. While the purses were much heavier in the city center, there was also greater risk of being caught, and Lemire knew that her race would do her no favors if she were put on trial--if she even survived that long. She had heard many tales of tieflings ran through in the streets by the Gold Cloaks and city guards who would leave the bodies in the street while laughing and heading to the tavern for a pint. Needless to say, she only left the slum when she and her sister were especially in need.Lemire and Gentle lived this way for several years. Now old enough to take on some work of her own, Gentle found a job washing tankards at a grimy tavern. The tavern keeper was known for being kindly to tieflings, even when it hurt his business to do so. Many times he would open shop only to find TIEFLING LOVER and nasty epithets painted on his walls. No one knew why he took to tieflings, although Gentle had suspected he had once loved one. Though Lemire’s experience of the world was broader than Gentle’s, it was still rather limited; yet, Lemire felt she knew better than naïve young Gentle. No human man had ever loved a tiefling. Over time, Lemire learned to target other criminals: other cutpurses at first, working her way up to robbers and spore dealers and illegal weapons traders and worse. She especially delighted in stealing from those working for Geth, an infamous human gangster known for being cunning and cruel in equal measures who had taken over most of the black market trade in the slums. She targeted Geth because she had once heard a rumor that Geth had trapped and killed Barlech in his quest to consolidate power. One day, she saw Geth himself perusing wares in the market. She couldn’t believe her eyes. He had three body guards with him, but they seemed to be paying more attention to the shopkeepers and street vendors than they were Geth. She was sure that she was skilled enough to get Geth’s purse, which was tied loosely to his belt. She was wrong.Geth’s guards knocked her unconscious and brought her to one of Geth’s many safe houses. When she came to, the crime lord—slender, tall, gesticulating wildly while he spoke—revealed that he had set a trap for the young tiefling. Suspecting that she had been targeting his men specifically, he decided to present her with an opportunity she could not resist. He was impressed by Lemire’s audacity and told her as much. He asked her why she had been targeting him, but she refused to answer. Even after several broken fingers, she still resisted. “Like father, like daughter, I see,” Geth said, all but outright confirming Lemire’s suspicions that the assassin Barlech had sired her. “Well then, let’s try a different route.” One of Geth’s goons brought forth Gentle, who was restrained at the wrists and ankles and paralyzed with fear. “If you come to work for me, your sister will never want for anything. Riches will be yours. You can even deliver your whore mother from her wretched work.”Lemire, all the wrath of Nine Hells coursing through her, knew she had no other choice. Choking down her disgust and hurt, she agreed. Geth’s face twisted in a wicked smile. “Well, that was far too easy. Your father had much more fight in him.” He signaled to one of his guards who swiftly cut Gentle’s throat. Lemire screamed, kicking, trying to get away from the man who was holding her. Her tail lashed wildly. Geth’s gaze pierced her. “You’re a good thief, this much is true. But you flatter yourself if you think I have any need for a fucking tiefling daughter of a whore. You know, when I killed Barlech, it wasn’t just because he was a threat to me. I did the world a favor by ridding it of that demon spawn. You and your kind are abominations, girl.” Geth told her to leave town by next sunset. “And lest you think I will kill you if you don’t, a fate you’d probably welcome with open arms, know that what I have in mind for you is far, far worse than death.” Geth’s men blindfolded Lemire, knocked her unconscious, and dumped her in an alley.When she awoke, she immediately sought out her mother. She wasn’t sure why. For comfort? To say good-bye? She found her in a decrepit inn near the seaport. She wasn’t easy to rouse, but when she came to, Lemire could tell that her mother already knew what had happened; perhaps she had even helped Geth set his trap, who could say? Lemire didn’t bother accusing her mother; in fact, no words were exchanged between them. Daspira, looking as though she had aged decades, barely able to walk, hobbled over to a chest of drawers. One drawer had a false bottom, and from this hidden chamber she produced a small golden key. In Lemire’s career as a cutpurse she’d seen many such keys; they were for the personal vaults at the central bank. Daspira pressed the key into Lemire’s hand, and looked at her daughter with a sadness that knew no end. The two embraced.That night, Lemire painstakingly filed her horns and packed her few possessions, including a locket belonging to Gentle. She slept fitfully, and in the morning she dressed in her cloak and scarves. She knew she was being watched and did her best to evade Geth’s men. She suspected that they would not follow her into the city center, and she was right. At the central bank, she moved swiftly to the private vaults, her tail wrapped nervously around her left leg. She had expected to be stopped, asked to prove her business in the vaults, but no one so much as looked her way. She made her way to vault 406, the number imprinted in a tiny scrawl on her key, her good hand shaking as she inserted the key, the broken one hanging limply by her side. The lock clicked loudly as it unlatched. She looked over her shoulder. Still, no one was watching. She wondered if the key were perhaps imbued with some kind of magic. She opened the door and couldn’t believe what she saw before her: a silvery-blue needle the length of her arm, thin as spider-silk. She held it, turning it away from the light. She gasped as it seemed almost to disappear.With the small amount of gold she had been saving, her sister’s locket, and her needle wrapped in a scarf, she stowed away in the belly of the caravel The Grey Griffon. Lying uncomfortable in the ship’s bowels, her  dark eyes narrowed. The burning hatred inside her gave her confidence and resolve. “I’ll be back for you, you bastard.” "9/18/2017 21:02:47,Leucis,Tiefling,Ranger,"Leucis spent many years on the high seas as a part of the local slave trade, except in the raw end of the deal. On his 17th birthday, Leucis, two halflings, a minotaur, and a young tiefling named Tharrakir rallied their fellow slaves and took over their ship. That point onward, they took the ship known as ""The Sad Devil of the North"", and these men were pirates. Some time later, after enjoying their newfound freedom, the men were in port at a town known by Novinia. That is were Leucis met his newfound love, a human noble named Violette. Before setting out again, Leucis promised Violette untold riches and treasure when he returned from sea. However, the minotaur thought otherwise. The minotaur, known to some as Caesar, hated being under the leadership of Leucis and his quartermaster Tharrakir, who was but a boy. That trip saw Caesar staging a mutiny to kill both of the tieflings. Thrown overboard and cast away, the two fell-born men found them selves adrift in the eastern coast of Akenmir. With no knowledge of where their ship was, or where Violette was, Leucis used his natural knowledge of the land and Tharrakir's talent for magic to make way as mercenaries. Becoming known as ""The Salted Devil"" or ""The Cast-Away Ranger"", Leucis now finds himself traveling in caravans with Tharrakir, a human woman named Nova, a halforc mercenary named Aleksi, and a younger halforc named Henk."9/18/2017 17:09:58,Talvin of Prendergast,Tiefling ,Paladin/Harper/Inquisitor/Tiefling Paragon,Good-at-heart former inquisitor pledged to uphold the Tymoran faith as one of her very first paladins. 9/18/2017 3:18:29,Koschei,Tiefling ,Paladin/wizard,"Koschei was a street tough, more a mugger than a thief, until one day he broke into an old mans house and found out he'd intruded on a shrine to The Traveller, an obscure old god with a single worshipper.

"9/18/2017 19:13:12,Sera and Erin du/Wyvern,Two-Headed Elf,Warder,"Sera and Erin are a sight to see, resembling a seven and a half foot tall, two-headed elf the sisters are a unique sight to see.On the right is Sera, she of slightly fairer skin and raven black hair kept straight in a simple ponytail, on the left her sister Erin, darker in skin tone with a fiery mane of hair that in parts flows free, and in others decorated with complex braids.The pair are quite a resplendent sight to see in their polished breastplate and violet cape, often astride a titan of an equine mount dubbed ""Leviathania"" or ""Tania"" for short.The duo wields a massive copper-plated sword atop an elongated hilt that makes it seem to function more of a spear than a proper sword, dubbed the Titan Blade, is based off of Tian Xian Nodachi, but with a longer, thicker blade, and a shorter haft.Dubbed the Magnum Opus, the weapon is the sisters' pride and joy and the shining paragon example of their craftsmanship at work. The pair have put their life savings into the blade, which may harbor a few tricks.The pair are well built and athletic, their frame made strong by working the force, their might for practicality, not beauty.The sisters share the du'Wyvern eyes; violet with a discoloration in the iris resembling a brown X, a family of minor nobility with branches scattered throughout the major cities of Golarion.The pair have different preferences in fashion, with Sera preferring beads and dangling rings, while Erin prefers more solid pieces and dwarven things that menace with spikes.The pair are part of the du'Wyvern noble family, a moderately well-off lineage spawned by the famed adventurer Thea du'Wyvern. Thea has left a trail of half-everything children spread over the globe in her centuries of life, and has started pawning off new ones on the fully grown ones in order to have more time for adventuring.The pair see their mother once, perhaps twice a year. She's currently south of Cheliax, poking around in the Mwangi Expanse. The sisters were instead raised by their older sister Kary, who is half-elf and half-dwarf.Sera and Erin's parentage has rarely come up, with Kary stating that the matter is ""An unpleasant family shame that should not be spoken of.""Sera and Erin took this to mean their mother had been forced into carnal relations with an Ettin, but the truth of the matter is that Thea is in fact a shape-shifter of some sort who travels the world not only for adventure, but also to basically boink anything that moves, and a few things that don't.Sera and Erin are two sides of the same coin. Sera is somewhat shy, quiet, and bookish, while Erin is loud, aggressive, boisterous, and utterly bereft of an indoor voice.Sera likes making things, while Erin likes wrecking things.Their mutual love is forging weapons and armor, which they do as a career. They get to make things that they then use to break things. They frequently take out new arms and armor designs on short adventures to test them against monsters and bandits and make their neck of the woods just a little bit safer.The pair are quite fond of their home city, though they generally find the rest of Cheliax to be rather unpleasant, and as a result have loose ties to certain rebel factions.Mostly it's slipping a little financial support here and there, occasionally it's making weapons and armor on the sly, free of any tax mark or artisan's stamp.As a result they have ties to the black market, able to sell for a little more and buy for a little less than most folks.The pair have had a classical education, and are quite intelligent and try to know a little about a lot, though their main branch of study was history and philosophy. Not particularly useful for an adventurer, but maybe some day they can branch out their studies.Despite their various shades of awkwardness, Sera the quiet nerd and Erin the immature jock, something just seems... different about the pair. Some natural aura of power or strength that makes lesser men and women look the them for leadership.Or maybe it's just because they're seven and a half ruddy feet tall and easily stand out in a crowd.Sera and Erin are trained the the path of the Warder, a knight-defender who emphasizes guarding their allies and stymieing the movement of their foes. The sisters' nature as two minds sharing one body gives them the capacity to easily wield what to most people would be a primary weapon in each hand, though they prefer to use their gigantic Titan Blade to keep enemies at bay, and retracting the shaft of the mighty polearm when foes get up close and personal, adding body blocks with their spiked armor to complement the dire blows from the Blade.The pair are trained primarily in the use of multiple weapons, requiring the use of lighter armor than most noble knights receive in training to better be prepared to make multiple angles of attack, but they make up for it by being able to almost always manage to get a weapon in the way.And like any knight, the pair have been trained in mounted combat, and despite their lack of a delicate touch and extreme personality, actually seem to ride and command their steed better than one would expect them to.The pair's mighty steed is a massive war-trained beast named Leviathania, or Tania for short, but when not in battle the horse is actually rather placid and surprisingly gentle.The sisters often treat Tania more as a pet than as a proper warhorse, and the creature is left in her stable as often as not when the sisters go adventuring. Sera is shy and tends towards quiet introspection.Erin is loud, often obnoxious, and has no filter between brain and mouth.And to top it all off if being seven foot tall and two headed wasn't strange looking enough, their shadow also happens to be weird. It changes shape based on whatever the pair is doing, usually in a form that seems to be some sort of quasi-sarcasting commentary on whatever they're doing.Adding angelic wings when Sera is giving an impassioned speech about the rights of the downtrodden, adding clawed fingers and devil horns when Erin is getting a little bit too bloodlusty in battle, making cartoonish, exaggerated sneaking motions when the pair are trying to be quiet while clanking about in the noisy armor covering their large, clumsy frame.It doesn't detect as magical, it doesn't respond to exorcism, the sisters have just learned to ignore it and state that it's the result of an obnoxious fey curse. To which their shadow makes a :P on itself where their heads would be.Sera and Erin have ties to their older sister Kary, Kary's handful of servants, a few folks in the smithing community, and a few people she's kept in touch with from her school days. The du-Wyvern townhouse would be in Villegre somewhere.For the most part her deepest ties are to several organizations that have agents in Kintargo working to keep the negative influences of Cheliax out.One such organization is the Cagebreakers, agents of chaos devoted overcoming tyrrany. Though them Sera and Erin have learned to channel the raw, chaotic power of the elements through their strikes. Though other Cagebreakers on the ground in Kintargo are few and far in between, some might be able to get word out to someone bigger (or badder, Cagebreakers aren't picky about the sorts they recruit, just that they want to bring down The Man), or point the way to a long disused cache of equipment. Or a storage locker full of crap no one cares about. Same thing, really.The pair also have ties to the Empyrean Guardians, a group that seeks to defend the innocent from those who would bring them harm. The Guardian Order are the ones that instructed the pair in the way of the Warder, as well as teaching them the Silver Crane discipline, allowing them to draw strength from blows dealt against the darkness to heal the wounds of the light.Though for the most part the Empyreal Guardians usually present in Kintargo have left to take part in the Glorious Reclamation, battling the wickedness of Cheliax on a grand scale, the people that they have aided may perhaps return the kindness of the defenders of the light.On one of the pair's adventures they did a service for a dwarf, rescuing his bard friend from a once magically sealed tower that had been recently re-opened to the world.Defeating a motley crew of Troglodytes with several other adventurers, the duo made acquaintances with a rogue named Martin, a Dragonborn sorcerer who introduced them to her family, and the dwarf and bard themselves."9/17/2017 21:27:49,Felleran Nefzen,Undead,Lich,"Felleran was once a Red Wizard of Thay, the ruling class of a proud nation fluent in powerful magicks, but in a deal with Szass Tam, he presented his own body to go through lichdom, and become an undead creature to continue with his devious plans.

The third son of four in a middle class family, he didn't stand out. He got a partial scholarship for school, but it ran out and he was forced to search for an apprenticeship. The only arrangement he could get was more like indentured servitude. His new master separated him from his family and his few friends. The youth's curiosity and eagerness to make something of himself were all that sustained him. Early on, his studies continued almost as they had at university. Eventually, however, his master began to berate him for having only middling intellect and talent. His lessons became shorter and less frequent, and his days were filled with drudgery. His master took on other students, from wealthier families; smarter men and women who lived up to his strict expectations. They were allowed into the master's lab, when re he conducted secret research. Finally, when the student become servant had given up hope of being a doctor, the master invited him into the secret lab. Here, the master conducted experiments aimed at achieving takwiin, the creation of artificial life. Instead of being allowed to help conduct these experiments... The former student became a subject. With the help of advanced healing magic, he was kept alive and conscious as he was dissected and put back together, over and over, until the master believed he fully understood the mechanisms of life. Then, the subject was taken apart one final time. It took months, for the master went much slower this time. Each piece of the subject was removed, labeled, preserved, and used as a model to create an artificial replica. Then the new piece was attached. Piece by piece, the subject was disassembled and remade, aware the whole time. There are no words in any language, save perhaps infernal, to describe the pain. He begged every day, or at least every day that he had a mouth to beg, for the torment to end. The master was cold and unyielding in his amoral scientific fervor, but the other students left, one by one, and never returned. The doctor was left alone with his creation. Towards the end of the process, one other person did appear. The haze of pain masked their appearance and their words to the subject, but their purpose would become clear in hindsight. In fact, it would become nearly all-consuming. On the final day, the subject's pain faded, leaving him clear-headed and... Whole. Intact for the first time in what seemed like a century, but couldn't have been much more than a year. The master was there, looking at him, scrutinizing him with dispassionate eyes. The master said""Your name is Victor, and you have been given a purpose. Kill the High Inquisitor. You have been created for this reason, and no other. You have been given the tools and skills you will need to accomplish this task, and no more. Your name is Victor, and you have been given a purpose. Kill...""No more words reached Victor. Information flooded his brain. How to pick a lock. How to kill a man with a crossbow bolt from fifty paces. How to remain unseen. How to create deadly poisons. False memories also jostled for space inside his skull. They threatened to erase any remaining traces of that old, unfamiliar life that someone else had lived in another body. When Victor was again aware of his surroundings, the master was gone. The room was empty. Victor hesitantly stood, testing the leather, wood, and steel that now made up most of his body. He walked through an archway into the room beyond, and found a low bench with clothing and a pack on it, as well as weapons. To the side was a mirror that reached floor to ceiling. Victor stared. He saw a naked man, short and slim, with skin the color of well worn leather or waxed mahogany. A seam ran down his chest, starting at the base of his throat and ending at his navel, and inside he saw gears, shafts, dials, and wires. In the center of his chest, nestled among the machinery, glowed a red crystal shaped like a heart, with perfectly chiseled chambers and valves. Victor tore his eyes away, and quickly fastened the opening shut with implanted reflexes. He turned to the clothing and gear, and meticulously equipped himself. Then he left. A purpose burned in his heart: he was going to kill the High Inquisitor--it was what he was made to do."9/17/2017 23:34:36,Delnita Frenbell,Warforged,Sorceror,"Delnita's life has been sharply split into ""before"" and ""after."" The ""before"" is hazy, but she recalls a life as an ambitious Gnome mechanic in Redair.  There was a promising career, a stable relationship with her husband, as well as three precocious children.  She feels it was a good life, but dislikes dwelling on those memories.  Their inconsistancy discomfits her.  Sometimes there's clarity: she'll recall with exacting detail how she completed a contract to outfit a machinist's bench lathe with a multi-step cone pulley system.  Then, upon deeper reflection, she realizes that she cannot recall her wedding or the sound of her own daughter's voice.The ""after"" began the day she awoke in darkness, completely entrapped, unable to move or breath and yet not suffocating.  Struggling proved fruitless, but her cries for help rang clear despite her inability to breath.  Her restraint was soon released by a half-orc woman crowbarring the lid to her transport crate open, drawn by the muffled noise from within.  Unfortunately, and to Delnita's great surprise, her struggles manifested as an eruption of arcane lightning from her hand as the lid was opened.  The half-orc took the brunt, laying her out flat on the floor as Delnita stared at the unfamiliar hand in front of her.This racket drew a middle-aged human man, whose reaction to seeing the smoking, prone woman was to pull a pistol on Delnita. The ensuing standoff didn't last long, as Delnita's panicked feminine voice gave him pause, along with the half-orc's strained insistance that she was merely singed.  All parties soon realized their confusion was mutual, with Delnita particularly befuddled by the foreign metal body she was inhabiting.Once all calmed enough for conversation, the human introduced himself as Myrten, and the half-orc as his wife, Gortence.  He explained that they had purchased the mechanical body Delnita found herself in as part of a recent transaction, pointing out its intriguing features: the pristine condition despite signs of age, strange runes inscribed along her joints, and the huge citrine crystal imbedded in her palm.  They, of course, were eager to know who Delnita was and why she was inhabiting their new purchase. But, searching her memory yielded nothing, and discussion of her most recent memories as a gnome revealed that more then a year had passed since her last recollection.This was the beginning of what turned into a long relationship between the three.  She began doing odd jobs for the couple in exchange for using their warehouse space, and quickly became a full time employee for a minimal salary.  Myrten and Gortence expressed no desire to claim ownership of Delnita after discovering her sentience, and offered her higher rates, but she felt indebted to them after learning what they had spent to purchase her.  Her current body didn't need to eat, anyway, which made budgeting fairly easy.For the following year, Delnita tirelessly delved for clues, quite literally as her new body required a scant four hours of rest each day.  She methodically scoured Redair, from it's booming tech scene to its criminal elements, reactions to her form ranging from curiousity to disgust to avarice.  This only brought dead end after dead end.  Even the information on her receipt of purchase proved false, her seller vanished, with even her employers able to locate them again.  Her one certainty was that she was an anomaly: no arcane or technological expert she questioned had ever seen anything like her.Throughout this, Delnita considered seeking her family, but always resolved to address her current predicament first. She knew her career wasn't waiting for her: arcane monstrosities were not looked upon kindly in Redair's tech focused community.  And besides, her finances would assure her family's comfort in the meantime.  And, more concerningly, she found herself unsettlingly disconnected from her prior life, as if she was an observer rather than a participant.  Unsure how confronting them now would impact her or them, she concluded that nothing good would come from a reunion before regaining herself.Now, she feels her best chance of doing so is to learn more about this construct she inhabits.  Unravelling its secrets could provide clues about happened to her organic body, could help her restore her memories, and perhaps even return her organic form.  Tired of being stonewalled in Redair by the disdain for sullying technology with the arcane, she now reluctantly finds herself bound for Naurecht to continue her research.  While she had previously shared that disdain for unpredictable magic, she cannot deny her body is a conduit for it, and she doubts she'll get answers without embracing it."9/18/2017 5:09:14,Tower,Warforged (robot),Monk,"When his master's castle fell in the war, his high lord used his own children as human shields.

I’ve been in the southern border guarding against orcs for the past few summers.  I’m not sure what they want, but it does require me to go into the village which I prefer not to do.-	They are sending me on a mission.  I am going to be working with the Montinubris Military to protect our interests.  To this end I received a bag of holding and a few other items that may or may not be useful.  I also have a list of magical items to watch for and hopefully return with so the mages can study them further or try to duplicate them.  Forrest Storm said ”It’s time to stop hiding and find your own path.  There is a huge world out there waiting for you.   It’s time to find your answers there.”-	I arrived in town today.  I met my contact and was told that I would be a consultant with the military group.  There is something going on on one of the outlaying plantations that they require assistance with.  Apparently they have loosed a nightmare creature of some sort that is wreaking havoc with the commoners.-	We came to the plantation yesterday.  There is some sort of trial going on.  Some fighter beat the crap out of several guards and got caught.  Where and why was not mentioned. I’m going to try to find a place to work out before I go stir crazy.  This whole area is barren.  Oh, how I miss my forrest with huge trees and lively animals to talk to. I’m staying in the plantation house as there are not exactly alot of females and they have no place else to put me.   As if females are not twice the fighters males are!-	I had a fairly good work out in the workout area.  The commoners must really be leary of fighters as the practice area is far outside of the main plantation area.  I was approached by Grok, one of the other fighters and he requested to spar with me.   We are fairly evenly matched so it was a good workout.  He did try to disarm me and got punched for his efforts though.-	Today we rode out to a cave system that was recently opened and is believed to be the origin of the creature/s.  There is writing on the cave that I can’t quite make out other than sealed, Master of Shadows, and MARKELL.  I get the feeling that this place was sealed for a good reason and it was NOT supposed to be reopened.  2 rangers have disappeared w/i it’s depths already.  The very air reeks of evil near the entrance.  May the Goddess of the Woodlands protect me in this alien place.-	We entered the cave late this morning.  It was dark and dank.  We followed Jumper, the halfling, as he is the trap expert.  We found the remnants of a bar that was apparently cursed.  It was almost stopped in time.  The remains of 3 cages were also found, torn apart from the inside out.  There was more writing on the walls that appeared the same as the wall outside.  I couldn’t make out anything else though.  The fighter Grok asked what I was reading and when I told him he dropped like a stone.  We took him back outside to help revive him.  After he woke up he told me of his strange dreams he’s been having.  They appear to be closely related to whatever is happening here.  The bodies of the missing rangers were found torn limb from limb in the back of the bar.  There was no blood anywhere.  I don’t know what type of creature did this, but it is undeniably evil.-	By the time we roused Grok it was starting to get dark so we decided to continue our cave explorations in the morning.   Then the alarm went up from the main plantation in the distance.  The entire party rushed back and we found another victim behind the house.  It was obvious that whatever was in the cave had escaped.  I tracked it to the edge of shadows and the tracks just disappeared.  Then I heard the comment that ”It can’t just disappear, it must be in the ground”.   Next thing I knew the creature exploded up out of the earth.   It vaguely resembled a troll w/ metal of some  sort running thru it’s body.   I got the first shot in and hurt it.   Grok threw his weapon at it and missed the thing completely.  His weapon struck the party leader in the shoulder instead.  I hit the thing right in the privates and it went back into the earth.  The cleric said a spell and sank  his sword into the earth where it disappeared.  It came boiling out of the earth again and it looked like it had started to heal itself.  I got it again, immobilizing one hand and the halfling immobilized the other.  Someone else hit it and it howled and turned to ashes.  I hope this is the last I’ve seen of these creatures. -	Father Collins said that this is probably one of three creatures beleived to have escaped from the cave.   So we have at least 2 more to go.-	When we went back to the house Bobbi went in the wrong door and got tripped over by a huge cook who was carrying a large, boiling hot pot of soup.  He was immediatly drenched with turnip soup.  He yelled and took off down the hall at a rapid rate.  Tolir was royally pissed and called the guards.  Bobbi bounced off the wall and went back the way he came.  He was snatched and held aloft by the guard.  Tolir’s daughter intervened for him and Tolir agreed not to harm Bobbi.  Bobbi was taken to the bunkhouse and the guards were told not to let him out again.  -	I decided to try and find a library but was told the lord was particular about who went in there.  Instead I decided to wander in the hopes that I could locate another creature.  I located Grath and he agreed to accompany me.  We found Bobbi sneaking around outside and Grath started to haul him in but Bobbi offered him a Fairy drink and Grath forgot all about a possible bounty and joined him for a drink instead.  Then they turned around and followed me.  Bobbi  got a bright idea and decided to try and summon the creature.  The first time he was successful I got the creature in the hand, after which it sank back into the earth.  The second time it didn’t materialize enough for me to hurt it, but it began to hunt Bobbi. he ran for the bunkhouse and exploded out the back as it gave chase.   Bobbi did some sort of spell and grass started sprouting from the monster’s mound.  I noticed that the creature left a trail of coal black ashes, before it was changed to grass that is.  I may be able to track this thing after all.  Bobbi  decided to drop the cup he used for summoning and it was swallowed by the grass mound chasing him.  The mound then spread thru-out the field, I searched the area but I didn’t see anyplace where it led out of the field.  Father Collins couldn’t raise it again and Bobbi passed out from spellcasting.  I told the guards to post a perimeter guard and I climbed a nearby tree and got some sleep.-	After breakfast Bobbi tried to raise it again, unsuccessfully.  I asked Father Collins to try to raise it and he was unsuccessful as well.  An hour or so later Bobbi  got one to drop from the sky, it was definately dead but I’m not sure if it was the same creature as before or not.  -	Tolir gave me permission to go thru his library as long as I’m accompanied by a guard at all times.  He seemed rather surprised that I could read.  I don’t think he realizes that I’m a couple of centuries older than he is.  There wasn’t a whole lot of useful information there, but I did find a rather interesting book on land deeds and such for the local area though.  It seems that Tolir has managed to acquire most of the property around.  That reminded me of the note I got from Bobbi last night and I pulled it out.  According to that letter, Tolir is making treaties with his neighbors independent of the King, and not necessarily good for his health either.  I will definately be keeping my eyes open for further evidence though.  What I have now is just enough to get me hung.  I’m glad I’m writing this in slyvan!!-	When I left the library I was just in time to join Jumper and Tolir on a return trip to the caves.  I noticed the stones around one of the cages is marked with the light symbol in draconic, apparently it was part of what was keeping one of the creatures caged.  The cages were of interesting construction though.  One was made of glass, one of metal and the last was made of stone.  The stone one is the one that is ringed by the stones.  I would deduce that they were specially made to contain the creatures that the mage was trying to create.  There is no way tell exactly how old they are but I would say very.  The metal is rusted and the stones of light were made by a high-level mage so could have been active for centuries at least.  The spell appears to be spent though, I wonder, do they only shine at night?  Could the sun’s presence be enough to contain that creature during the day, even underground?  What was finally strong enough to break the cages after so long a time?  Magic could have done it, after all there are spells to turn metal to rust and uncreate anything.  What mage around here is strong enough to overcome the original wards and why would they without firm control over the creatures released?  Were the creatures that escaped the originals or the offspring of the originals?  How does this tie into Tolir’s activities? Is he a mage or more likely, does he have one on his payroll?  I will have to make a point to come down here at night, as repellent as that thought is.  I can’t seem to make out anymore of the writing though.  It’s maddening, it looks like I should know it, but I can’t read it for anything!!  Grok started getting nervous and said he was ready to leave, cosidering what happened last time he came here I’m surprised he came back.  I really should find out if he’s dreamed anything else useful.  I decided to call it a early day and get some practice on the way back.  I’m going to try hunting these things at night tonight.  I’ll ask the rest of the guys who appear to be somewhat useful to come along as well.  Tolir’s not going to be one of them though.  His condescending attitude is starting to wear thin.  Especially considering I’m old enough to have bounced his GRANDFATHER on my knee!!!"9/18/2017 12:43:19,Eru,Wood Elf,Ranger,Outlander9/18/2017 9:03:54,Kopeiren Ëinfugen ,Wood elf,Bard,Became a hermit in order to master a musical instrument 9/18/2017 9:03:55,Kopeiren Ëinfugen ,Wood elf,Bard,Became a hermit in order to master a musical instrument 9/18/2017 20:39:34,Resinosa Silva,Wood Elf,Rogue,Ranger/scout who has been a mercenary for some years now. 9/18/2017 7:47:51,Belligrava 'Grav' Leguma,Wood Elf,Ranger,Stoner wood elf who lived in a turnip shed and was press-ganged into service by the local constabulary.9/17/2017 22:44:53,Reyna Meliosa,Wood Elf,Cleric,"Reyna started serving the Bitch Queen Umberlee after nearly dying in a multiple shipwrecks including the one that killed her parents, she's in love with Umberlee and Reyna is in love with her "9/18/2017 8:08:41,Ful'beracht Melouchevine,Wood Elf,Ranger,"Elven ranger, retired.

Before he left, however, he took the time to learn all that he could about the natural world - what plants could be eaten, how to track animals, where to find necessities - as he had been fascinated with nature even more than the average wood elf ever since he first saw its raw beauty. Once he felt he had traveled far enough, he made that place his home. He maintained a roof above his head and fashioned a mat for meditation. He used his knowledge of various types of woods to craft a bow to protect himself from predators. Slow to use it, however, he has his fair share of scars, most notably on his chest where he has four parallel scars from where a bear attacked him. After fending off the beast, he ran for shelter lest he encounter more hostile creatures. As he was fleeing, he stumbled upon a pool which was home to a nymph who called herself Maia and, sensing that he cared about nature as much as she did, took him in and cared for him while he healed. He learned much from her about nature along with her language, Sylvan. When he fully recovered, he decided that it was time to leave. As he was alone and received little education, he knew very little about the world outside of nature and had nothing to his name aside from what he made himself. Chimara was happy for nearly 100 years, but slowly he began to yearn for something different. He wanted to do something other than survive. He decided that he wanted to appreciate nature the way it was intended to be enjoyed - with an adventure. He left his home at the age of 125 and headed for civilization. It was there that he first heard about the druids and the power they wield. He sought out a teacher and began to learn the ways of the druids."9/18/2017 11:23:32,Kvothe,Wood elf,Druid,"Outlander,     Kvothe was born in a small nomadic tribe of druids that wandered the forests around Gilidaran. Sometimes trading with the city when nature could not provide. All children of the tribe are taught the ways of nature and magic. Kvothe's first couple of decades were full of learning the ways of the druids. It can be lonely for a children in the tribe as elves don't have children as often as their human counter parts. From a young age Kvothe showed a very keen interest in nature and animals, however he did not seem to pay much heed to the other members of the tribe. As soon as he was able to walk he would wander off into the woods for hours and when asked where he had been he would always say “with his friends”.     Kvothe showed an incredible aptitude towards the wild shape and communing with nature, however he showed very little interest in elemental magic or some of the higher rituals of the tribe. When he reached the age of maturity he was to be put through the tribes coming of age test to prove that he would be a valued member of the tribe. The test consisted of the tribe member being sent out into the woods for a month to survive and better learn the ways of the wild it was not unheard of for children to never come back alive. That was no such issue for Kvothe after the first week he found that he preferred the woods to tribe life and at the end of the month when it was time for him to return he decided he did not want to go back.     After he had made his decision, he left the tribes normal paths and went deeper and farther away from the city than his tribe ever ventured. He survived off the land and defended it from hunters and more, only killing animals or harming plants if necessary for survival. Whenever he killed an animal he would make use of everything or else hang on to it until he could find someone who could. Only seeking others when he had stuff to trade. He mastered his woodcraft over decades and became one with the animals and nature.  He talks to himself and his only companion, Ash, all the time and doesn't have the best of manners    About ten years ago he found a very strange bird that looked like a hawk but was the wrong color instead of the brown and tan colors that he had seen in his travels, it was black with bits of gray along its wings and underside. It had been abandoned by its parents and was near death. He nursed it back to health and the bird ,which he named ash, has been with him ever since.     Recently the animals and plants in his domain have been acting strangely and seem to be heading away from the big city near his birth tribe. He decided that it may be time to return to society and find out what was going on..."9/18/2017 11:55:10,Aria,Wood Elf,Druid,"	Aria had always been a bit of a loner, but that didn’t make it easier. Perhaps that’s why she felt sorry for the baby owl that laid at her feet. It had tried to fly too soon, or fallen from its nest, and had hurt its wing in the process. Too much too soon. How very familiar. Aria was a wood elf from a small tribe, not that she remembered much about her upbringing. Aria had gotten separated from her family when she was small. It had only been fifty years ago, at the beginning of the Laconian Expansion wars. She had been a child by elven standards, and still was to some degree. She was nearing the turn of her first century, a landmark occasion that would normally be celebrated by the whole tribe. She scooped up the baby owl. Maybe they could make a new tribe. 	The Expansion wars had not been particularly brutal on the Wood Elves, they had quickly brought an end to the war once they became involved. Yet the initial Laconian assault had taken the elves off-guard. The villages closest to the border were hit hard. Aria was in one of those villages. She remembered the fires, licking high above the tree tops. A scout returned, saying that the humans had come and it was time to retreat deeper into the forest. Aria now knew the wisdom of this, they would retreat and regroup with a larger force in order to take the attack back to the humans. In the moment, she hadn’t even stopped to think. Aria grabbed her bow and rushed through the flames. She was young, but had always been talented surely she could handle what the others were too afraid to fight. There were multiple bands of human skirmishers, about a hundred soldiers in all. They were probably scouting out any Wood elf defenses, not that her people ever maintained defenses in peacetime. Aria loosed arrow after arrow into the soldiers, her face twisted in pain. She was filled with so much rage, that they would come into her home and cause such wanton destruction. She reached back for another arrow but her quiver was empty. Only then did she see the already cold faces of those she’d slain, and the horde of men rushing at her. She retched. Then she ran. She ran fast, faster than her pursuers, faster than the flames. Like a leaf on a winter wind, flying furiously to no where in particular but always away. When night finally fell she stopped, tears streaming from her eyes as she panted.	That was a hard night, but she woke with clear eyes. She made arrows, got some food and set about making her camp livable. She spent a few months simply surviving in her little patch of woods, away from the war. She built a simple hut and lived a simple life. One day while Aria was smoking a rabbit, three Wood Elves appeared at the edge of her copse. They had smelled her cooking and came to investigate. Aria had never seen Wood Elves in armor, but these were wearing a livery that made them look like the most elegant soldiers she could have imagined. She of course invited them to share the rabbit, which they happily accepted. The soldiers told her that they were captains moving to the front lines, having been sent by the King in the Wood to oversee a few important battles. Aria perked up at this. She had put the war out of her mind after that first night, but she still felt like she should help her people. And who better to escort her to the front lines than these dashing elf captains? Aria gave them a quick rundown of her story, at which several eyebrows were raised, and asked to journey with them to where the fighting was. The captains had evidently heard of some fey elf maid whom was the first elf to slay a human in the conflict and were quite delighted to make her acquaintance. With enthusiasm they agreed to accompany her south. 	In the following two years Aria distinguished herself among the elves and struck fear into the hearts of many Laconians. Her arrows flew like winged death and she was fair with a blade as well. During the years of the war, and in the years since, Aria had inquired everywhere about her tribe. No one had heard of the Coopers and didn’t know where they could be found. Everyone knew the border tribes had faired poorly in the first assault on the Great Wood. At the close of the war Aria went back to where it all started. She waited for weeks in the spot she had grown up. The old forest was gone. Meadow grass now pushed through the ashes. No one ever came back.	Aria went back to her little hut in the woods, which was now quite dilapidated. There, near the buckling entrance, she had found the little owl. It didn’t take long for her to fix his wing and it didn’t take long for him to cozy up to her. She would call him Artemis and they would live in this patch of forest. Maybe she could build a treehouse so he would feel at home. Here they could have a simple life. She could harvest and hunt…maybe even take the odd mercenary job. They could have a simple life, punctuated with adventure. They could make a new family.

His keen grey eyes scan the horizon as he strokes his long brown beard. Several glowing blue fibers, enchanted to pulse in-tune with his mood, are woven through the braided facial hair. The light glints off the polished green stone, carved in the shape of an eel eating its own tail, that hangs from a leather cord around the dwarf’s neck. The dwarf stinks of seaweed, and his smile is always a moment away from turning to an dark, unnerving leer. This is Gabbro Eelstooth, a dwarf hunted by his own people--with good reason.On board the Erasmus, Gabbro is always looking for something. Every spout of a distant leviathan or strangely-shaped piece of driftwood gives him momentary hope that he’s found some trace—any trace—of the wreck of the Serpentine. He knows that from the surface, such clues would be impossibly unlikely, but that hasn’t stopped him from looking.Until recently, Gabbro was a sailor on the Bloodstone, a submarine pirate ship crewed almost entirely by his clanmates. All ships were fair game for this gang of pirates: gnoll ships they sank could be cashed in for bounties, while elven vessels were usually loaded with precious metals and bizarre magical artifacts to sell. But after decades of piracy, the captain on the Bloodstone became obsessed with a legend: the rumored sunken treasure of the Serpentine.The Serpentine, the legends said, was a merchant vessel travelling between the Dwarven seamounts and the cities of the elves. On its last voyage, it was laden with gifts for the elves—as well as a great Dwarven mechanic and his most prized inventions: compasses which resisted confounding magical effects, goggles which let the wearer see through the thickest fog, astronomical clocks which tracked the movements of the heavens and the other planes, automatons which could see and think for themselves, and more—and all without any magic at all. But the ship was sunk, though the legends vary as to why. Whoever claimed those ruins would be absolved of all crimes by any Dwarven government, and lauded as heros.After three years of searching based only on hearsay, the crew grew weary. Their supplies were running low and the Bloodstone badly needed some time in dry dock. After a dive in which the captain refused to surface for air for so long that a cabin-boy died of suffocation, the crew mutinied. The gun-battle on board pierced the hull of the Bloodstone in several places. The ship was several hundred feet deep at the time, and as water poured in and the hull groaned under the strain, the mutineers claimed all the lifeboats, leaving the captain to be drowned and crushed at the bottom of the sea.The lifeboats clung together at first, bobbing on the surface like a raft of sea otters. But the crew grew quarrelsome, each claiming that if he had been in charge, they’d have found the treasure months ago. The arguments grew and grew until the raft broke apart and scattered, the dwarves still screaming at each other that by the Gods, they’d find the treasure first!Gabbro’s boat washed ashore at a small island port, where he spent a week wandering from inn to inn, drinking away what little money he had on him and thinking hard about what to do. None of the crew were the bookish types, Gabbro reasoned—if he could find a map, or even a scholar who knew the location of a map, he could go on a lot less than tall tales told in taverns. So he booked passage for the great city of Thasym, hoping to find some clue to work from.Gabbro emits an air of ill repute; he’s a self-serving bully even at the best of times. But without a crew to back him up, he’d never openly admit he was a pirate unless he felt it benefited him—nor would he reveal his mission, for fear that somebody else would get to any map before he did. If asked about his past (including by Captain Mantor) he weaves a sob story about how his fishing ship was attacked and sunk by goblins, and he’s going to Thasym to petition his rich uncle for a loan to buy a new one. Gabbro is driven to find this treasure—but not so driven that he won’t jump at an opportunity for more short-term profit first. If two years of searching didn’t find the Serpentine, he reasons, another month or two of delay won’t let his former crewmates get too big of an advantage. And the more money he has when he starts the search in earnest, the better a ship he can charter or purchase. Still, he is wary of delaying too long: rumor has reached him that others from his clan--not just the pirates--have put a bounty on his head. He's not entirely sure why... but whatever the reason is, it's probably justified.The Eelstooth clan, from which many pirates and thieves are derived, uses the bioluminescent beard-decorations as its signature adornment. As such, they’re often known derogatorily as “glowbeards.” Unless it’s an obvious mistake, and possibly even then, Gabbro will attempt to outright murder anyone who calls him that."9/18/2017 21:15:49,Lordani,Tiefling,Paladin,"She was made orphan by a war at an early age, and without many choices, enlisted herself.

"9/18/2017 21:35:36,Cassandra,Human,Bard,"	Cassandra was born, under another name, to a family of moderate spirits and low ambitions. For eight generations, they owned the same farm. And from generation to generation, the ownership passed the same way—father to eldest son. Cassandra was born the eldest son of the family, and for years, was told she would inherit the farm when she grew older and took a wife. Despite ambitions loftier than anyone in the previous eight generations, she put her back into the work, and dedicated herself to making her father proud. Undeniably, he was. She had a knack for her work in the field, and seemed, by all accounts, well-suited to it. However, she never felt any particular passion in the work, nor fondness for her father. By the age of eight, she had learned, rather, that she found more joy in shared activities with her mother. She would help with the housework whenever she could, as exhausted from the fields as she was. Her mother found this trait endearing. Her father, not so much. She, herself, couldn’t fathom what compelled her to the tasks until, at the age of eleven, she was separated from her father during a trip into the market, and found herself in an unfamiliar part of town, where she was greeted by a woman she didn’t recognize. In a masculine voice, the woman asked Cassandra, “Are you lost?”. She could only nervously stutter out a yes, and after a bit of calming down, the woman introduced herself as Elise. Cassandra, with childish curiousity, asked if she was a man or a woman, and Elise gave only a chuckle, and a short explanation, that she had been born a man, but came to see herself otherwise as she grew. When Elise eventually found Cassandra’s father and returned her, he didn’t give a thanks, but only a curt harrumph as he lead Cassandra away. But the memory of Elise stuck in her head long after, and by the end of the month, she couldn’t keep her thoughts to herself any longer. When she told her mom, she simply froze up and said to talk to dad. The very next day, while working in the field, she jammed her hoe in the ground, leaned on it to catch a breath, and spoke, spilling everything to him. What she had learned from Elise, the pain she’d been feeling, how she believed she was like the woman she met. Her dad only scoffed, and spoke down to her, ending the conversation with only, “You’ve got a pair of balls, boy. You’re a man, plain and simple. Don’t try and get out of a man’s work.” From then on, she was no longer allowed to do housework, and would be doubling down on work in the field, to ensure that she doesn’t “forget herself”. Any time she raised a fuss, her father reminded her of that same lesson as the first day. This treatment continued until she was 13, at which point she could stand it no longer.	Furious and dysphoric, she sneaked out her window late one night, and to the stable, where she found the surgical tools for the horses. Under the cover of darkness, she stuffed a rolled-up tunic between her teeth, and got to work, barely controlling her screams as she worked. It took nearly an hour, and by the end, she was bleary with blood loss, but at long last, it was done. Her testes, which had caused her so much sorrow for so long, were finally gone, and at last, she could be who she knew she was all along. At last, her father could accept her. However, when he found the bloodied tools, his reaction was nothing like what she had hoped. She explained herself—that she didn’t have balls anymore, that she could be a woman now. But instead of acceptance, he was furious at her. She could no longer inherit the farm. No longer have sons to help in the fields. Before the crack of dawn, he drove her out, away from the farm, and into the nearby woods. Mutilated, still recovering from her impromptu surgery, and broken with sorrow, it was in these woods that, when exposure and the animals would not take her life, she considered doing it herself. But rather, she survived. She found the road. Followed it to the large market town she remembered from her childhood. In the evening, she reached the gates, and by nightfall, she had got herself a humble meal with her small sum of silver she had stolen before she was driven away, and found a gutter to rest in. At first, she wept. Her life was over. There was nothing left for her. The destiny laid out for her had been quashed. The person she wished to be would never come to fruition. It was all too much for her. She wept, and wept, and wept, until she could take weeping no more, and instead chose to sing her lamenting. She sang the songs she remembered from the field, first quietly, then louder, and louder, and louder still, through her tears, until she had become so utterly enraptured by her own voice that she barely even noticed when a wealthy traveller tossed a gold coin at her feet. A gold coin, she thought, her eyes fixating on the sparkle of the metal. This was a greater sum than she had ever possessed for herself. With this alone, she could get herself a room for the night, somewhere warm, a hot meal in the morning. A few more, and maybe she could even get herself clothes to look like one of those wealthy merchants herself. Perhaps, she would get herself a nice dress to wear. That would do nicely, she thought, as she sang all through the evening, until there were no more common folk walking the streets, and with the moderate sum of copper, silver, and gold she had earned, slept comfortably for the night.	Days passed, and she became ever more fascinated with the way her voice had changed since her self-inflicted surgery. It was sweeter. Gentler. Less resonant, but more touching. She practiced with it day in and day out, sharpening it like a blade, performing until her throat was as dry as a desert, and then spending the money on drinks to quench her thirst so she could continue. As her income grew, she was able to spend it on more extravagant clothing, more dazzling makeup, until she was no longer known as “the boy in a dress”, and rather, as “The Golden Voice on Smith Street”. Day in, day out, she sang. As the shops closed for the evening, she would begin to draw a crowd, and it wasn’t long before the inn she was staying at began offering her gigs as an entertainer in exchange for a free room and meals. Two years passed, and life grew easier for her. So much so that it had almost grown boring. The city life did not amuse her. It only sustained her. She met many people, some like herself, others not so much. Yet despite being an entertainer, she never felt that she, herself, was entertained. She yearned for excitement. For adventure. Fortunately for her, it was coming to find her. One of very few times she had her gig at the inn cancelled, she learned it was because of a minstrel group coming in, one which, supposedly, the innkeeper was especially fond of. They called themselves the World’s Widows, and were a group of musicians who wrote songs about a subject that most wouldn’t dare breathe a word about: heroic women. Intrigued, Cassandra sat in for the performance, knowing she had more than enough coin saved to survive a night off. The World’s Widows sang well through the evening, about tales of ladies dressing as men to go into battle, of women carrying their children out of disasters, then going back in to save others, standing up for their beliefs even in the face of tribulation or execution. She was intrigued with every single story. All around her though, the patrons seemed enraptured by the music, but utterly indifferent to the content. That is, until they began their last act, a song about a woman general who lead her men into victory. At this, some in the tavern began to boo, and demand that they stop the song and get off the stage. Still, they sang, even as it looked as though the crowd would rush the stage. In a moment of pure spontaneity, Cassandra stood up, and in her most powerful voice, joined in the chorus with the World’s Widows. As her voice echoed in the hall, those in audience were soothed, in awe, and sat back down, allowing the performance to continue, only to eventually cheer. After the show, the World’s Widows caught up with her, and she was invited to join them. After many fond farewells, and reminders from the barkeep that she could return if she so desired, she finally accepted their offer. The very next morning, they departed, and she began her life as a travelling minstrel. Among the World’s Widows, there were no rulers, and rather, matters were typically voted upon or debated, but the majority of time was spent travelling, drinking, and writing music. In every town they passed through, they would seek out women of great deeds to write their songs about. A favourite, for them, was of tales of ladies who disguised themselves as knights to go into battle. Cassandra shared this sentiment about such stories, and never tired of hearing them retold. But what she had not expected was that, not only did the minstrels tell the tales of heroic women. They lived them, as well. Through the World’s Widows, she was trained with blades and bows alike, taught to defend herself on the road. Taught to harness her voice into a potent form of magic. And with them, she felt as though she could rule the world.	She quickly found a place for herself among the World’s Widows, relating to their many stories. When asked about her past, she had already formed a perfect story—not a lie, but not the whole truth either: her father, not wanting a daughter, drove her off the farm, and she’d been living on the streets since, surviving by virtue of her voice. The rest of the minstrels took quickly to her, with the exception of one Theresa, a specialist in the lute, who was not so easily swayed. Within the group, they became somewhat of a pair of rivals, with Cassandra’s swelling pride causing competition and contention between them. At 14, Cassandra was the youngest member of the group, and the honour of having been accepted had gone heavily to her head, causing her to frequently egg Theresa on. The rivalry persisted, and though, in many cases, it only served to intensify their shared passion for the work, it only took a year for the arrangement to finally come to a head. In the midst of a high-profile performance, Theresa began her lute solo. Cassandra, however, cut the solo off early to begin singing again. As a result, Theresa began to play more loudly to try and drown her out. This exchange of one-upmanship continued throughout the performance until they broke into a full-on physical fight and the whole group had to be dragged out of the bar. It was that night that the World’s Widows agreed the two of them would have to settle their differences before either could be allowed on stage again. It was also that night when, after the performance, Cassandra was changing in her room, and Theresa came in unexpectedly. Seeing Cassandra naked, Theresa accused her of being a man pretending to be a woman. Before Cassandra could explain, Theresa ran off to the others and told them everything. By a majority vote, Cassandra was cast out of the World’s Widows, and left to fend for herself. In desperation, she returned to the inn where she had first begun performing, only to find her spot taken by another singer, and be unrecognized by the bartender. Having lost the spirit to try and go in and prove herself again, Cassandra moved on, drifting from city to city, singing her sorrows in the streets to get her meals, hoping against hope that she would one day get an opportunity to reclaim her honour. As she wandered, she practiced. She honed her skills with the bow. She wove her voice into more and more potent magicks. And she prepared herself for danger, with the styles taught to her by the World’s Widows. Years of folk heroism prepared her for the moment when she received her summons to Navrim, to fight on behalf of the lords of the realm. And so, she set off, in hopes of becoming a hero worthy of the songs of the World’s Widows, to take her place among legends."9/18/2017 21:44:06,Ugg,Half orc,Monk,Mount named LEE9/18/2017 21:51:03,Trakul Rubymace,Dwarf,Bard,"Trakul grew up as heir to the throne of an ancient dwarven kingdom. He was expected to study in many fields of knowledge, and while he was competent at fighting, he was far more interested in craftmanship and history. He became obsessed with old songs about his ancestors, the magic they wielded, and the adventures they went on. He started studying music and magic as much as he could, but his royal duties kept him from it. One day, his father asked him to lead an attack force against a group of orcs that had infested one of their deeper gem mines. It was nearly a failure, and the only reason the orcs were removed from the mine was the result of Trakul's father taking over at the last minute. Trakul was stripped of his royal title and cast out in disgrace, so he took the opportunity to study music and magic further. He made his way out of the mountains to a deep forest, where he came across a clan of elves. They initially wanted to reject him, but their royal bard took pity on Trakul and took him in. He trained with the royal bard for years, perfecting his craft by learning the lyre, learning musical spells, and ancient songs and tales of adventure. He also learned how to be a damn good entertainer as well. When Trakul left, his mentor gave him a magic lyre, a book of spells, and a word of advice: ""Be friendly to everyone, but trust no one."" Trakul made a living as a traveling musician for a few years, but yearned to learn more songs. However, he could not find any, so he decided to write some of his own. For inspiration, he traveled with a group of adventurers and wrote songs about their exploits. He had to do a fair bit of adventuring himself, though, and he quickly acquired a taste for death-defying treasure hunts. So, as well as being a musician, he became an adventure-seeker as well."9/18/2017 22:00:12,Ramakidin,Human,Wizard,"Ramakidin started life in a the back alley childhood gang known as the Noon-Shadows.

Well known for being near the ocean and its gunsmiths. Because of this many gunslingers, hunters, pirates, and gun enthusiasts often visit or take residence in the local area. Not like it matters that much. Ohara has been gone for 10 whole years._	_She could still remember the night the barony burned to the ground. People either crying in pain or running away. Others trying to fend… them off. Blood spilling all over. Gunshots and cannon fire. Screaming… Braying… it felt endless. She could still hear the ring of the church bells above her slowly die off, as if the heart of the city has failed. 	It was supposed to be just a “simple wedding”… that’s what she called it. Few months before, she met a famous gunslinger, John D. Smith. At first they would just see each other every now and then. She only started getting to know him when she said that she wanted to learn about guns. How to make them, how to use them. John taught her everything she knows. Eventually lessons turned into just meetings, where they talked for hours about anything. Who they were, who they want to be. What the future had in store for them. John said if there ever was a chance to give up the gun he wanted to dance and sing. Fiona could’ve gone on forever thinking about him.The way he would smile his crooked but perfect smile. How his ears twitched when she called his name. How his hands were funnily unbelievably small despite being able to handle a gun. How he knew how to do practically everything. How he later revealed that he actually never watched a theatre play in his life. Fionna promised that she would take him to see one someday… His code of honour.“Every gunslingers got to have a code, see?” “Why’s that?”“Fuck if I know, but it sounds cool to have one right?”She laughed. “Sure it is. So what’s yours?”“I’ll tell ya, but first there’s something I gotta do.”Fionna just wanted a simple wedding. But John and her father Ogar had a different idea. A Supreme Wedding with Amazingness and Maximum Pantomime. SWAMP for short.“That sounds stupid.” Fiona said. John thought differently.“Hey, at least we can say things like ‘This is our SWAMP now!’”“The hell is that supposed to mean?” John ignored her.“Or if someone barges in, breaks through the window on a dragon-tries to stop it- I can say ‘Git out of mah SWAMP’”“What are you guys even talking about…” But in the end she laughed and accepted it. Any type of ceremony was fine for her.The entire barony gathered at the church for their wedding. In retrospect Fionna guesses that’s the reason the barony got completely destroyed. No one guarding the entrances, or the ports…Everything was quiet. She was just staring into his eyes. Deeply listening to him say his vows, like someone in a theatre watching a play. Then suddenly it happened.The Braying… slowly increasing in volume. Loud enough to shake the church.Then suddenly the church doors were kicked down. In the distance Fionna could see hooves and hind legs where they used to be.And then a huge explosion. She blacked out.When she woke up everything went to hell. The church bells ringing. Blood covered the walls and floor. everyone in the church either died or just gone. Amongst it all were… them. Either clopping over people, alive or dead. Or eating the flesh off the people. She looked around. The bodies of her family laid lifeless. Seemed like the explosion killed them. She looked down and everything went silent. John was dead. His mouth smashed in, unable to smile anymore. In his cold, small hands laid his special gun, Griggs. Then something close by brayed loudly.The ministers body was chewed open. They were feasting on him like he was some field of grass. She went down to pick up the last piece of John she had left, ring glimmering in front of her.“Okay you did what you had to do, so what’s your code?”He kissed her. “Alright, there’s three tenets to my code.”“One: Always show courage in the face of danger.”She raised the gun, it was heavy but she knew how to use it.“Two: Never leave a comrade behind.”She looked back at John. Tears streaming down her face. She then wiped her eyes and aimed Griggs.“And three: Never let a donkey live.”"9/18/2017 22:05:04,Dungeona Dragonette,Tiefling,bard,"Dungeona was abandoned in an old wishing well as a child.

Und Oh bey~   “That’s a weird song yer singin’ miss.”“It is nothing but an old childhood song from my home.”   “Sounds kinda sad fer a children’s tune dontcha think?”“The only thing making this song sad is your perception.”   “Whatchu on about? Yer the one dats singin’ it ain’t ye?”   I pause. Thinking about my home, my family, and my sister.“Then again maybe the one making it sad is me.” I admit.   I smile, remembering a silly phrase my sister use to say to me so long ago.    —————————— It’s been about two years since I decided to leave Sapona. My sister, Loryal, and I were part ofthe royal family. From an outsiders perspective we look like the perfect family, however behind the castle walls was nothing but anger and sadness. When we weren’t outside our parents bombarded us with lessons, grooming us to be the perfect brides. When they weren’t teaching us my parents would constantly argue over which one of us would marry which noble in some other kingdom. It was frustrating... For our parents to only see us as objects for trade, as currency... It was saddening.“I don’t think they see us like that.” My sister would say, reassuringly. Then she would smile   “Maybe it’s just you.”   “Yeah maybe it’s me.” I would say halfheartedly.  ——————————Despite all that the lessons took its toll on us, and we coped with it in our own ways. My sister decided to dabble in thievery. Whenever she could she would sneak out and try to scale walls,   pickpocket the guards, or train with swords and bows in the barracks. Me, on the other hand, spent most of my free time in the royal library. Reading about heroes from faraway places,their adventures and endeavours, invigorated me. It sparks something in my soul. They were so different from me. Free from some pre-determined destiny laid out before them. Free from the confines of castle walls. These heroes... they were people! They were viewed as people and heroes. Unlike me, only seen as a princess or some trade goods.I also loved to sing. At first I’d sing just classic children's songs an poetry. Singinghelped me forget about the world around me, and allowed me to just focus on myself, an my voice. It was rejuvenating. Eventually my two passions combined and I was singing about the heroes whom I adored.One night my sister arrived home really late. She climbs in through our bedroom window, covered in dirt and scratches. In her hands was an object about arms length covered by a brown cloth.“I got you a mandolin!” she exclaimed.“Since you love singing, and because you don’t need no man.”I laughed, and she smiled that infectious smile. As she unveiled the instrument I was astonished. The woodwork looked amazingly well done. The gold trimming around it depicted a unique and beautiful floral design that seemed to breathe under the full moonlight. On one side of the front it said my name, on the other it said hers. In my hands the mandolin felt perfect, like it belonged in my grasp.“I love it, thank you!” I hugged her tightly.As I tried out the mandolin I looked at my sister and asked her.“Don’t you want to sing with me?”“No, no, singing is just your thing!” She smiled.“Yeah... maybe it’s just mine.” I’d say. —————————————One day my parents told me that they have finally decided on a suitor for me to marry. Someweird noble in a far far away land, whose main exports is donkey. The Hrek family. I couldn’t stand it, I didn’t want this. I wanted to make my own story, just like the heroes from so long ago that I’ve read about. So I left it all behind. Late at night as I was leaving the castle my sister grabbed my hand.“Don’t leave!” she pleaded.“I have to! There’s no way I’m going to marry that Hrek Noble!”“But where would you go!? What would you do!?”“Does it even matter? Maybe I’ll sing, maybe I’ll write, maybe I’ll die. Anything is better than this!”I turned to face her.“There has to be more than my story than this! Don’t you ever think about life beyond these walls!? beyond marriage?!”“I... No I guess I haven’t really thought about it that much.” She admitted, letting go of my hand. She then looked at my, teary eyed, and smiled.“Maybe it’s just you.” She said, her voice almost breaking.“Yeah maybe it’s just me.” I said confidently.——————————————————In the past two years I travelled most of the world. I’ve seen people who used ice as weapons, a half-man half donkey hellbent on finding a gunman, a gunman hellbent on killing donkeys,a grand library controlled by magic, and so much more. Getting by through my knowledge and voice. All this time I’ve been searching for my story, for my purpose. And now I’m here, on a boat with a man named Oboe, sailing towards some weir citynamed Bolobin.“Hey miss, we’ve been sailing fer a couple o’days now” “Indeed.”“You never told meh yer name y’know.”“It’s May.” I said “May Bell”“Weird name...” Oboe said.I looked down on my mandolin. Despite the use it never seem to wear down. The gold trimmings still shimmered underneath the sun. I ran my fingers on it’s front, feeling forthe names. On one side said my sisters name: Loryal. As I reached for the other side, feeling for my old name I whispered the saying my sister would say long ago.“Maybe it’s Maybeline.”"9/18/2017 22:07:26,Roderick,Human,Fighter,"Roderick dreamed of joining the military and had passed all the training to join the empire's elite forces and go on deployment, all at the age of 17, when he found out he was going to be a father.

Well, regardless, I am going to be conducting an experiment involving the use of steam technology and machinery in order to create a mechanical human. I wanted to use this journal to record my progress, hoping to make my experiment sound grandiose and epic. Upon placing my pen to the paper I realized that the idea is idiotic. And yet as I am writing now I’m starting to find this journal to be very useful. I decided I am going to continue writing in this journal!	I once had the idea whilst reading of a grand library from the far south east. The library itself runs on some sort of magic, and is even taken care of by this huge mystical creature- whose voice supposedly can reach every corner of the facility itself. Inside the library, an array of rare and one-of-a-kind books, recipes, and the like. And at the front door stand two stone statues that not only act as guardians, but as the key for getting inside the library! I was amazed! How can solid stone move as if it were human!	Unfortunately those things run on magic, and having stone humans controlled by magic is a feat near impossible in Blanket (placeholder name)… The constant invasions make Miasma unpredictable… unstable. Not to mention I have no magical capabilities whatsoever! As a kid I tried submersing myself in the magical arts but to no avail. Most people say the miasma just doesn’t like me.	One thing I was good at was building, creating, and imagining devices. I’m writing too much… Well anyways some 18 years later and I helped design and build one of the first steam train engines! It was then I had the idea. We don’t need silly unreliable magic, we can just use machinery! Instead of simplistic stone magic I can create mechanical human! Using steam and pistons to help move its body, it can perform just like a human, or like it’s run on magic! I have a schematic for how it and all the necessary materials to build it. This is going to be great! M. Day Shamwam_________________________________“He’s running late…” I say under my breath.Standing outside of the diner under the awning. People scurry along the cobbled sidewalk, covering their heads from the rain. A loud sharp whistle can be heard through the pitter-patter from across the street. As I watch the people leave the station, dispersing into the nearby shops and cafes, my eyes glaze. He always does this. Always arrives a little bit late just so he could show up behind me and say“Am I really?”I turn around and there he was. Holding a folded newspaper over his head he was failing to protect his usually crazy frizzed hair, which was now plastered against his forehead and glasses. His glasses were constantly sliding down due to rain and his small button nose being able to hold it up. Underneath it all was his same crooked smile, as if he was trying to say “I got you didn’t I?”  And under the shadow of the night sky his bright blue eyes shined. He looked beautiful.I poke his nose hard enough to push him back.“You’re late and you know it.”“Yeah yeah, I know. But wait till you hear about my day.”				_______________________________“Really? Mechanical humans?” I say open mouthed.“It sounds impossible.”“Well he’s basing his theory on stone human-like golems he found in some library. But those things are controlled by strong magic, and with the fluctuating miasma it’s practically impossible.”“So it’s just not possible here.” My voice trails off as the waiter brings us our deserts. I looked around the restaurant. Everyone at each table seemed to be talking their heart out. Some were drunkenly singing, others were laughing tears, and one couple in the corner who seemed to be in a screaming contest. ‘This place is nice” I think to myself. The restaurant is able to control the miasma through some machinery that gives each table its own ‘sound bubble’. No one can hear you talk, and you can’t hear anyone outside the bubble. Maybe if someone could use this technology…“Controlling a sound bubble and controlling a machine to be and act like a human are too different things.” He said, reading the expression on my face.“It is technically possible, but it would take a skilful person with practically full control of the miasma.”The only ones with that much control would probably be a priest or any of those religious folk. But often times they don’t use their ‘miracles’ for personal favours or experiments. And leaving isn’t much of an option as well. With almost routine invasions a normal person would die the minute they set foot outside of Blanket. If you knew some of the secret entrances though, getting in and out is only slightly less deadly. That’s the one up side for these invasions, I thought. Clients are willing to pay more to get anything or anyone out or into the city. In fact earlier today one of my clients wanted to-“So, how was your day?” he asked. He always seems to know.I smiled.“You would not believe the weird stuff my client’s into.”				_____________________________________January 17th, 19X+1	Power! This is the hardest thing about the machine. The amount of power it takes to make it completely functional is insane!	After completely model A-1, nicknamed “Alfonso”, I hooked him up to a generator. However his movement was 30% below optimal speed and his range of motion was severely limited to the 10 ft. wire that was giving him life… I ended up having to scrap him.	The next model was B-1 named “Baxter”. I tried using a modified version of some of the machines that absorb and manipulate the miasma to help power him, but unfortunately Baxter couldn’t handle the power and ended up dying. Poor Baxter.	From Cameron to Justin they all failed to meet my requirements or managed to somehow kill themselves. And yet I cannot give up. There must be something that can make them more efficient, more powerful, something more… human.	As I am writing I managed to reach an idea. How did I not see this before? It takes a human to be human. If I am able to somehow implant a human into my creation, then it could move and act just as if it were made of flesh and bones! But better.I am going to have to make huge adjustments to the design.M.Day Shamwam.				________________________________March 23rd, 19X+1“He’s kidnapping people?”“Supposedly, at least that’s what the officers told me.” I say as I drink my coffee outside the café.“I knew something was up when he stopped showing up to work, but to think he’d take this experiment too far…” my voice trails off. I want to say I should’ve known but I really shouldn’t have. I mean who would’ve thought someone like M.Day would kidnap people?“…Yeah.” She said, looking away with her dark emerald eyes. Under the setting sun her dark blonde hair seemed to be on fire. Past her I notice that the usually busy street has died down. There have been reports of missing persons around dusk. Seems to have rattled the district. Off in the distance I can hear the whistle of my train as it leaves the station.I look back and notice that she’s deep in thought again. Along with a furrowed brow her eyes darting back and forth between her cup and her plate as if waiting for one of them to move. She must’ve hear something while working for a client.“What did you hear?” I ask.“The church hired me to look for one of their high priests… After a little digging around I heard something from some of the homeless people. There’s apparently someone going around looking for ‘magically gifted’ people.”“And you think that person might be M. Day.” I affirm.“Yeah…”“Well regardless I think I’m going to go talk to him.” I have to find out what he’s up to. And if it’s something bad, then I have to stop him.“I don’t like the sound of this…” She looks at me, worried. I know recently she’s been planning a way for us to leave Blanket. With the invasions and the missing people I’m sure anyone would want to leave. But I know she doesn’t want to leave without me first.“So you’re coming with me?“Need to make sure nothing happens to you” she says playfully, while poking my nose. She’s trying to hide her worry. Maybe we shouldn’t do this… But I have to go. I think I’m going to always be thinking about this if we left.We’re going.As the moon rises we set off towards M.Day’s house. Off in the distance towards the east,  towers of black smoke loom over Blanket.					______________________March 24th, 19X+1	I FINALLY SUCCEEDED! Through (detailed explanation) I managed to link the mind and soul of a human to the machine. However there were some complications… Last night as I was going to perform my experiment on the high priest Xavier and DJ-1. However two people barged in during the middle of the experiment. Callum, my old work mate, and his girlfriend Edea They came to try and stop me, told me that I was taking this experiment too far. They were wrong. I just didn’t take it far enough.	As the experiment started, invaders came to raid Blanket. This caused a sudden gigantic surge of miasma throughout the city. This caused my transplantation device to go haywire. When I came to Xavier was gone, all that was left was a pile of purple ashes. Callum and Edea’s bodies were on the floor, lifeless. Unlike me they took the full blast from the miasma wave. This must’ve caused them to merge with DJ-1 instead of Xavier. 	When I powered the robot I cried for joy. It was moving as if it were human! Such dexterity! Such speed! I couldn’t believe the sight that I was seeing!	And yet there was still something wrong. Due to two people becoming one with the machine it seems to have developed two different personalities. Sometimes it calls out for Callum, touching its own nose. Other times its calling for Edea, trying to find the bodies that they once belong to. After 12 hours of monitoring the robot it seems that I have to remove this… kink in the system for the machine to reach maximum potential. They said I took it to far. But there is no way I’m stopping now.As I write I am preserving their bodies.M.

We feel ourselves pull back an arm and as it lunges forward we squish the bodies. This sends a wave of electricity through us.Then we punch again, and we’re shocked. Every time we try to destroy what’s in front of us we feel ourselves going numb. Every shock seems to melt us, destroy us… change us. The memories we once had burned away.Eventually it all stops.

To get away from them for a bit, she quit her job at at the church, trained as a paladin, and then to make some cash, worked on a boat at a major shipping port. "9/18/2017 22:48:41,Dima,Human,Ranger,"Dima turned back toward his village. He could barely see it now. Really, if he was being honest, he probably couldn't see it at all. Just a red glow illuminating the horizon where it would have been. That morning it had been his village, as the day went on it became a growing column of smoke rising behind him, and as night set in the smoke faded into the darkening sky and was replaced with The red glow. Dima closed his eyes to get his bearings. The raiding party arrived a couple hours after sunrise. Disguised as drift raiders coming from the dunes their armor betrayed them as a professional army. No desert raiders would fight in anything that bulky. These were coasters who had probably never set foot in the desert before.Not that it mattered. Arath was a small village, maybe a couple dozen people of fighting age, and none of them real fighters. It was over before it really began. They grabbed whatever fighting implements they could find - Dima had always been good with his hunting knives - but were quickly routed by the professional soldiers.Dima's father fell in the fighting. Sharaia, his sister, had just, disappeared. One minute she was standing with Dima, loosing arrows into the attackers, he next she was just, gone. Dima had fled moments later with a small bag of supplies. The sun was below the horizon now, so that must have been 10, maybe 12 hours ago. He had run a short distance, maybe a couple kilometers, before slowing to a walk. Running in the desert was a good way to end up dead. He had walked the rest of the day. The drift wasn't easy terrain, but it was his home, so he figured another 20 kilometers was reasonable (that would explain the fires being over the horizon). At least enough distance that nobody was likely to find him. He considered his next move. North, further into the drift. Harsh travel, but a coaster army would never venture that far into he desert, and he could hook up with a drifter community. South, back toward Arath. The raiders had likely rejoined the main army, so it was safe, but to what end? Find his sister? Even a master fracker wouldn't find her if she didn't want to be found, and Dima was far from a master. Plus, as much as he liked to think he would protect her, she was far more capable on her own than he was. East, to the grand capital. He could warn them, but surely their scouts already knew, and what use would one he be there. West, to the Spire mountains. He could follow the river, and the travel would be easy, but that's the most likely supply line for the invaders, and he wasn't eager to cross them again. Dima opened his eyes. "9/18/2017 22:49:44,Xat,Tabaxi,Rogue,"Xat showed up one day at a town that an adventuring party was passing through, and just kept traveling with them ever since. One thing they keep secret is their place in Tabaxi society. Xat is not the name their parents gave them. Xat was supposed to be raised as an heir to an influential noble family, but one day they ran away from home and didn't come back. They found more meaning in a week of camping out and helping common folk than they got out of all the schooling and pampering their parents gave them. Xat sometimes misses the comforts of home, but they feel satisfied knowing that they're free. Plus, being able to randomly act like a cat for the entertainment of others is something they've always wanted to do."9/18/2017 22:50:29,Broadly,Kobold,Wizard,"Broadly was raised in the underground tunnels of Castings, a town inhabited by denizens cast out of civilized society. As a small child, she enjoyed spending time in her makeshift library, and read widely on topics like history, arcana, and religion. When she was nine years old, her grandma stabbed her with a knitting needle (not an unusual form of discipline in kobold society), rupturing one of her lungs. As a result, she is often out of breath (and has a negative constitution modifier). Despite this, Broadly has mastered the arts of acrobatics and evocation magic, making her a Flip-Wizard not to be reckoned with."9/18/2017 22:50:50,Arabella Candor,Halfling (lightfoot),"""Tarocchi"" (homebrew class; plays based on standard 52-card deck)","Arabella grew up in a small religious ""hobbit-town""; the citizens worshipped the goddess of fate, and so she grew up with those teachings of the inevitability of fate and destiny practically drilled into her head. One day, a mysterious person gave her a gift: a set of tarot cards that, Arabella was told, could read the patterns of fate and tell their owner what they needed to do in order to keep fate on its path. Then the person left, never to be seen by Ara or anyone else again. The odd thing is, Ara can't remember who the person was; whether it was a former priest of her village, a newcomer, or even some kind of ethereal being, most of Ara's knowledge and memory of the encounter appears to have been magically tampered with. As such, Ara set out on a journey to find this person and learn why they entrusted HER of all halflings with such a powerful gift (and possibly even to return it)."9/18/2017 22:50:56,Kaz,Half-Orc,Cleric,"Kaz grew up in a suburb of the country's capital, Bridgeport. Her orc mother and her human father didn't interact much, and when they did, they were usually fighting. Kaz was raised as male, and when she expressed that she felt more like a girl, both her parents reacted by ignoring her. It wasn't much different than the usual treatment, so she took advantage of the situation and used the neglect to live as she desired. Things were normal, or at least her idea of normal, for years. Her father, however, began making purchases he really couldn't. He got indebted to some of the wrong people and panicked. Since he didn't care much about his home life anyway, he set the place ablaze to fake his own death. Kaz was inside at the time the fire was set, spending time with her best friend, Sanric. In the ensuing panic and falling debris as they attempted to escape, Kaz was just slightly faster than Sanric. A wooden beam fell on her, and she used her strength to dodge it and fling it backwards. As a result, the beam landed on Sanric, trapping him. She instantly realized her mistake and desperately tried to lift it, but smoke was quickly filling her lungs and more debris kept falling on top of her and her friend. Eventually, she was forced to leave Sanric behind after another beam landed on top of the other beam and trapped him even further. Kaz fled to a smaller city in the country, Talonrest. She lived here with the grief of her lost friend and former life for some time. In that time, she found a temple dedicated to a righteous, broken God, Ilmater. She spent days in the temple studying his teachings and his miracles, eventually opting to become his devoted cleric. Later, Talonsrest was destroyed in another fire, set by a cult group dedicated to a rival God of Ilmater. Kaz took this as a sign and returned to Bridgeport, hellbent on making the world a better place through any means."9/18/2017 22:50:59,Riven Coin,Gnome,Rogue,"Grew up as a pickpocket for a local thieve's guild in his hometown. Eventually taught himself to read by standing around outside the local schoolhouse, and started to steal books. He quickly became an avid reader, and by chance, one day stole a book detailing simple illusion and charm magic. From there he easily paid for his way out of the guild, then became a fulltime book thief... until, that is, the mage he stole from found out about him. He had to leave town pretty quickly, and wound up stowing away in the wagon of another adventurer setting out. "9/18/2017 22:53:11,Dani,Warforged,Wizard,"Dani was created to be an assistant and test subject for a sorcerer who wanted to become immortal through his magic. While his studies did extend the sorcerer's life, it did not prevent him from dying by falling down the stairs, and Dani was left alone to continue browsing through the sorcerer's books and scrolls alone. Eventually they realized that they were not bound to the tower, and could go out into the world to gain even more knowledge, and so Dani left to travel in disguise and find out as much as they could."9/18/2017 22:57:39,Feldspar Brannfjell,Dwarf,Barbarian,"Feldspar is the second daughter of the Lady of Brannfjell, a dormant volcanic island in the far reaches of the arctic. Brannfjell is a remote island with rich deposits of gems and metals, but no arable land. The dwarfs of the island are renowned for their craftmanship of both weapons and jewelry, and trade with a select few merchants. They are very protective of their island, telling the secret of its location to a few trusted merchants who are sworn to secrecy on pain of death, and training all women (and even some of the men) to fight in case of an invasion. Upon completing a record size order for Brannfjell's finest weapons from a southern nation, Brannfjell's smiths sent Feldspar and her sister abroad to escort the shipment. Before they had been at sea a week, they were set upon by pirates who killed Feldspar's sister and stole the weapons, a collection called the Levianthan's Teeth. While grieving her sister, Feldspar must piece together what happened. The pirates were clearly looking for the shipment, not part of a random raid. Who betrayed Feldspar's clan by telling the pirates where the ship would be? What are the thieves plans with enough weapons to turn the tide of a war? Feldspar must figure this out for herself, separated from her clan by their secretive ways, she is a stranger in the world, unable to even book passage back to her home."9/18/2017 22:58:32,Ambeeo,Kobold,Swamp Druid,"Following a devastating tunnel collapse, Ambeeo's tribe was forced to move into the sewers of a nearby city. With poor disease resistance, most of the tribe fell prey to infection and the large vermin within. However, Ambeeo displayed a peculiarly strong immune system and an affinity with rats that allowed him to survive the conditions that killed the rest of his brood. Time in the darkness deteriorated the luster of his scales, making them a mottled, sickly hue and damaged his already tenuous grip on reality still further, leading the young kobold to grow up... odd. He is highly abrasive and somewhat repulsive in his appearance and behavior, but is possessed of a fiendish intellect and can engage in lively discussions with his preferred variety of mammalian life: Rats. He eschews the typical kobold trapbuilding in favour of sewer magicks and potent unguents of his own design. He approaches each new adventure as an expedition of great importance to his alchemical research, and when outside the comfort of his makeshift laboratory he is often found in the presence of Foamface, an albino rat with which he feels a special kinship."9/18/2017 22:59:45,No.153,Warforged,Bard,"No.153 is a robotic entity, one of many whose sole purpose is to travel the land and gather data; in 153's case, specifically musical data. When asked about why they do this, 153 explains that their master, R. Kiever, desires to collect and consume all knowledge in the world, and created an army of robots specifically to help him carry out that task. However, 153's descriptions of Kiever are vague at best, and the more they are pressed on their master's identity and intentions, the cloudier things tend to become. It seems even No.153 does not know who they or R. Kiever really are..."9/18/2017 23:01:24,Konk,Dwarf,Fighter,Hes a doofus9/18/2017 23:03:45,Mirabella Trill,Halfling,Ninja,"Mira Trill is a young female Halfling that loves life and doesn't take anything for granted. As a child she had everything she ever wanted, her parents were both real high society Halflings. Mirabella Trill was born to Michelangelo and Rachael Trill. The two Halflings made their life by killing in their assassin's guild named Night's embrace. When the two had Mira they left the guild and the guild never had any problems however they were sad to see their best two assassins leave. A man in the guild that went by the name Darkblade, which fit him because his blade was pure black, got the couple a job in town working as assistants for big businesses and soon they were promoted and Michelangelo soon owned his own business. Being very wealthy they soon were able to pay for anything and everything young Mira wanted. She got it all and was soon a spoiled yet humble child. The city she lived in was very big and like any other big city had its share of poor citizens. She grew up fine but lonely she had her friends that she loved to hang out with go to parties and explore life with but for many years she never had a boyfriend or even a male friend at the least. When she turned 20 her friends threw her a very big party for her Birthday. Everyone of importance was to be there everyone their age and more. She had a wonderful time and the party lasted well into the night. Towards the middle of the night she met a halfling that had just turned 20 a week ago himself. His name was Niccolo and he made her feel better than any other girl in the world. You see the reason why she had no other boys in her life wasn't because she was ugly or anything it was no other boy paid her any mind. They all chased after the girls who gave themselves to them willingly. However Niccolo was different he was mature and handsome also. He was also the first boy her age ever to notice her and call her beautiful. From that point on they both knew they were in love. After that night it was all she needed to know who she wanted to spend her life with. He told her he would come see her the next day for dinner. The next morning she couldn't wait and went to see her new love as soon as she could. She had her connections look him up and find where he lived and she went instantly. When she got there she was surprised. He lived in a middle class district and worked for a blacksmith as his apprentice. She went to him and he got angry with her then he calmed down and apologized. He never told her about where he lived or what he did because he knew who she was, everyone did. They all knew she was the daughter of a business owner that owned a lot of places in the city. He didn't want her to be turned away from him because of who he was. She just told him “If I wasn't in love with you do you think I would of went this early to see you?” He just smiled then kissed her. She had her first kiss then. Halfway through she moved in with him. Her parents paid for the place it was in a market district not to far from Niccolo's work and it wasn't as poor as his old home. They were upper middle class and a year later they were engaged. The marriage was planned for a year after the engagement. Her parents getting on in years had decided one of the last things they wanted to do for their daughter was throw her a big wedding. It was planned to be at their mansion and many people were invited. However 2 months prior her father died. They had the funeral and all of her father's friends and family were invited. Darkblade was there and was now the leader of the guild. He talked to Mira and asked her to join eager for the daughter of the two best assassins to join. She declined. Her mother now in charge of the business needed help and Mira decided she wanted to take over the business when she was old enough. Niccolo had no idea what her parents did until that day and after was kind of scared of Mira and her family. Mira reassured him that she wanted no part of that life and her parents gave it up before she was born. He was still a little unnerved by it but let it go by. Then a week before the wedding Darkblade arrived on Mira's doorstep. Mira was furious telling him to leave that she had no intention to join the guild and push him out the door. On his way out he told her that he had no intention of asking her to join just that there was an assassin after her family from a rival guild. He told them they needed to leave at once to avoid conflict. Thinking this was a way to get her to join the guild she told him never to come back and to leave her family alone. The next day at the wedding rehearsal everything went perfect. At the dinner they had a toast and as they all took a sip everyone but Mira started to fall out of their chairs. Suddenly three men came into sight. Two of them grabbed Mira and the other started slitting the throats of her friends and family in front of her. As they worked up the table they reached her mother and Mira cried out for them to stop. The man simply stated she had a choice, her mother or her fiancé. She sat there terrified then with a quick puff of smoke the men were killed and her mother spared. Darkblade had rushed in to save her and her mother. He explained she needed to leave and head back to the Guild Hall for safety. Her mother revealed Darkblade had been her brother and never kept his eyes off the family. Niccolo was upset not knowing what happened while he was drugged. His family had been killed and now he was to be relocated to an Assassin Guild. His only saving grace was Mira was untouched. They both decided to train with the guild and learn how to better defend themselves in return they would serve the guild. Niccolo often stays behind forging weapons for the Guild while Mira prefers to scout for intelligence. They both frequently write letters back and forth when they're apart."9/18/2017 23:07:57,Finnan Thornwatch,Tiefling,Druid,"Finnan Thornmwatch is the last surviving member of the Thornwatch clan, sworn to protect the Ruins of Graythorn. He never had any siblings and when he was 8 years old both his parents died when an invading nation attacked their town. After the shock of losing his parents he fled to the woods to live among the ruins his family had been protecting for many years. He knew there was purpose to their protection, even if he didn't know what that purpose was, and being among the ruins he swore he could still feel the presence of his family. He felt comfortable and safe there and he knew his family would want him to be there.Abandoning the civilized world at such a young age to guard these ruins, Finnan grew very close to nature and would often meditate and commune with the spirits of the surrounding woods. One day while in this meditation, Finnan noticed an elvish figure tracking and hunting a large brown bear. Recognizing the bear as the recent mother of 3 cubs Finnan ran and leapt in front of the hunter's arrow to protect the bear shouting ""You mustn't kill her! She has cubs!"", being shot in place of the creature. Startled, the hunter rushed to Finnan's aid but it was too late and the arrow had struck right through his heart.Sylvanus, God of Wild Nature, came to Finnan in death and told him that he had given his life for a noble cause but being the last living protector of Graythorn he could not die just yet. Sylvanus then told Finnan that he would revive him for a cost that he would one day need to pay, but not to worry for as long as he stood protector of Graythorn he would not need to pay this debt. Finnan accepted and was revived, still laying in the hunter's arms. Finnan spent the next few days healing and getting to know the hunter, spilling his life story with the first person he had seen in the 12 years since his family had died. The hunter was actually a huntress. A short athletic Drow named Zar'rae who too lived just outside these woods nearly 80 years, raised by her adopted Wood Elf family.During the few days spent healing Finnan's physical features began to slowly shift from human to almost demonic. His light hair grew even lighter until it was pure white. His pale skin grew darker and more red in color. His brow slowly lost all hair and merged to form a set of 4 small toothlike horns. His teeth sharpened almost vampirically, the front teeth growing in length as well. And a thin tail with a pointed spade shaped tip poked it's way through his pants. Seeing this transformation from a paleskinned Human to a redskinned Tiefling, Zar'rae knew all too well from her being a Drow, how ever good Finnan may be, if he ever were to rejoin society now he would surely be discriminated against. Zar'rae began to take pity on him and offered her friendship to Finnan, visiting him daily at the ruins.Naturally, as time passed Zar'rae had finally grown old enough in her family's eyes to set off and travel the rest of the world, and so she did, and Finnan became alone once again. After a few weeks, Finnan decided to set off on a journey of his own and catch up with his only friend... wrecklessly abandoning his sworn duty to Graythorn... and his debt to Sylvanus..."9/18/2017 23:28:00,Grimbobo,Goblin,Bard,"He was a young goblin cast from his cave dwelling, for his passion for music was considered strange to the other goblins.

His family was of some considerable wealth, at least enough to afford the tutelage of the displaced Rasheman witch Ivani. When he was six years old, his parents left him in Ivani’s care as they departed for a trademeet. They never returned. To this day, Mav doesn’t know what happened to them. Luckily, they left Ivani a fine inheritance so she could take him in as an apprentice.Mav’ren was a capable, if difficult, apprentice. While he understood the theory behind magic, he had difficulty grasping at the threads of power. Because of this, Ivani crafted for him a special focus: A ring and bracelet fashioned of copper wire. Within each is a tiny needle, enough to prick the skin and draw blood, closing a circuit of energy that allows Mav to manipulate the forces needed for any spell.Ivani was a good mentor, taking care of Mav’ren for three years. One day, she left with what Mav could only describe as a band of men. She left with some urgency, gathering her spellbook and whatever she could cram into a backpack.None of them ever came back. To this day, Mav doesn’t know what happened to them, or why they left. If Ivani had a journal, she took it with her.or seven months, Mav’ren took care of himself. He knew all the passwords to the wards, where all the gold was kept, where all the good books and reagents were stored. It sucked not having Ivani around, but Mav could take care of the place (as was part of his apprenticeship).That changed when Cranmer broke into the place.It was clear that Cranmer had no business being there, but being a thief, a wizard’s manse that had been empty for over half a year was up for exploration – at least, before the other gangs barged in. But seeing Mav on his own… well… Cranmer wasn’t about to leave the boy on his own, so he made an offer. Mav’ren took about five minutes to come to a decision.Cranmer’s Guild, the Crows, had the most unique weapon amongst the gangs of Thieves in Saerloon: diplomacy. They established the boundaries of the various Guilds, cobbled alliances, and helped keep the peace in the city – and all profited from it. Cranmer led his crew through respect, both given and received. It was here the Mav’ren’s talents came to light.As he lived amongst his guildmates, Mav continued his studies. In the process, he also understood how criminal activity worked. Five years after he joined the Crows, Mav became aware of the activity of a freelancer disrupting the peace. Cranmer put Mav to use, letting him establish the pattern of activity, the mode of operations, and other patterns that brought the rogue to the Guilds’ own justice.Mav continued this line of work for years, helping the keep freelancers in line and the Guilds accountable. The Crows were small but efficient and profitable. One Crow, Thalia, took an interest in Mav, helping him “become a man.” It was a mutual arrangement given she became a woman. Despite the nature of thieves, the two became a loving pair.Six months ago, Mav needed to travel to Selgaunt for a particular tome he needed. When he returned, his guild house was empty. No sign of forced entry, no sign of battle, no sign of treasure. Despite this, Mav found several trinkets left behind that he knew no Crow would abandon. In his lover’s room he found the silver locket he gave her, his lock of hair still inside.Given all the signs, Mav knew he had one course of action: get the hell out of the city. He burned the hair in the locket and departed Saerloon, looking for numbers to keep him safe.To this day, he doesn’t know what happened to the Crows, but whatever pattern’s been established, he intends to decipher it… and break it."9/18/2017 23:33:08,Qiren,Elf,Rogue,Banished for stealing to pay off his gambling debts.9/18/2017 23:34:52,Butch Cassidy,Halfling,Rouge,.9/18/2017 23:45:54,Arren Ansel,Human (Variant),Fighter,"Son of ex-adventurer's, looking to see what adventuring life is like."9/18/2017 23:46:32,Avicia Bexley,Lizardfolk,Wizard,"After her village was massacred by soldiers, she was raised by a human scholar as a nature-versus-nurture social experiment.

Clueless to the sarcasm and cunning, Salarian agreed the clan had grown too small for his heroism, and set out in search of others to bathe in his glory. With his legend preceding him (if only by the distance of his own voice), Salarian walks the land, bestowing his greatness on a troubled world one victim at a time. "9/19/2017 1:03:09,O'Akeecha,Aarakocra,Wizard,"O'Akeecha is trying to find his way home.The Aarakocra fledgling was fascinated by magic and spent hours observing the shaman at work, watching her preparations, memorising her rituals, recording all he learned in his journal. Impulsive and curious, he took an opportunity when her back was turned to try what he had observed, using some of her collection of magical components and artifacts.The results were unfortunate.A bright flash surrounded him, and the scroll he was reading crumbled to dust in his grip. O'Akeecha, startled, found himself looking at an alien landscape. He overflew the land, seeking help, but every humanoid he approached drove him off, startled by his appearance and manner of speech.O'Akeecha has come to realise that he is in a different world altogether. To have any hope of returning home, he must become a skilled practitioner of magic, able to bend reality and reach out to other planes. He has no home, no funds, no allies, and no teacher - only the notes in his journal of magic.Lost and alone, he has no idea how to start."9/19/2017 1:05:04,Selwin,Aasimar,Monk,"Some people think Selwin insane. Selwin is one of them. From an early age, his sleep was torn by nightmares of death and destruction. Whole towns burned, the population slaughtered. And always, there was the image of Selwin standing over the corpse of his father, a bloody dagger in hand. His father had no patience for the crazy child. The big man's violent nature resulted in many beatings, and eventually in the drunken murder of Selwin's mother. His father left without a backward glance. After a period of wandering and begging to survive, Selwin found himself within a monastery. The abbot declared him touched by heaven, and took him in. Years of meditation, martial training and discipline brought Selwin a level of control, but his nightmares never left him. In his 10th year at the monastery, Selwin's vision finally became reality. A military force attacked and destroyed the town and sacked the monastery, slaughtering any who resisted. The leader of the invaders was Selwin's father, who didn't even recognise his son. Would the destruction have been avoided if Selwin had obeyed his vision and killed his father? Unable to answer, the tortured monk drifts the world, fleeing his nightmares. "9/19/2017 1:06:50,Tempest,Genasi,Sorcerer,"Tempest blames his misfortune on his parents. To be fair, so do they. They sought a blessing for their unborn child, that he might fully achieve his potential. Neither knew the secret shame of their bloodlines; a djinni ancestor in his, and a draconic ancestor in hers. Thanks to their well-intentioned efforts, their son is forced to suffer the marks of his double heritage. Patches of bright copper scales cover his arms, legs and back, and his skin and hair gleams a light blue tint.Tempest is not amused by this cosmic joke. As short-tempered as his name suggests, he takes umbrage at any slight. There were many such insults during his youth, and it was during one of the resulting tantrums that the boy first exhibited signs of magic. Tempest has embraced this power as a means of revenging himself on those who insult him, and he is liberal in his interpretation of what constitutes an insult. As a result, Tempest has few friends and is rarely able to stay in one place for very long. Not that he cares; he prefers to rely on nobody but himself. He may work with others for as long as their purpose aligns but as soon as the job is done, Tempest is in the wind. "9/19/2017 1:08:09,Bigman,Firbolg,Cleric,"Bigman has failed.Bigman protected the Forest with his tribe. One day, the Forest told him a man had come. Bigman went to watch and see. Father Thomas said, ""Hello, big man."" Father Thomas was a friend to the Forest, so the tribe decided he could stay. Bigman spent much time with Father Thomas, who taught him about the Goddess. The Goddess loved the Forest, so Bigman decided the Goddess was good. Bigman liked the Goddess. Then the Forest told Bigman that monsters had come. Bigman ran to his tribe, but monsters had killed them all. Bigman ran back to Father Thomas, but monsters had been there also. Bigman did not know what to do without his tribe or his friend. The Goddess told Bigman to take money from Father Thomas and leave the Forest. There were too many monsters and Bigman could not fight them all. The Goddess told Bigman to find new friends and train hard and one day come back to the Forest and face the monsters. Bigman is sad for his tribe and his friend and the Forest. But Bigman trusts the Goddess. "9/19/2017 1:09:48,Berenthos Frostmantle,Gnome,Ranger,"Berenthos Frostmantle had every reason to be happy. He was married to a woman he loved above all other things in the world. He adored their daughter and their home and their lives. He loved his trade, and he was good at it. Under his hands, timber was carved, shaped and made to live again in a new form. His pieces were sought after, and the Frostmantle mark was a status symbol in homes of the wealthy. He reveled in the love of his daughter, who smiled over the texts she studied so hard, overjoyed every time he brought her some new trinket carved just for her, laughing like the child she used to be. Berenthos was lost when he found the body of his wife, and the single set of bloodied footprints leaving his home for the woods. His mind went away for a time, and he wandered the forest looking for his missing daughter. She must have been taken by someone, he reasoned. Someone who left no prints on the bloodied floor. Someone who left no sign of their presence. There was no other explanation. Eventually, the forest was more his home than the building that had once held his life. Berenthos lived wild, always searching. He had no use for love any more, or compassion. He grew into a hard man his family would not have recognised. And he went out into the world, seeking what had been taken from him, and vowing to take it back. "9/19/2017 1:11:14,Crag Stonethrow,Goliath,Paladin,"Life isn't fair. Crag Stonethrow is determined to fix that. The Hiwi-Toka tribe taught Crag that a thing no longer useful is abandoned. A childhood friend was crushed by a falling rock; leg useless, he was shunned until he fell behind the tribe and died. Crag felt it wasn't right for one to be punished for misfortune not of his own making. He began intervening in similar situations. He carried an elder when she fell behind the tribe. He defended a husband from a drunk wife. He took the misfortune of others upon himself and made it his mission to solve their problems. Crag's life changed the day he stumbled onto a human caravan raided by bandits. He tracked the bandits, challenged them, and left their unconscious bodies behind him as he carried the stolen goods to the rightful owners. The grateful caravanserie fed him and told him tales of a world in which such injustices were common. The goliath, shocked at what he heard, left his tribe without a word or second glance and set out to even the playing field.  Crag now makes his way through the world, fixing it one wrong at a time. He doesn't know where his power comes from and, frankly, he doesn't care. As far as he is concerned, the world is broken. And he's not going to stand for it. "9/19/2017 1:12:41,Elegy Smith,Half-elf,Bard,"All his life, Elegy Smith escaped into stories. Children, including his brothers and sisters, tormented him for his pointed ears. His father resented him for being a constant reminder of his mother's unfaithfulness, and his mother's eyes filled with regret for a lost love every time she looked at him. Mother never spoke of his true sire, so Elegy sought refuge in tales of elf princes and lost inheritances. Eventually he began to create his own stories, which he hoarded like precious gems. He never realised that his talent for spinning tales could be of practical use, until a week of foul weather stranded a minstrel in the village. Elegy listened to the troubadour singing tales of legendary heroes, enraptured. By the end of the week, he was determined to make the singing and telling of stories his profession. Leaving behind few who missed him, Elegy made his way to the city and won a position in the college of bardic lore. He excelled at his studies, but tutors felt he spent too much time in research and recommended a few years of practical experience on the road to make him a truly exceptional performer. Elegy packed his things and set out, his mind set on creating the greatest ballad of the age. Stories are everywhere, he reasoned. He just needed to find the right one. "9/19/2017 1:13:50,Ammon Greenfield,Halfling,Monk,"Ammon Greenfield was a rebellious youth. In a community known for dependability and conformity, this halfling displayed a stubborn insistence on satisfying his whims and desires instead of contributing to the fabric of society in any meaningful way. Then he fell in love. When she spurned him in favour of another despite his determined campaign of wooing, he fell into a rage and exchanged blows with his rival. He was soundly beaten and woke from unconsciousness in the medical care of a nearby monastery, a newfound anger and purpose driving him.Cue the training montage. For a year, Ammon worked under the tutelage of the monastery's masters to hone his body to the peak of martial skill. Then he returned to the village to challenge for his beloved... and found her married and nursing a newborn. Bitter and full of regret and bile, Ammon went back to the monastery, further developing his unarmed combat skills with a zeal unmatched by any other. He refused to let go of his anger, despite his sensei's attempts at instruction, and eventually left to seek a new purpose. He is still looking. "9/19/2017 1:15:04,Balto Cole,Half-orc,Fighter,"Balto Cole grew up in an orphanage, like many others in the aftermath of the war between orcs and men. He learned the value of friendship and used his size and strength to protect those younger and weaker.He took a job as a labourer for a merchant, learning combat skills from caravan guards during their layovers for cargo. He supplemented his income by fighting in the pit for the purse on offer and the wagers he made on his ability. When finally the day came that Balto was forced to kill a man, it wasn't in the ring. A noble with a large sum of money wagered against Balto sought to improve his odds by injuring Balto before a fight. The scuffle went badly, and the noble took a mortal wound. Balto knew he had no chance of a fair trial, so he left his life behind and fled.Since then, he has travelled, selling his swordarm and evading the law. He dreams of going far enough to outrun the reach of the noble family that hunts him, or to earn enough money, power and respect to defeat them and return to his home in peace.But for now, there is the road and the sword. And for now, that is enough. "9/19/2017 1:16:07,Justin Bell,Human,Rogue,"Justin Bell was a merchant for many years. He traveled extensively in his youth, seeing many places and learning a variety of skills. He had a knack for talking people out of their gold and wasn't inhibited about a little light-fingered liberation of valuables when attention was directed elsewhere. If people don't take care of their possessions, they don't really want them, do they?In his thirties, Justin set up a store where he bought from merchants to sell to customers, rather than doing the traveling himself. He became known as a procurer of specialist items for a discerning type of client. Sometimes these items were owned by other people but Justin felt that liberating them for somebody who obviously wanted them more was a public service, and one that he was uniquely qualified to perform. It was inevitable that one such liberated item would be traced to him eventually, and Justin had all his property seized and spent some months in prison. Now released, with no ties, no money, few possessions, and even fewer scruples, Justin is looking for a new direction. Surely his skills must be valuable to somebody?"9/19/2017 1:17:47,Tennyson Shott,Human,Sorcerer,"Tennyson Shott always found comfort in structure. Order brings certainty, he used to say to the university kitchen staff who worked under him. If it's good enough for the wizards, it's good enough for those of us that feed them. He was more disciplined than, say, the apprentice wizard who ruined a potion through carelessness, then then threw it into a hastily conjured rift that accidentally targeted the soup Tennyson was stirring. The cook managed one confused sip of the suddenly frothing mixture, just before it exploded. The wizards healed Tennyson, theorizing about the unique causes of the magical energy that now burst from him at irregular intervals. When he was well, they thanked him for his service. Then they fired him, explaining that he was far too dangerous to have around volatile magics. His life in ruins, Tennyson wanders the world, unable to keep a job for more than a few weeks before the magic bursts out of him and destroys something. Nerves frazzled by the chaotic existence he is forced to lead, he desperately searches for somewhere even vaguely normal where he can belong."9/19/2017 1:19:01,Arrow Flight,Kenku,Warlock,"Arrow Flight was the best scribe in his flock. He hated it. The endless routine of copying information from one piece of paper to another confined him to drudgery when he longed for excitement. When it became too much for him, he put away his quill, took up a dagger and set about emulating the rogues of his flock by robbing the townhouse of a wealthy merchant. Standing by the hangman next day, noose around his neck, Arrow Flight desperately sought escape. Hearing the creak of leather gloves on the release handle, feeling the trap door beneath him drop away, he closed his eyes and prayed to any power that could save him. And was answered. In the scintilla of time before the rope drew taut, Arrow Flight felt a dark presence enter his mind, promising survival for service. The Kenku agreed immediately, and the rope broke as he reached the end of the drop. In the confusion, using the crowd as cover, he made his escape. Now he has the excitement he craved, but his life is as tightly controlled as before. Never his own master, he wields his patron's magic in his service, collaborating with others when possible, working alone when necessary. He has the life he wanted. And he hates it. "9/19/2017 1:20:20,Cupcake Adams ,Fey Corgi ,Occultist,"She ventured through a portal in a storm water drain, from our world to the Dragon Empire. She emerged in New Corgshire, a Fey  Corgi village, and was quickly adopted by the local blacksmith as her sister. As a side effect of the interdimensional travel, Cupcake found that she could see the threads of fate and time and used this to her advantage in and out of the combat."9/19/2017 1:20:34,Zubokar,Lizardman,Rogue,"Zubokar has come a long way from the swamp.Exiled from his tribe after a clash over a female, Zubokar encountered a human hiding at the edge of their territory. With nothing better to do, Zubokar accepted coin to act as bodyguard. The lizardman followed his employer to the city, where they met with the guild of thieves. Zubokar's employer challenged the guild leader to trial by combat to resolve whatever issue had made him hide in the swamp. Zubokar stepped forward as proxy for the fight, then switched sides when the guild leader offered a greater sum of money than his current employer. After killing once for the guild leader, it was easy enough to keep doing it. Zubokar lived in the sewers beneath the city, guarding the guild's hideouts, killing when ordered, and occasionally eating a city worker who ventured into his territory. Life was good.Unfortunately, Zubokar killed a member of the nobility who was investigating ""the monster in the sewers"". With the city watch scouring the undercity, the guild leader suggested the lizardman leave the city until things calmed down. And so, with a little coin, a big appetite and a lot of time, Zubokar drifts through the world, looking for whatever comes next. "9/19/2017 1:22:02,Mica Dross,Dwarf,Wizard,"Mica Dross has always felt like a freak. His family history was a list of the most famous warriors the clan had ever produced. It was an unstated expectation that Mica also would become a mighty champion for the Kingdom Under the Mountain. That didn't happen. Mica chose instead to mine arcane libraries, seeking out rich veins of magic and absorbing what scant spellcasting knowledge was available under the mountain. He wore the armour and wielded the hammer, but it was a sham, an attempt to fit in. When he finally admitted the truth to his family, he was ostracised. His name was famous, yes - but as one of his people's very few spellcasters, an unrespected profession followed by only a handful of dwarves. When he left the mountains, seeking greater arcane knowledge, he remained a freak. An armoured spellcaster with a warhammer, from a race known to distrust magic, he was viewed as a curiosity, like a dog walking on two legs. With no place anywhere among his people or the wider world, Mica lives a gypsy lifestyle, wandering aimlessly, looking for a place to fit in. "9/19/2017 1:23:30,Mist-on-the-water,Tabaxi,Bard,"Want to hear a story? Mist-on-the-water is your man.Mist grew up in the back of a wagon. His family wandered from place to place, performing for whatever crowds they could find. Mist learned to play the tabla, drumming while his sisters danced, or accompanying his father while he spun tales of legend. His father's stories were catnip to Mist. The youngster sought out other legends and folktales wherever they traveled and began to perform them himself. After several years, Mist and his father agreed that his continued development could best be served by striking out on his own for a time. Following a celebration full of song, dance, joy and pride, Mist-on-the-water left his loving family troupe to go solo.The years since have been good ones. While his curiosity sometimes gets him into trouble, his quick wits and fast talking just as often get him out again. Often alone, sometimes traveling with a troupe for a season, Mist continues to wander the world and gather the tales he loves. "9/19/2017 1:25:06,Arashi Stormborn,Tiefling,Cleric,"Arashi Stormborn was ostracised from the day of his birth in the midst of a raging tempest. The horns that indicated his demonic heritage drove his horrified father to leave that same night. He was raised by his mother, shunned by the village. He grew used to the whispers and fearful looks whenever others saw his horned visage and ice-white hair and skin. He was lonely for others his own age, but his mother ensured he always felt loved. A series of bad harvests during his teenage years saw the villagers looking for a scapegoat for their misfortune and eventually a violent mob brought torches and pitchforks to burn them out. The youth fled for his life, as the mob fell on his mother. Hiding his demonic heritage beneath stolen armour, he spent several years alternately guarding caravans and stealing from them. What truly drove him, however, was prevention of the kind of ignorant superstition that destroyed his home, and his lessons were not gentle.  Stories of the armoured one grew more numerous, and Arashi began to see himself as a force of nature, a hammer wielded by the Lord of Storms himself.  Moving from place to place and job to job, always hiding his demonic appearance, Arashi Stormborn delivers divine wrath to the unjust.

He was groomed for command, but always demurred with the reply that he was focused on his daughters and their welfare. When the last and youngest of his girls married only a year after his wife's death, everyone expected Edmaris would finally accept his commission and join the military leadership of Marisia. Instead, the middle-aged triton resigned from the guard, packed a few belongings and left for the surface world. Free of his responsibilities, Edmaris is finally able to indulge his wanderlust. He moves from place to place, selling his martial skills to mercenary companies or in the gladiatorial arena, marvelling at the wonders of the surface world. With few needs and an insatiable curiosity, Edmaris seeks adventure.

Amanal like!9/19/2017 1:34:54,Khalkeus,Human,Artificer,"When he was 17, Kalkheus started working with his master, a draconian artificer and master engineer called Jinroth. Jinroth taught him his craft over several long years. He was not, however, alone in this - his master had another apprentice, a half-elf by the name of Elqarim. Elqarim was the son of a noble, and Kalkheus always secretly assumed that he had bought his way into his master's workshop. Kalkheus was never a man of means, so there was always a disconnect between them, stemming both from Kalkheus 's jealousy and Elqarim's haughtiness. Elqarim would always act superior to Kalkheus, and was always one-upping him, much to Kalkheus 's chagrin. While Jinroth liked to think he treated both apprentices equally, he always seemed to work Kalkheus harder, and his criticism was harsher even when it wasn't nearly as deserving as Elqarim. Mostly, Jinroth was scared of any repurcussions from Elqarim's family, as they were very influential. Eventually, both apprentices were skilled enough to be recognised as proper artificers. Finally, their invention contests would come to an end...or so Kalkheus thought.Afterwards, Kalkheus received no immediate work and so furthered his studies for a year. Eventually, Kalkheus spent many years as a sailor on a ship, travelling the coast from port to port. He worked under Captain Orvelle Fogwatcher, a female human. The long days at sea gave him ample time to tinker on and off, and the hard work kept him physically fit. His inventions occasionally helped operation of the ship, which earned him favor with his captain and crew, whose work was made marginally easier. Any engineering problems on the ship were also his domain. His reason for the life of the sea was to discover artefacts. Sailors traverse great destinations across the land, and port cities are fountains of information. Unfortunately, his old apprentice rival had his money in more pockets than even the trade winds could reach, and every opportunity Kalkheus discovered was a bust - for him. Elqarim was once again one-upping Kalkheus, this time with his magical discoveries.Determined to show his nemesis up, Kalkheus decided he needed to do away with his familiar sailor life and get his hands dirty if he was going to harness unknown magic and powerful objects to expand his craft, receive recognition and unravel mysteries known to no others. He left the ship behind, much to the disappointment of the crew. He had grown rather close to them, especially his captain and while there was regret in leaving, he knew his desire to discover and his pride would not let him stay."9/19/2017 1:41:50,Gordito,Human,Akhasic Mage,"Gordito grew up in the Central Valley.  His parents had managed to buy a little house in town, with steady work supervising a couple of square miles of orchard and working in a restaurant.  Their ambition was to get their kids, Gordito and his younger sister, to attend college.Gordito fulfilled that dream.  He'd become fascinated by Japan in high school, and found the language easier than his teachers expected for someone raised on Spanish and English.  His teacher guided him to a language scholarship at San Francisco State instead of track at Fresno; suggesting he might become a translator.  The big city brought aikido and kung fu and comparative linguistics; and running up steep hills late at night, stopping to try to help a few of the people left behind on the street by the economic disruption of technocracy.  He had a foreign exchange trip to Japan in his senior year, the first one in his family to go abroad, and his aikido teacher Kenji suggested he stop by a particular monastery in the mountains outside Kyoto where ""they might let you do their training"".At the monastery, they didn't know what to do with the gaijin who didn't have an accent and who didn't want to leave.  Eventually a young-looking master in an old-looking robe said he could stay - if he could run the monastery's marathon meditation course around the mountain at night.  That's when things got weird.  He ran that course in half of the time he'd ever run that far before, in the dark, without ever misstepping.  It was as if he could see the path through his feet, and skip every other step.  Then the master came, and told him of the Akhasic fellowship and who he had been.""A fellow's avatar passes from themselves to another after they die, as for all but the nonreturners.""  She gestured him through the ritualistic pouring of the tea.  ""Some who have awakened into the Akhasic or other traditions in a past life we find when they are children.  Some we do not find for many lifetimes.  You were Hayato in your last life.  Kenji thought you were one of us, and that you might awaken here.""He stayed there a while, to the mixed disappointment of his professors and his parents when he missed graduation.  But eventually, he came back to San Francisco.  Even as he learned Akhasic discipline, right perception, right mindfulness, and how martial arts could be refined into the Way; he realized that he could not let go of the street - he was not a nonreturner yet.  He bunked at Kenji's dojo, helping to hide it and its students from the Technocracy, and dropped the prospect of translating for corporations in favor of training as a paramedic.If the Technocracy could not be stopped in this lifetime, some if its harm could be limited by saving those harmed by it.  And perhaps they would step towards enlightenment, and realize their own liberation."9/19/2017 1:42:55,Clover,Half-orc,Paladin,"She was found as an infant in a patch of clover by a human family. Her dead mother was covering her the best she could.

She was raised and taught alongside their own daughter, and trained to be a companion and body guard to the daughter, but she was treated like a family member for the most part. When she was a teenager she ran an errand for the family to another town. During her absence a band of raiders killed her adoptive family.

This Fey was able to take advantage of her innocence to strike up a bargain with her. When she was finally released and allowed to head home she realized what she had done. She did not know what would happen to her or what she might be convinced to do now, so fearing for the lives of her family she went home and pretended all was well until she could pack up some supplies and sneak out of the house.

He managed to get into a life raft, grabbing a few supplies and fishing gear to improve his meagre chance of survival.As he escaped the sinking wreckage, Verguldi caught sight of a large military ship far away. It continued on its way though it must surely have seen the smoking wreckage. As he began to row, Verguldi saw the ships mascot, a weasel called Fretten, swimming from the wreckage. He scooped it up and carried it with him in the life raft, eventually keeping it as a pet. After many days at sea, with nothing to keep him alive but the strange and frequently toxic fish and plant life he pulled from the Void Sea and none to keep him sane but Fretten and his old harmonica, Verguldi arrived at Doskvol, but was turned away from the shipping gates. Almost dead, he was hauled out of the ocean and cared for by the Lighthouse Keeper, Celene Langor. With no home or money and barely any belongings, Verguldi soon fell into a life of crime among the docks using his skills learned manning ships and protecting them from pirates and other dangers."9/19/2017 2:21:11,Jahandar Deniz,Human,Cleric,"Raised by a wealthy family in the lands of Terkea (somewhat similar to Greece/Ottoman empire, mediterranean peninsula, known for commerce and ancient studies), he started studying as cleric of Egeo, god of seas, and soon departed as on board cleric for various ships.

I never knew my father, since he died during childbirth of an unrelated heart attack.I always had a love for the arts; dabbling in poetry, painting and ballet before falling in love with the art of mime. My tutor was a halfling named Cedric Tallbottom. I learned from him through my late teens until, at the age of 23, I was discovered by a theatre owner named Jhessail Ramondo. She allowed me to perform at her theatre for free, though we split the profits. The turnout and crowd reception amazed me and from that moment I devoted myself fully to my art. I vowed to never leave character and to entertain people wherever I went.After the show I noticed a young scruffy looking man (Maxime El Cuervo) steal a coin purse from a well-dressed old lady. To my surprise he then came to speak to me, apparently a big fan. I motioned for him to return the purse but did not tell anyone of the crime. We bonded over that moment and Maxime became a regular at my shows.

Her father a blacksmith and her mother a revered member of the towns guard. She also had a sister a few years younger than her, Abby. Lillian and Abby were very close. They did everything together growing up including training with their mother to defend themselves and a bit of blacksmithing with their father.As they grew older they both made other friends. They still shared their bond but didn't see each other as much. Lillian grew close with two of her friends, Elaine a human girl and Tristan a half elf boy. She treated them like she would her sister. Abbys friends seemed strange and Lillian saw her less and less. One day Lillian was invited to the local tavern with her friends. She told them she would be there later as she needed to help her dad with some smithing. While outside on a break from her work she heard screams coming from the tavern. She ran over as fast as she could. She entered the tavern and it was pitch black, suddenly she is tackled and pinned against a wall. It's her sister, but she wasn't the same. Abby was about to kill her but at the last moment released her and ran away. Lillian collapsed to the ground only to realize everyone in the tavern was dead and blood leaked everywhere. Among the dead was Elaine and Tristan still wearing the jewellery Lillian once made them.The town mourned the dead including lillian's friends. She didn't have the heart to tell her parents that it was Abby. Instead they thought bandits has done it and that Abby had been kidnapped and killed else where. Lillian was destroyed. She had lost her best friends as well as her sister. She decided to join the town guard along with her mother and train in combat. She trained for roughly a year or so every single day never forgetting what happened. In her line of work she was tasked a few times with catching a thief or bandit but in her anguish would often kill the person she was hunting. During this time she would read in the library to find out more about what her sister had become. She learnt of vampires but also learnt about holy knights who swore a oath of vengeance. After a year of training and working for the guard she decided to swear such an oath to kill her sister and whoever made her what she became. With all her training and study she was ready to begin her journey. She told her parents she was leaving to travel and sell her jewellery but the real reason was far more sinister."9/19/2017 3:07:06,Rono,Human,Fighter ,"Rono was once engaged to a princess, but through certain events he ended up very, very far away from her.

The personal bodyguards of the Royal family were drawn from six houses, the Valon among them. These guards were trained in the powerful art of bladesinging, and forbidden from letting it be revealed to anyone outside their families. When the Crown was succeeded by the Theocracy, the Royal Guard was disbanded. Generations have now passed, but the Valon family has trained the eldest child of each generation in secret to carry on the tradition. Arkas is the latest in this line. He wishes to put his skills to use, rather than have them waste away in seclusion, and has ventured out in search of adventure."9/19/2017 3:33:33,Lucerys Teh'Kinrellz,Drow,Warlock,"  As a son of a minor noble family in Ched Nasad I was apprenticed to a stuffy old wizard, Dresmorlin of House Melarn, at a very young age. There I met Kiara, the 5th daughter of a minor priestess of House Melarn and half a year younger than me and we became fast friends immediately, even though she was a female of a more noble house. She, however, had no interest in becoming a priestess of Lolth and was more interested in swordplay and war magic and so we met in the practice yard and the library and our friendship grew.  Although I am of above average intelligence, very curious and not untalented I lacked the focus and commitment to make it as a wizard and this and my low birth caused my master to neglect and mistreat me.  Over the years I learned the basics of magic, delved deeply into history and honed my reasoning and deduction skills. My friendship with Kiara slowly grew into love, a rare thing for our people and thus we kept it a secret.  One day, about a month ago, I found an ancient book of summoning rituals in the wizard's library and decided to try them out. The first ritual summoned a quasit, which proceeded to wreck the alchemy lab and left behind a small brass orb etched with strange symbols. Encouraged, I decided to try the ritual on the loose leaf at the back with the mad scribbles in the margin. When at first nothing happened, I was disappointed, but I suddenly felt an alien presence pressing on my mind and a voice told me that if I could survive the nightmares, I would be allowed to live.  In these nightmares I was constantly stalked by something huge slithering just outside my peripheral vision. I learned the two spells and one cantrip that I know, the Dissonant Whispers spell is just a reflection of my own experience and the Armour of Agathys spell and the Chill Touch cantrip come from inscriptions I came across in my dreams: the Armour of Agathys I found inscribed into the a cuirass, Chill Touch into the palm of a withered hand. Eldritch Blast was scribbled into the margin of the paper with the ritual that summoned my patron.  That night I packed my things, including the book and the loose parchment, said goodbye to Kiara and left for the surface world and adventure. My goals, that I hope to achieve through these adventures, are to learn who my patron is, and with my new found power, to gather riches, knowledge (especially of the forbidden and forgotten sort) and to gain enough power and experience to avenge myself on my former master."9/19/2017 3:40:56,Rickon,Human,Barbarian,"  I come from the far northern mountains, specifically a village of humans near a dwarven mine. I was orphaned when I was five years old, when my village was attacked by goblins, bugbears and hobgoblins.  I was captured and lived in slavery among the goblinoids for seven years. I managed to escape when I stole back my father's knife, that he had given to me just as the goblins attacked our village to defend myself with and that a goblin had taken at my capture. I used it to slit my jailer's throat and steal the keys and then slit a few more goblin throats in my rage while escaping.  I have since then lived on my own in the wild, learning to hunt, fish, keep warm, not get lost and defend myself. I have been killing goblinoids if I come across them and have thus picked up a little money and a bit of equipment.  My temper had manifested quite early in my life. Even before the goblin attack I was know as wilful and wild and both my parents had terrible tempers - they both killed large numbers of goblins and even bugbears, and my father even took down two hobgoblins all on his own.  My captors soon found out about my rages and after whipping and starving didn't cure me of it, they decided to use me for their entertainment: I was forced to fight in the pits. This, however, helped me with my escape since it gave me much training in fighting, both against animals and humanoids (I was a regular training exercise for young goblins).  Recently, the horde of goblinoids that destroyed my village have started expanding the territory they control southwards, driving people and beasts before them. I have thus been forced to move south, into more civilised lands.  I have since decided that maybe I can find some other people to help me deal with this threat and hope to find them in these more settled areas."9/19/2017 4:08:46,Jeremy,human,sorceror,He's a cultist trying to collect the scattered bones of his deceased mentor so he can bury them. Said bones were scattered by his pet dog Gus while his back was turned.9/19/2017 4:42:34,Eaghan Holt,Human,Ranger,"Eaghan Holt was born in the year 4361 FR, when the Bloodbone warband started invading Beleroth. His father was a ranger who lived near the eastern border with his family to keep eyes on the movements of the Orcs. As the warband started pushing further and further west, they were forced to move west as well. When Eaghan was old enough (about 10 probably) his father started teaching him how to handle a bow, and how to survive in the wilderness (basically how to be a ranger like his father). As he grew older and learned more he started joining his father in his expeditions.As the warband pushed further and further they eventually wound up in the capital, where they stayed for as long as possible while Aldyn continued to teach Eaghan. Eventually, near the end of the siege Moreen convinced them to flee from the capital before it was too late, for the sake of Eoin who had been born about a year before. Eaghan was insistant on not leaving Beleroth behind however. His uncle Morris had told him of a resistance movement being formed by Lady Kathleen Hane and intended to follow his uncle in joining it. Much argueing ensued. Moreen wanted to go to the camps to ensure the safety of both her children. Aldyn admired Eaghan's spirit but placed his family's safety first. Eventually it was decided that Eaghan would go with Morris to join the resistance, while the rest of his family would go south to the dominion, to one of the camps.In the following years he was guided mostly by his uncle. While his father mostly taught him about stealth, archery and how to survive in the wilderness, Morris educated him in old ways to appease The Giver and request his magical aid (That works right? I'm imagining the components of spells corresponding to mini-rituals of sorts). Eaghan prefered raids at night, since his training and The Giver's magic gave him the advantage over the orcs in the darkness.While he was very devoted to the cause, he also grew impatient. He felt like no progress was being made, and was still bitter about the Dominion's lack of help in resisting the Warband. He reasoned that if they were to give their full support, and every able Belerothi rised up as well, they could beat the Warband. So he planned on leaving Beleroth (for now) and joining the High Shield. He would try to rise up the ranks and try to get the Dominion to invade Beleroth. After a discussion with his superiors, he left for the Dominion. [Would there be any kind of message they'd want him to pass along? I don't know how much contact there is between the resistance and the Dominion]He stopped by one of the northen tent camps where his family was supposed to be. He found that his parents were content to settle down, to his disappointment. He then headed to Fort Laham, to join the ranks of the High Shield. He did a few jobs in the area to prove his worth. One of these jobs was to escort a group of Turian pilgrims down south. [I imagine either they were brought to Laketown or he finished the mission and headed to Laketown for further orders, at which point he meets the party?]"9/19/2017 4:43:01,Distant Star,Tabaxi,Mystic,"Distant star was named after a shooting star that could be seen the night he was born. He showed above average intelligence and an eagerness to learn that got him selected by the mystics of the clan, most importantly his father, to be taught the mystic arts. His main mentor was his own father, Rock on the Mountain (Rock). He took to it well and showed particular interest in the disciplines related to manipulating other minds, mostly out of a kind of scholarly interest (although admittedly he doesn't mind messing with people in non-harmful ways).He started his Journey shortly after he finished his mystic training, and left for the mainland not too sad for leaving his home behind, but rather excited for what the Dominion has to offer.After he landed in Portsmouth he travelled through the land, stopping at practically every tavern he came across to tell stories from his clan and listening to tales from strangers he met, and passing on their stories to others. He wrote down every story, every tidbit of knowledge and lore, personal journal entries recording his journey and everything else he found interesting in a large tome (book of lore from scholar's pack). His idea is that when it is full he will return to his clan with it to share it's contents.He was also very interested in the history of this land, and thus visited many libraries and spend time talking to scholars. This behavior attracted the attention of an agent of The Red Cloaks, a Turian human named Brynstan, who approached Star under the guise of a scholar interested in helping his research in the Dominion's history. They got talking, and eventually the scholar revealed himself to be an agent of The Red Cloaks and offered Star a position in the faction as a Watcher. From what he had learned about the history of the continent and the goals of the Red Cloaks, he felt their cause was just and gladly joined.When he visited Dorwine he also met Marlyn on his way out of the city. After talking and sharing stories (real and fake ones) he remembered some messages offering a job to adventurers and passed it on to Marlyn, who indicated that he was interested in taking it and invited Star to join him in that. Star was not very interested in the job itself, but he did take a liking to this half-elf and decided that he might meet more interesting people on this job, and so he traveled with Marlyn to the Naked Hero."9/19/2017 4:43:21,Perry Spirewood,Human,Druid,"Raised by wolves and is extremely prejudiced against cities in general and city folk he hasn't gotten to know.

The party seeked to enter the Warlock's Crypt to defeat Larloch, find treasure and attain glory.  With her, she had an inherited sentient sword that would for one time, save the sword's wielder from certain death by switching the souls of the wielder and the weapon, breaking afterwards ( if that makes sense ). It is the reason why she survived the initial encounter with Larloch. Her whole adventuring party was either killed or horribly cursed, including her. She, and her whole lineage, was cursed to start decaying rapidly. To prevent the death of her ancestors and herself, she made a deal with Larloch. She would free her relatives of the curse, removing all effects it had had on them. But she herself retained the effects of the curse. Although she isn't decaying anymore, her body is visibly half-rotten, she reeks of death and suffers from malnutrition. Larloch, as a part of the deal, has granted her enough immortality to keep her alive, so she can go around the Realms and do odd jobs for him. Nevy never knows why she is doing the jobs, all she knows that it is what she must do to stay alive. Nevy herself seeks revenge on Larloch, for effectively killing all of her friends and relatives , and cursing her( although some relatives and members of the adventuring party remain, she does not know their location).

One day, Sven was brutally cut down in the course of some gang violence. His parents were never the same again.They could not accept that their darling boy could be killed so senselessly. They mourned, and grieved, and wailed to the gods to right this grievous wrong; no answer came to them. So they sought out diviners and fortune tellers and mystics who all promised to contact their lost child; no answer. So they used all of their money, sold the shop, went into debt with all the wrong people to seek out clerics to bring him back; the rituals all failed. So they turned to darker paths, and sought to pull their son from the depths of the afterlife through strange and unknown magics; and one goddess took note.The Raven Queen does not like necromancy. She does not like those who try to cheat death, or pervert the course of life. Ty never saw his parents again. The Raven Queen does not like necromancy, but she is not a cruel goddess. Ty was now alone, and so the Raven Queen sent him a guardian to keep him on the straight and narrow: a small raven called Allie.With the strength his new ally gave him Ty grew strong living on the streets; he did what he needed to survive, but did his best not to let the Raven Queen's kindness go unnoticed. He was eventually placed into an orphanage where he made friends and found purpose working with an old gnomish chef named Faetra. She taught him everything she knew and gave him a cookbook of his own, one that he keeps with him to this very day. Life was good, for a while.But all good things come to an end. The city of Bubastis was beset by the Chaos Horde, and the orphanage was destroyed. Ty, his friends, and a few of the younger orphans managed to escape the devastation, but the city is not the same. Gangs of scavengers and goblins roam the streets, and small communities have grown like mold in the dark places.Ty and the others have found a town house to hole up in, and have built a small community for themselves. They have a garden and some chickens, but it is not enough to feed them all. Sometimes Ty has to go out and get meat from... other sources. Sabriel can't even eat regular food any more, and needs a special diet that doesn't bear thinking about. His old cookbook is still always on his person, but now its pages have annotations and incantations scribbled in the margins. Ty is pretty sure he didn't write all of them, but who else could have?In recent days his faith has been tested. The church of the Raven Queen has been re-opened after the attack, but the new priest is not who he seems to be. His faith is weak, and his desire for followers is strong. Ty has also been courted by a patron from Below, though his faith in his goddess has not yet been shaken. He just needs to hold everyone together. He can't lose another family..."9/19/2017 5:19:57,Scrimmick L'Hedge,goblin,druid,"As an infant he was collected out of the anthropological zoo collection of the largest and most prestigious institution of learning, by an anthropologist looking to discern whether or not the evilness of goblins was innate or taught. Raised by a human academic in an academy surrounded by learning and wizards was an amazing experience, and to always have it held at arms length from you because you're a goblin is heartbreaking. Never being allowed to learn arcane magic, a major turning point for Scrimmick was a field expedition where they came into contact with an old druid, a gnome, who took to them. Having been shown a thing or two, upon getting back to the academy they tore through every book they could find with information on druidic magic, and signed up for every field expedition they could, eventually getting a proper grasp of druidic magic and striking out on their own."9/19/2017 5:20:23,Thull,Half-Orc,Monk,"Found in woods as child, raised by human Monk master in secluded village, one day the Master disappears..."9/19/2017 5:23:53,Athorn,Human,Ranger,9/19/2017 5:53:23,Bo Daggit,Human,Ranger,"He has amnesia, cannot remember his past.

This got them out of a lot of tight jams seeing as they did not have natural healing abilities, and the time jumps made running away a bit easier for them, though they could only use the bracelets once every minute.One day Lorif found what appeared to be a solid cloud. They eventually were able to figure out that it was actually a piece of technology that you could fly on by standing on it and using your feet to direct it. Wanting to test fly it they headed outside. and while they are doing so they realize they could get off Laputa and go to the main land.

With their dark eyes, pale skin and brooding demeanour it was either that or vampires. However the de'Valis are an ancient clan who are almost fanatically obsessed with escaping their dark origins, the ancient de'Valis joining with Pelor, God of Life and Summer in an attempt to burn away the darkness of their past. For centuries, it seemed to work, with Veronika's mother, Merletta, giving birth to Victor, Francis and Theon, Veronika's brothers without issue. However, that all changed on Veronika's 1st name day, during the de'Valis ritual of atonement. Designed to cleanse the child's soul and bind it to Pelor, a raven perched on her crib, interrupting the ritual and turning a strand of her golden hair black, marking her as under The Raven Queen's protection. The Elders, fearing for the child, locked her away and rigidly trained her in the healing arts, hoping it's light would free her soul from The Raven's grasp. However, Veronika, seeing her brothers' freedom, grew bitter and resentful towards those she saw as honouring their title over family.She was freed, however, on her 18th name day, when the ritual was attempted again. This time, The Raven Queen herself descended, shaming the family for dishonouring their blood, forcing her into a life she wasn't destined to lead. The family tried to plead their love for Veronika, saying that they were only trying to keep her from the darkness and pain of the world, but her bitterness wouldn't allow her to heed their words and she followed her ancestor to Letherna within The Shadowfell, a realm of Darkness and Shadow. Finally inheriting her true powers, but ignorant, The Raven Queen soul-bound Veronika to the soul of an adventurer in a far flung realm of the Primaterial Plane, the dashing Elven rogue, Vy'dan Vexalis, allowing them to converse across the cosmos. Through him, Veronika learnt the combat of darkness, to use stealth and shadow to destroy the Undead that stood as an affront to both The Raven Queen and Pelor. Tragedy struck when Vy'dan was felled by a great necromancer and raised as a ghoul. The stress of the broken connection and the sorrow at her friend's loss, both physically and spiritually, had a profound effect on Veronika. Unable to avenge him, or release him from his torment, she fell to the Sorrow of The Shadowfell, her golden hair fading to ash as the light and life were drained from her. In hopes of saving her life and restoring her light, The Raven Queen sent her back to the Material Plane and her family. However, upon returning to her temple, she found it abandoned, profaned with the symbols of Orcus, God of Undeath and enemy to The Raven Queen. Shamed by her callous dismissal of her family's love, Veronika vowed to find them, and avenge them if need be."9/19/2017 7:36:19,Gideon,Half-elf,Paladin,"brought up poor in the inner spirenever knew her father, mother died when she was 14orphaned, trying to make a living and a home for herself, she grew to resent the wealthy merchants of the spire who dressed so warmly and never went hungryshe fell quite happily into piracy, taking by force what she had tried so hard to earn ‘fairly’over the course of a decade, she worked her way through the ranks on the wind dagger until she was made navigator. she was content, guiding her crew through the treacherous skies, and earning the respect and even affection of her captain, an older elf woman named aviv who was quick with a smile and quicker with a dagger; and her quartermaster, a gruff gnome woman named ebele whose enemies lived to underestimate her only oncethey took what they needed from merchant ships, plus a little more to fence for extra coin. nurit had a good, exciting life. she and her crew protected each other, and they were the closest thing to a family she had known for a long timeon a day like any other, ebele led the attack against a merchant ship like any other. nurit followed, cutting down crew in her way, until she had cut her way to a tall human woman in worn but well-cared-for plate mail, laying her hands on someone nurit had just mortally slashed. this was not a pampered merchant, indeed, this was a woman whose face told of kindness and whose armor told of hardship. however, she was between nurit and her goal of leaving this ship with the goods aboard, so they clashedthe armored woman was strong, but nurit was fast, and that slight advantage was enough to leave a breathless nurit holding her blade at the woman’s throat. the woman stilled, looked searchingly into nurit’s eyes, then smiled beatifically and pulled a pouch from her belt to drop onto the ship’s floor. feeling inexplicably overcome, nurit found her wits enough to cut the woman’s throat and, half in a daze, pushed her over the ship’s rail. she stared unseeing at the woman’s falling body until another of the merchant’s guard attacked, and she threw herself back into the melee. after ebele had secured the ship’s cargo, nurit nearly tripped, then saw that her boot had caught on the armored woman’s pouch, so she attached it to her own belt and returned to the wind daggerfor a week, she was too unsettled to look in the pouch. she barely slept, haunted by the woman’s calm smile just before her death. she eventually talked herself into it - it’s only a purse, what is she so afraid of - and discovered a bit of coin and a leatherbound journal. nurit read the journal of the woman she had killed and she was spellbound. her name was gideon, and she had been a paladin in the service of avandra. she traveled among and within the spires, healing people in exchange for a meal or hiring her sword to protect travellersnurit’s poor sleep worsened for weeks, and her focus and stamina suffered greatly. aviv and ebele expressed their concern, but she waved them off. she attended to her duties the best she could, but the crew had begun to look at her askancethe next time the wind dagger docked at the spire, nurit took up her pack, and gideon’s purse, and walked. she walked aimlessly around the spire, neither seeing nor caring where she was going. she found herself at an inn and realized how hungry she was - she must have been walking for hours. when the innkeep asked for her name, she answered ‘gideon,’ and she slept through the night for the first time in over a monthnow, she uses gideon as a surname and few if any know her as nurit. she has dedicated herself to avandra, and tries every day to do some small good to assuage her guilt over killing a good woman"9/19/2017 7:41:50,Ariché,human,swashbuckler,"Kidnapped from her tribe in South America, Ariché grew up as a slave on a plantation.

The scandalous affair and pregnancy wasn't able to be hidden by house Demara, due to Haisa being too indiscreet about both.After Eyrdway was born (on May 21st, of 487 AD) his mother was cast out of their house and married off to a ""low-class"" wood elf merchant, Thema Brimo, who was a rich member of the Alchemist's Guild.  Eyrdway grew up in comfort, with tales of elves from his mother and interest in the pursuit of knowledge from his step-father.As Saxifrage had need to visit the libraries of Arkanne with some regularity he would contact Haisa when he stayed in Haynhold, but only in secret.  The most Eyrdway ever knew was that Thema wasn't his birth father, but the topic was not discussed in the household further than that, despite Eyrdway's curiosity about his heritage.Eyrdway began an apprenticeship to an skilled alchemist friend of his father, Kashban Beatbrass, at the age of twelve.  By the age of 18, having become a skilled alchemist, he was imbued with his wild magic sorcerous powers when his master was working with a wizard named Yendri to experiment on a pot of paint from a set of Nolzur's Marvelous Pigments, only to have the work be destroyed in a magical explosion that killed them and grievously injured Eyrdway.  Unknown to Eyrdway at the time was that Carathros, a wizard rival of Yendri, had used a subtle enchantment on Kashban, which caused Kashban to unconsciously sabotage the experiment.While the resources of Eyrdway's family resources kept him from immediately dying from his injuries, he remained severely burned and in a near coma.  Thus Haisa used a scroll of Sending that Saxifrage had given her and, in secret, Saxifrage arranged for a cleric friend of his to volunteer his services for Eyrdway's benefit.  After the magical healing, it still took many months for Eyrdway to recover. He was left with a hand-sized burn scar over his heart.Half-way through his nineteenth year, strange events began to occur around him and he slowly realized that he was the cause, thanks to a pulsing that would occur in his scar when the events would happen.  By the time he was twenty, several wild magic surges had happened and few were dangerous enough that he sought out help from wizards in Haynhold.  Through their study and knowledge, he discovered his sorcerous nature and despite their misgivings (and with some ""donations"" from Thema) they quickly taught him enough to allow him to rein in his powers, or so he thought.Thinking that his problems were past him, Eyrdway tried to start an alchemist's shop in his twenty-second year. Sadly, in his twenty-fourth year, he found that his powers began manifesting without his ability to control them again.  The wizards refused to help him any more, as they did not want the possible side effects of wild magic to bring harm upon them.  Somewhat thankfully, Eyrdway realized that he could keep the wild magic manifestations at bay by casting his spells (but not his cantrips) regularly, upon actual targets.Thus, in his 24th year, he sold his alchemist's shop and turned to adventuring.  Eyrdway's first adventuring group consisted of Sharplin, a wood elf ranger; Amook, a wood elf druid; and Kalya, a half-elf paladin.  Their adventures took them underground, against various denizens of the Underdark that were causing issues for the villages and farms around Haynhold.  After a couple months of successful adventuring, their group (the Lithe Runners) were defeated by a drow ambush deep underground.  Eyrdway only escaped thanks to a potion of invisibility.Disheartened from loosing adventuring companions, Eyrdway wanted to take some time off from adventuring.  One of treasures that he had managed to escape with was a wizard's spellbook and something about it drew him too it.  Eyrdway discovered that, for reasons beyond his comprehension, his attempts to study the spells in the book helped keep his need to cast his spells daily at bay.  He attempted to pursue rigorous magical learning in Haynhold, but the wizards there were even more wary of a Wild Mage that had grown beyond his initial power and they would not help him at all.Eyrdway was not skilled enough to teach himself what he needed and his attempts to manipulate (and sometimes charm) people into helping him drew the ire of Carathros.  In his arrogance, Carathros revealed his place in Eyrdway's fate, but thanks to a wild surge, Eyrdway was able to escape his clutches.  Under pursuit by Carathros and fearing for his life Haisa was once again able to contact Saxifrage.  The powerful Enchanter teleported to Haynhold and, with Haisa revealing to Eyrdway that Saxifrage was his father, whisked Eyrdway away to the far-away city of Hinuedon.In Hinuedon, Saxifrage was able to trade in some favors, from his many years of diplomatic travel, to have Eyrdway learn the basics of ritual magic from wizards he knew there.  Saxifrage could only stay with Eyrdway for a few days, however. He left Eyrdway with enough resources to complete his education in ritual magic, along with a Bag of Holding that he no longer had a use for and then had to return to the Republic of Huly.With new-found abilities and tools, a new familiar, and a reference from one of Saxifrage's friends, Eyrdway decided to try his hand at adventuring again.  He was in a strange new land and would have to make his fortune there.  He also wanted to stay out of well-known areas, to keep the ire of Carathros at bay."9/19/2017 8:01:10,Tegwyn Meadowsweet,Elf,Warlock,"Tegwyn grew up in an idyllic wood elf village.

He was raised until the age of 12 in the house of his maternal grandfather, Seaian Dryadson. Upon reaching maturity, he was sent to the High Forest to learn the ways of the Wood Elves and become a ranger like his elvish father.As the bastard child of a noble lady, Thoren spent his entire life as an outsider. Rejected by the human children of Anganor, Thoren spent his childhood training for his eventual return to the forest of his father. He spent much of his childhood in the wwoods on the borders of his grandfathers estate, honing his skills as an archer, and tracker. Thoren was raised, primarily, by Tyrus Vicelord, the head of his grandfathers Houseguard. As a Half-elf, Tyrus and his family, were the closest thing Thoren had to a family during his formative years. Though his grandfather allowed him to live on his estate, he was never treated as a member of the Dryadson clan, and upon reaching maturity, he took the name of the man he considered his true father.Upon reaching the High Forest, Thoren was faced with adapting to a society that was wary of the outside, as well as his heritage. His father, Jamros Woodsoul, was, during his life, the greatest Ranger in his clan. Being renowned both inside the High Forest, and among the humans of neighboring cities for his abilities. His renown as a tracker is what led him to meet Thoren’s mother, Lyanna Dryadson, while adventuring through Anganor. Their torrid, short-lived, affair produced little more than their bastard son. Jamros, though not married upon Thoren’s birth, refused to leave the High Forest to rear his son, striking an agreement with Lyanna’s father, instead, to take the boy when he reached maturity, thus ending any responsibility the Dryadson clan had for Thoren. Thoren met his father for the first time on the eve of his 13th birthday, when Jamros ventured to Anganor to fulfill his debt to the Dryadson clan, and return with his son to the village of Ethyreen, deep in the High Forest.Upon his arrival in Ehtyreen, Thoren was met with derision, most poignantly from his father’s wife, who cared no more for his mixed heritage than had his grandfather. Jamros’ other children, as full blooded Feywild, were always given favor over their bastard half-brother, causing Thoren to retreat even deeper in to the development of his skills. His half-brothers (Yennan, Thoros, and Traster) were destined to follow in the footsteps of their maternal grandfather, all three becoming Clerics of Melora. Jamros’ adventuring had left them, often, without a male influence other than their grandfather, and they had all sworn off their fathers occupation by the time of Thoren’s arrival (though none had reached maturity at the time). Though Thoren was not accepted by his wife, or the two eldest boys Yennan and Thoros, his youngest half-brother Traster took an instant shine to his older brother, and was the lone source of sibling affection Thoren had.At the time of Thoren’s arrival, Jamros had become reclusive, choosing to spend his time, primarily, in a small lodge away from the family his wife, Irann, had assumed control over the family. Irann, a daughter of Elven nobility, had not taken kindly to the offer of her hand to Jamros, who was the son of a bard, in return for the rescue of her youngest brother, Traster, from a Drow clan that had made several raids in to the High Forest near Ethyreen. Jamros, who was approaching the age of ninety at the time (shortly after Thoren’s birth) had accepted the offer primarily out of the duty to preserve his line, as he was the last of his name.Irann had never taken to Jamros’ adveturesome lifestyle, preferring the safety and security of the Wood Elf’s haven in the High Forest. His absentism had led to a rift, especially after Traster’s birth, that drove them apart, leading to Jamros’ self-imposed exile to his hunting lodge. Though he, initially, brought Thoren to the home of his wife, when Thoren’s training began, they lived for months at Feyrun (his fathers lodge deep in the forest). Jamros’ taught Thoren everything he could about tracking, archery, two-handed fighting, and inundated his eldest child with stories of his years in the world of men. Though, eventually, Thoren grew to love his father, he was never able to forgive his fathers abandonment, and refused to adopt the Woodsoul name, refusing, even at his fathers deathbed, to relinquish the name of the only family he ever had.Upon his father’s death, Thoren left Feyrun and returned to Anganor, reuniting with Tyrus Vicelord just months before his passing. His “brother”, Tytran, a bard of some renown in the Human cities of the low plains, encouraged him to ply his skills in the Human cities in the north, where there was much need for skilled trackers. Tytran, who’s travels had taken him far above the Neck, led his “brother” Thoren off towards Winterfell, where, on his 20th birthday, he encountered a small band of adventurers looking for a tracker to lead them through Wintershold forest.As a young child, Thoren was visited by a member of his father, Jamros’, clan in he woods near his Grandfathers’ estate. The man, who did not give his name, but called himself Thoren’s Uncle, told Thoren that he must grow to be the man his father could not be.Not long after Thoren began his formal training with his father, he was targeted for “education” by his younger brothers (save Traster). His brothers, Yennan and Thoros, slipped a non-lethal amoung of nightshade in to his bread, leaving Thoren poisoned and near death for several days. As a result, Thoren is overly suspicious and will rarely eat anything he did not make himself.Before setting out with his “brother” Tytran on the adventure that brought him to Winterfell, Thoren had a brief, life-changing, encounter with the daughter of his Grandfather’s stable-master, Yehreena. Though he will not admit it openly, he dreams regularly of eschewing the vocation his father imparted on him."9/19/2017 8:24:43,Zûkhwlaaey Sharptooth,half-orc,bard,"Zûkhwlaaey grew up in a typical orcish tribe in the frozen north, the child of an accomplished huntress and a human herbalist who had been adopted by the tribe as a lost child. When Zûkhwlaaey returned from completing their adulthood tasks (most importantly, killing a bear on their own), they found their village razed to the ground and their tribe gone. Not having the marks of adulthood, but also not being able to repeat their tasks (killing a bear binds its spirit to yours, and binding more than one inevitably leads to them tearing your spirit apart between them), Zûkhwlaaey was forced to leave orcish society altogether, and has been wandering more or less southwards, doing odd jobs and performing music to scrape a living, ever since."9/19/2017 8:24:45,Farryn Brightwater,Half-Elf,Wizard,"The Brightwaters are an old, well-established trading family that transports goods back and forth from their home port in Memnon and along the southern trade routes. The strict tradition in the trading families of this region is that the first-born son into a sailing family is committed to the family’s ship, which means they are taken away from their mother as soon as they are weaned and grow up on the family ship. Starting from a very young age, they learn every aspect of life at sea and are expected to become proficient (or at least capable) in them all. On their 20th birthday, they go through a blood bonding ceremony with the ship and become First Mate under their father, and later Captain when their father either dies or steps down. In the absence of a son in the family, the responsibility falls to the youngest daughter – this is less than ideal, as it can create situations where the daughter is much older than the traditional heir, but it is also extremely uncommon as the trading families tend to produced large and hardy families.  Farryn Brightwater is the third daughter born to Captain Remi Brightwater and his wife, Liaroris Brightwater (neé Vyshaan). Remi and Liaroris had an arranged marriage by which their parents intended to improve trade prospects between the two families. Remi and Liaroris were cordial but there was never a great affection between them and Remi was away at sea for most of their marriage. Liaroris did become pregnant quickly, but as she was an elf carrying half-humans, she was only able to bear three living offspring -- all girls – and had very difficult pregnancies. After almost dying when Farryn was born, healers ordered her not to fall pregnant again or it would surely kill her. Thus, at the age of three, Farryn was grudgingly taken away from her mother and two older sisters and brought to live and work on the Brightwater’s family ship, the Cascade. Her daily care fell to a sulky cabin boy who knew nothing about children, so Farryn had to learn to fend for herself quite quickly. At first Farryn was very homesick for her mother and her two older sisters, Mialee and Shava, who had doted over their baby sister. Each trading cycles lasts about three months, and as she was still expected to perform her duties onboard the Cascade even in Memnon, she was only allowed a week leave from the ship to be in the family home when the ship was in port. Despite her ambivalence toward her husband, Liaroris was a warm mother who genuinely loved her daughters and was distraught over Farryn being taken away. The visits for the first few years were very emotional and bittersweet. But after a while, each visit became more and more like polite visits with strangers. Farryn saw how close her sisters became to each other and their mother and how much she missed during the time she was away. After awhile she only came home for shorter visits of a day or two.For many years Farryn worked hard on the Cascade. Her father always seemed disapproving no matter how well she did, so she threw herself into her work and kept pushing harder and harder. She started out as a cabin boy, running errands for crew. As she was waiting to grow and get stronger, she also took her turns assisting the cook in the galley, working as a nurse under the healer, and assisting shipwrights with repair as the needs arose. When she was old enough, she started working as a crew member, manning the sails, cleaning the ship, aiding with repairs, keeping watch, helping load and unload cargo. She learned how to balance cargo, how to operate the catapults on deck, the record keeping necessary for trading, navigation and map charting, and star reading. By her early teens she was doing rounds with the first mate on his daily ship inspections to be sure tasks are completed and everything is running efficiently, repairs are done correctly, etc. Over the years, the other shipmates didn’t know how to relate to her, as she was not only the Captain’s daughter but also female. But she consistently pulled her weight and more, and thus earned their grudging respect and eventually their cautious affection. She was happy with this until her mid-teens when she began to visit other family ships with her father to learn the business of trading. It was then she realized that on ships with male heirs the crew had much more respect and deference, and that the heir was truly treated as the future captain instead of like a mascot. She privately despaired of ever becoming the type of leader that she would need to be in order to command that type of respect. She knew that she would have to work three times as hard as a male in her position would, which made her all the more determined to be the best she could.   When Farryn was sixteen, her mother became very sick. Healers from around the trade route were transported to Memnon and finally, when it seemed there was nothing anyone could do, Farryn’s great-grandfather, the wizard Lianthorn Vyshaan, was transported from his home in Velen to be with his daughter. He was a private and reclusive old man who spent most of his time onboard in his cabin. But when he was on deck or at dinner, Farryn noticed him starting at her intently several times. This scared her a little, so she tried to avoid him after that. Her mother eventually passed away and after the funeral and mourning period, the Cascade started out on the trade route with Lianthorn on board, although this time he stayed exclusively in his cabin and had his meals brought to him. When they were nearing port, the most violent storm Farryn had even seen broke out. The ship was taking on water and sails were tearing and everyone was running around like mad. Even Captain Remi looked worried, which made Farryn terrified. Just when she was sure they would all die at sea, she heard a booming voice and saw her great-grandfather standing on the deck with his arms outspread, casting spells. The violent winds stopped and within a minute the sky above was clear. The water on decks was siphoned neatly back into the sea and with a series of complicated hand gestures the sails were mended and billowed out toward shore again. The decks leveled and Lianthorn looked around slowly, then turned and started shuffling back to his cabin. It was dead silent and the whole crew stood with their mouths open until Captain Remi barked at them to get back to work, as the ship wouldn’t sail itself. Before she returned to her work, Farryn darted over to her great-grandfather and pressed her hand into his. He looked at her with the penetrating gaze again and she felt a tingling in her hand. Then he was back in his room and she didn’t see him again until he debarked in Velen. Later, Farryn overheard a conversation where the other crewmen discussed reverently how amazing the wizard’s feats had been and how they wish they had those powers. But soon they were laughing and imagining how much time it would take to learn and how dull learning wizardry was likely to be. That was when Farryn began to long to become a wizard. She had always been resigned, if not satisfied, that she would eventually become Captain of her beloved Cascade, but for the first time in her life she wished fervently that she wasn’t the ship’s heir. But she was, and there was nothing she could do about it, so she pushed the dream aside as best she could and carried on.Shortly after her mother passed away, a new crew member came on board – a boy the same age as Farryn named West Calabra. The Calabras weren’t a trading family, so it was a little odd, but not completely out of the ordinary. West has to work just as hard as Farryn did to earn the trust and respect of the crew, but in short time he is very well liked. Despite Farryn being a little jealous at how quickly West is accepted by the crew, she can’t help but like him, as he’s very affable and continued to share her work ethic. As somewhat outsiders among the crew, the two became unlikely fast friends. For Farryn, this was the first time in her life that she had a close friend and confidante, which was an amazing feeling. Farryn and West worked side by side, covered each other’s watches when they were sick or exhausted and she began to teach him navigation at his request. He told her about growing up without a father as the only child of a poor bard and she told him about never getting to know her mother and wishing she knew her sisters better. They discussed trading and other ships West has worked on and the best meals they’ve had in ports. Farryn even confessed that although she loves the Cascade and her life at sea, she longs to learn wizardry so she can train to become a Ship’s Wizard and better protect the ship from the stormy seas, sea monsters, and pirates. West didn’t laugh at her like she was afraid he might, but told her earnestly how good she’d be at wizardry. At first, she developed a bit of a crush, but West kept her firmly at arm’s length. Regardless, this was the happiest time in Farryn’s life and for the first time she started to look forward to being Captain of the Cascade with West as her First Mate.The winter before Farryn and West were set to turn 20 (when Farryn would officially take over as First Mate) West’s mother fell ill. He got more worried and withdrawn each time the Cascade stopped in his home port of Calimport. Meanwhile, Farryn got more and more nervous about making the switch to First Mate, worried what it will mean for her friendship with West and relationship to the rest of the crew and whether any of them will take her seriously. Finally, in mid-summer, a month before Farryn’s birthday and days until West’s, the Cascade returned to Memnon. Before disembarking, West cornered Farryn and asked her if she could, would she give up becoming captain of the ship so she could learn wizardry. Surprised and confused, she said yes. West nodded and took her with him to her father’s quarters where he revealed that he is Remi’s bastard son and under the laws of the land is claiming his birthright to become captain of the Cascade. His mother is very sick and needs money for healers, rare medicines, and better quarters.  Farryn and her father were stunned. But before long, the story came out – Remi met West’s mother, Yetta, in Calimport (one of the mainland trading ports) when he was young and training to take over the Cascade from his father. They kept meeting up in Calimport over the years and eventually their friendship turned into love. When Remi found out that his parents were setting up an arranged marriage, he was devastated, but knew he could never ask his parents to marry a poor girl from a non-trading family. He wanted to run away with her but was afraid of his future wife’s great-grandfather, who was a powerful wizard. He went through with the wedding, but still saw Yetta in secret when he could. Remi was miserable and finally told Yetta that seeing her was too painful – Liaroris was pregnant and he had to turn his attentions to her and his future children as best he could. Yetta never told him that she was also pregnant, because she knew that his wife’s family would likely kill him. So she raised her son on her own and never told anyone who his father was, but pined after Remi for all those years. When West was old enough, he asked about his father and she told him the whole story but begged him not to tell anyone. West was curious, so he worked hard on several trading ships and eventually secured a position on the Cascade -- not with any intentions, only so he could get to know his father. His friendship with Farryn was an unexpected but pleasant surprise, and his affection toward his half-sister was genuine. He knew he would never risk hurting her by revealing the truth about his father, so he resolved to work hard enough and hopefully become First Mate one day. But then his mother got sick and forced his hand.Captain Remi became very emotional while listening to this story, and to Farryn’s surprise, he got up and hugged West for a long time. Farryn, who was in shock and felt deeply betrayed by West, ran out of the room and off the Cascade. She asked around and found a foreign merchant ship that was leaving for Velen that afternoon that would give her passage in exchange for her working on the ship. They cast off before her father can find her and before she can lose her nerve. She missed the Cascade terribly, but every time she thought about her father or West her resolve hardened. She got along wonderfully with the crew, who don’t know her true identity, and by the time they arrived in Velen they offered her a job. She was tempted to take it and just disappear forever, but when she looked to the dock, her great-grandfather was standing there waiting for her. She went to him and he looked at her for a long time and then wordlessly lead her back to his sea-side home. She finally asked him if her father had gotten word to him somehow and he said that no, he knew she was coming through his powers. He asked her to tell him what happened. Too afraid to lie, she blurt out the truth and told him she wanted him to teach her wizardry. He was silent for a long time. Farryn wondered if the ship already left, or if she could still take the job working on it. Finally, Lianthorn told her that if she is serious about learning wizardry he will teach her, but in order to prove that she’s a serious student, she must stay in his house and study alone for one full year. If she reads and studies every day for a year, then at the end of the year he will teach her. She was nervous, but agreed to the terms. She was given a room and shown the massive library and then left to her own devices.Farryn, true to her word, began her year of study. After a couple of days of her bumbling around not knowing where to start, Lianthorn began leaving books out for her in the library, although she rarely saw or spoke to him. Her great-grandfather employed a half-orc woman, Umag, who prepared food and kept the house running. Umag spoke mostly Orcish, so Farryn dedicated some time to learning it and they were able to get along well after that. She got the impression that her great-grandfather had helped Umag’s family and she was repaying a life-debt by working for him. Although Farryn was still angry and grieving and lonely and was very unaccustomed to living on land, her days began to take shape – in the mornings she would get up at dawn and study in the library until Umag brought a late brunch and tea. After eating, she would take a walk through the property’s gardens, then back to studying until dinner, which was served at a table and attended infrequently by her great-grandfather. After dinner she would walk down to the shore to stare at the horizon and put her feet in the sea. After week of this routine, Umag came to her and told her that her great-grandfather had a small sailboat that he was willing to let her use. After that she took the boat on the water every day after dinner, regardless of weather. When she returned after her sail, she would tidy her room and read until she fell asleep. One day a week, she ventured down to the port, disguising herself a bit, to get news of the trading families. She learned that her father had reunite with Yetta and that West had bonded to the Cascade. He and her father were running a new trade route together up the Sword Coast. The ship she booked passage with occasionally is in port and tried to convince her to come back to sea, which is tempting at times.She continued like this for the entire year, never missing a day of study, and when the one year anniversary came, Lianthorn was waiting for her in the library and began to teach her the wizardly arts. He was a good and fair teacher, although he was never particularly warm to her. He did catch him looking at her intently at times, which she guessed was because she looked so much like her mother. He did seemed pleased when she progressed quickly and proved a competent wizard, and told her that he knew when he saw her on the ship that he would teach her one day. She asked if her mother knew magic and to her surprise he said yes, but then no more. She stopped talking about her mother and threw herself even more into practice and studies. She still went down to the sailboat every day, and as she learned simple spell and cantrips she practiced mending the sails, shooting firebolts into the sea, and seeing through the eyes of a raven familiar.  She continued to train and become a more powerful wizard, and eventually her great-grandfather told her that her formal training would be done and that in one week, it will be time for her to move on. Farryn had been expecting this and after several years is ready to make her peace with her father and West, so she made arrangements to return to her home. On the day she is set to leave, Lianthorn met her in the library and praised her work ethic and skill, and told her that he was very happy to have had the chance to teach her. As she smiled and thanked him, his demeanor changed and he told her that they never discussed payment. Farryn balked, confused, and her great-grandfather said that it wasn’t her he was seeking payment from, it was her father. She listened horrified while he ranted and raved about the captain that was unfaithful to his favorite granddaughter and broke her heart and then repeated his sins when he cheated his favorite great-granddaughter out of her birthright and similarly broke her heart. Farryn tried to stop him and defend her father, but her pleas fell on deaf ears and before she knew it, he had gone into a type of trance and cast a powerful curse on her father, then stormed out of the room.Farryn hurried home as fast as she could, but Remi was already quite sick by the time she arrived. He seemed relieved to see her, though, and on his deathbed confessed that during her absence, he and West had become involved with a group called the Cult of the Dragon. The Cult paid him to smuggle goods across the Sword Coast. Wracked by guilt, he begged Farryn to promise him that she would investigate the cult and undo the evil he may have helped foster. He urged her to travel to a town called Greenest. Farryn abhorred the thought of being inland for so long when she only just got back, but she also felt extremely guilty about and blamed herself for her father’s death. Immediately after Remi’s burial at sea, she snuck off and secured passage to Candlekeep with a merchant vessel.At the start of our adventure, Farryn is sailing into Candlekeep – it would be a more direct route with more towns along the way if she sailed into Baldur’s Gate, but she’s still trying to process everything that’s happened (her father’s death, finding out he was involved in smuggling for the cult, her grandfather’s betrayal) and has always been uneasy in big cities, so she doesn’t mind camping along the way instead of staying at inns. Plus, she remembers a delicious meal she had in The Burning Wizard tavern in Beregost and Farryn never forgets a good meal. Her plan is to start out in the fortress libraries at Candlekeep to see if she can learn anything out about the Cult of the Dragon and/or Greenest, then take the Way of the Lion path to the Coast Way, where she will head south to Beregost for supplies (and her good meal). She’ll decline to stay in any of the three inns in Beregost and instead elect to camp along the road when she heads south on the Coast Way. Then she’ll continue to head south until she picks up the road into Greenest. "9/19/2017 8:24:45,Celephindor,Half-Elf,Sorcerer ,"Known for its strategic coastal locations and large settlements, the Sword Coast is a prosperous but still very dangerous place to live. Some hundred miles away from the coast itself, protected by the surrounding Shaeradim Mountains is Evereska, one of the Sword Coast's largest settlements. It's known as the last haven of the elves. “Fortress Home” in the common tongue is the last and only standing Elven stronghold in all of Faerun. Encircled by mountains and dense forest, Evereska sits atop a plateau more than 1000 feet above the forest floor making it very difficult for outsiders to get to.Evereska is surrounded by a large magical force known as a mythal that not only acts as a protective barrier but also serves to control weather, regulate sickness and disease, allow large objects to be floated and has many other magical properties. The mythal also allows the citizens of Evereska to climb walls, ceilings and other surfaces like insects. The Eladrin that inhabit Evereska live with and use magic in all its different forms in their daily life. Made up of primarily moon elves, Evereska is no stranger to humans and even a handful of half elves. Tavneiros was known as not only the youngest Eladrin of the high council that governed over Evereska, but the only one to take a human wife. While it was not necessarily looked down upon in their society, Tavneiros was definitely an anomaly among his people. Kine Stokk, Tavneiros’ wife was born to one of the smaller noble houses in Baldurs Gate. A short rather petite figure with creamy pale skin, emerald green eyes and shoulder length auburn curls, Kine stands a striking figure next to her husband's pale blue complexion, raven hair and glowing pupil less blue eyes.One dark night, an ominous arcane storm was brewing over Evereska. It wasn't unheard of that the magic holding the mythal together could be unstable, but it was so rare that most Eladrin may only see one storm like this in their life while others may only hear about them. Tavneiros was apprehensively ecstatic, for Kine was pregnant and just happened to go into labor tonight, but he was unsure if the storm was a good or bad omen. The storm was as beautiful as it was frightening. Shimmering golden drops of rain poured down from dark clouds as bright powerful streaks of purple lightning flashed across the sky. Tavneiros kneeled beside his wife's head, stroking her damp hair in an attempt to soothe her while two priests and a cleric of The Seladrine tended to her other needsA loud crack of thunder boomed drowning out a scream from Kine and just a few minutes later a baby's cry. It's a girl one of the priests said as he presented the child with very Elven features and straight jet black hair just like her father. Another looming boom of thunder and an even louder scream of pain from Kine, the priest surprised held a second child in his arms a boy this time with curly hair like his mother but it was shining silver in the moonlight. As the cleric was starting her blessings of the children, she realized that they had identical birthmarks in the shape of a bird. She knew it was clearly a sign from Aerdrie, the bringer of rain and storms, the Lady of air and wind, the Queen of the Avariel.Growing up as the children of a noble wasn't easy for these two. Rivorthel and Celephindor were afforded many luxuries that other children growing up in Evereska weren't. Even though they were never chastised for being half-elven, their father felt as though he needed to make sure they were smarter, stronger and better taught than all the other children to make up for it. As it was it seemed that the twins were born gifted, touched by the arcane instability of the mythal during their birth. They both had an unnatural affinity for magic and the arcane arts. Most of the other children of Evereska teased them for the amount of time they spent with tutors and reading books that the others couldn't afford. Being teased by all the other children only made them grow closer together the older they got.Shortly after their birth, their mother became very ill. One of the priests ruled that it was most likely due to the level of energy from the mythal present at the time and her human body not being used to or able to handle it. Celephindor or Celeb as his mother called him grew very close to his mother in the few years that she was alive. Eladrin aren't known for having strong emotions and even less for showing them, but Celeb shared his mother's very human range of strong emotions. He let his emotions guide his actions and decisions, probably more than he should have and definitely more than his father liked. Celeb was a very frail child, always much smaller and weaker than his older sister. However none of the elders versed in the arcane arts had ever seen one single person possess so much raw arcane power and with no training or spellbook. As Celeb grew older, he realized his power much like the mythal itself was incredibly powerful but potentially unstable. In an effort to learn to control his powers, Celeb read every book he could get his hands on hoping that if he gained more power he could stabilize his magic. What he found was that he just really enjoyed reading and even though scripts on the arcane arts and history books were his favorite, the subject didn't matter, he just liked to read. He was somewhat of an introvert, often lost in his books and research and found it hard to trust anyone besides his sister.Ever since birth, Rivor felt a strong need to protect her younger brother, even laying into a few of the older boys that took to teasing Celeb about his frailty. After their mother's death, even though she was still a child, Rivor felt terrible that she wasn't able to help in anyway. It was from then on that she knew she would use her powers to help and heal others. She devoted much of her time to learning about The Seladrine, Aerdrie Faenya in particular, who was said to be the cause of the arcane storm that blessed them with their powers. She swore she would never let anything happen to those she loved ever again and with her devotion she became the youngest cleric of The Seladrine in Evereska’s history.Much like her brother, she loved to read and had an affinity for languages. However, most of her time was devoted to religious texts, focusing her arcane prowess in the arts of healing. She took to healing and helping as many people around Evereska as she could. She quickly became known all across Evereska for her ability to quickly heal wounds, soothe emotions and even bless people and objects.If it wasn't for their difference in hair, the twins would have been identical. Rivor had long straight jet black hair and a lithe but powerful build. A mix of their parents, she had a creamy pale complexion with undertones of blue primarily across her cheekbones and around her ears and eyes. Her ears were long and pointed just like her father's and her almond shaped pupil less eyes were a deep shade of violet. She usually wore fine Eladrin made golden armor with teal accents, the colors of their house. Her hair was normally held back by an ornate golden circlet, except for a single braid that fell over her right shoulder.Celeb had soft curls that fell to his shoulders, shining silver like the light from the moon. As he got older for some reason, he took to shaving half of his head and leaving the other side a mess of thick curls. Like his sister, the signature pale blue of the Eladrin was present across his face. With his long pointed ears and deep pupil less violet eyes, if the twins had no hair they'd be almost impossible to tell apart. Celeb most often wore flowing teal robes held together with shimmering gold thread. It wasn't abnormal for noble born Eladrin to adorn themselves with jewelry of all types as Celeb usually wore a golden chain that hung from his right ear, the other side attached to his right nostril. The only thing Celeb was never without was the dull greyish black stone he wore as a pendant around his neck, given to him by his mother it was his last connection to her."9/19/2017 8:25:12, Carl Rae Jenkins,Human,Bard,"Carl is the son of a famous bard, Carly Rae Jenkins, an impeccable harp players who would travel the world with her son, staying from tavern to tavern, and spoiling the young boy with any clothes, toy and instrument he desired.

It’s like a reverse version of the movie “Brave.” Her mother “took” a Giant specifically so she would have “strong offspring.” Her mother is a real piece of work. She is a friend to all the animals and hides deep insecurity behind a wall of bravado. She does, however, continue to have the Barbarian problem of falling into a blood-rage when sufficiently pissed off."9/19/2017 10:21:29,Grok,Half-Orc,Thief,"Incredibly intimidating half-orc who thinks he’s a master thief. However, he’s really just so scary and strong that nobody bothers to argue with him. He does not pick locks, he punches the handles out of doors. He does not pickpocket, he rips people’s pants off and bolts. He does not break into vaults, he just BREAKS the vaults. Despite clearly being better suited to being a fighter of some kind, he insists he is the sneakiest, most agile thief in the world. The truth of it is, when he breaks into some place, he is very noisy and almost immediately spotted. When he is spotted, he shouts “YOU NO SEE GROK!!!”...People are usually inclined to agree that they do not, in fact, see Grok."9/19/2017 10:22:57,Francella Pallas (aka France),Gnome,Ranger,"This gnomish girl is not a swashbuckling adventurer or a charming rogue, but a deadly agent of vengeance.

Hamfat,Halfling,Rogue,A chef gathering regional recipes for a cookbook from the cultures and kingdoms he visits.9/19/2017 11:36:08,Lock on an Open Door,Tabaxi,Rogue,"A cat from humble beginnings; Lock on an Open Door (Lock to those who know him) hails from outside the forested town of Croy. Born to Key with no Teeth (Mother) and Open Door to a Safe (Father), Lock spent his childhood studying under his parents as a locksmith, while playing with the other Tabaxi children in their small tribe.Always a great storyteller, Key told many grand tales of her ancestors in Talvar. She told stories of a master locksmith in the family from many generations ago working closely with Talvari royalty. Cage with no Bars once was a servant to the King, but at some point proved himself and became the King’s personal locksmith. He designed intricate and beautiful locks and safes for the King’s vast riches. Some stories go that Cage’s fleeting fancies led him outside of Talvar; others that he outlived his usefulness and the King sent him away to find other work; while yet others insist that he was banished for trying to steal from the very safes he created.Whatever the case, Lock knew from a young age that Talvar was where he wanted to call home eventually. The fantastical stories that his mother would tell painted vivid pictures in the curious cat’s mind of unending mystery, unbound opportunity, rich stories to be heard, and limitless new knowledge. However, as it usually is, stories turned out to be far from reality.Shortly after arriving in Talvar around his 16th birthday, Lock found himself getting bored with urban life. Sure there was the fascinating technology, the fast talking merchants, and exuberant bards; but life it seemed, whether in the forests around Croy or in the busy streets of Talvar; was never as interesting as the greatest stories promised.That is, until Lock met a man name Tilbius Cortingham. Tilbius was a dashing man who told the most epic of tales. Endless stories poured fromTilbius to Lock over countless ales. Only the stories told by Tilbius were different than other stories. These stories had real, tangible ties to the City of Water and Storms. Every story came with a task; tasks that Lock could fixate on and then forget about with just as much ease. It started out small; a story of a beautiful gem freed from an underwater grave; a note written to an illicit lover by some political figure. Eventually though, the stories became more elaborate, tasks more complex. Tilbius would ask Lock to hunt down men and women who had perpetrated high profile crimes against the state. He would send him on clandestine missions to covertly apprehend political rivals of those in power. For Lock, this was the ultimate opportunity to learn the secrets of Talvar. It was the purest form of obsession. The thrill of the hunt, and then the wiping of paws from the situation; it was his true calling. Without even realizing it he had been inducted into The Relentless (or The Gold Hand), a guild working alongside the law whose prime objective is to bring to justice those most elusive of criminals and retrieve the things no one else can retrieve.It’s been several years now since Lock arrived in Talvar and since he has seen his family. After his most recent bounty he decided to take a trip back home to see his mother and father and tell his own stories this time around.Lock possesses a nearly insatiable obsession. Of what? Well, just about anything. It changes from bounty to bounty; story to story; hour to hour. Once Lock has fixated on something he pursue it with an undying fanaticism until he’s gotten what he wants, or something more interesting comes along. He has a compulsive curiosity that can sometimes get him into trouble, but he has been working diligently to curb his compulsions. Maybe it’s a side effect of the obsession, or maybe it’s some innate ideal; but Lock displays amazing devotion to those who are able to provide him with a steady stream new stories, new obsessions, or juicy secrets. The flip side of this, of course, is that an object of devotion can easily fall out of favor for new, more interesting people with new, more interesting information.Few doubt Lock’s ability. It is one of his few obsessions that never retreats. He is always pushing his own personal boundaries, whether physically, mentally, or socially in hopes of becoming a more perfect bounty hunter.Lock keeps a tight circle of trusted individuals. His parents, Key and Safe, never quite leave the back of his mind. Tilbius continues to be a great mentor to the Tabaxi hunter. These three individuals are among the few people for whom Lock would sacrifice himself with little thought.Aside from the odd acquaintance in Talvar, there is but one other person that holds a spot in Lock’s circle of interest. The half-elven daughter of a baker in Talvar’s market district, Taelyn Isdara first won Lock’s attention with her famous mince pies. However, her knack for baking was no match for her stories, and neither for her beauty. The two have been casual friends, sharing stories and cuisine on a consistent basis, but Lock’s obsession may be turning into a romantic interest, something he is far from familiar with. Something he’s not all too comfortable with. Not to mention, Taelyn’s father has strong prejudice against anyone who isn’t pink of skin and pointy of ears."9/19/2017 11:36:56,Solindar Sindel,Half-Elf,Cleric,"Solindar, a young half-elf from the settlement of Jaarstead, grew up the bastard son of a logger named Kaarl Sindel. His mother, Aeria, an elvish whore from Solindra, was never in the picture. Upon learning of the pregnancy, she immediately made arrangements for Kaarl to take custody of the child as is customary in that region of the realm.Kaarl was always tough on the boy. Solindar’s elven blood sullied his image in his father’s eyes, not to mention his lacking desire to carry on the Sindel-family tradition of logging. No, Solindar was always the odd duck in the Sindel household. His two brothers, Kaaden and Jeral, always took their father’s favor.It reached a point, somewhere around the age of 14, where Solindar was denied sustenance unless he took up logging. He was more interested in divinity, and frankly, the thought of chopping down trees sickened him – surely a trait of his elven heritage. In order to survive, Solindar took to the streets performing small cons to earn enough coin to buy his own food.As it turned out, Solindar was particularly good at conning people. His strong charisma and deep knowledge of religion resonated with just about anyone, allowing him to make a decent living as a faith healer, albeit a phony one. To his surprise, some of his marks were indeed healed, found good fortune, or were just so taken with him that when his services didn’t work they just shrugged it off.This ruse went on for several years until the summer of his 17th birthday, when he conned the wrong man. A travelling merchant came to Solindar to be cured of a particularly severe necrotic blight. Solindar performed a convincing ritual, painting the man’s afflicted areas with a flesh-colored ointment and advising him the blight would surely subside in a couple days’ time. The merchant left town after paying Solindar a handsome fee.Several days later the merchant returned, furious that the blight was not only not cured, but was spreading faster than before. The merchant, Ygnolio Frustram was connected to a local crime syndicate known as The Brotherhood of Black Ties. When he returned to Jaarstead he brought with him a gang of Black Ties Enforcers to punish the charlatan.By the time Ygnolio and the Black Ties left Jaarstead, Kaarl, Kaaden, and Jeral had all been slaughtered. Solindar was left alive if not severely crippled. His left knee had been crushed by a mace, which would leave him with a lifelong limp. Ygnolio also burned the Mark of Black Ties onto his back, ensuring that he would forever owe his life to the Brotherhood. "9/19/2017 11:39:16,TALI,tiefling,bard,"TALI was raised in a big city by a woman who found her in a basket, not knowing anything about her or where she came from. she was named after the initials T.A.L.I. on a music box she was left with, but other than that no clues were left to her past.

Together they were able to broker a peace treaty between the orc fighters and the town, and her mother inevitably married her father and joined him in his faith. Ch'harth is the most enthusiastic of the town's newest crop of clerics, and she regularly ventures into the wilderness and the Underdark, brokers unlikely alliances, and stubbornly upholds her vow to shine the light of Pelor everywhere she goes."9/19/2017 11:48:02,Vaana,human,ranger,"Vaana grew up with loving parents who were the guards of a merchant family, sea-faring traders in an archipelago-like region. She was used to being carefree & this was encouraged by her parents, who were similar. When she struck out on her own, she found an adventuring party and wrote back to her parents frequently. After a few years, she heard from her parents that they were giving up their sea-faring lifestyle and moving inland, which struck her as odd. She cut ties with her adventuring party (involving angst, since none of them cared enough to return with her, despite the fact they'd been friends for years) and went to check on her parents, to find that they were all right, but getting a bit too old for that lifestyle. She devoted herself to caring for them as they aged, and helped as much as she could, but still lost them when she was around 40 years old. She decided to stay in their house (basically in the middle of nowhere in the woods) and withdraw from interacting with others, coming to terms with her parents' deaths. She continued to hone her talents as a ranger, hunting and foraging for food and survival. She eventually befriended a fishing cat who became her familiar - named Blue, after her preference for bluefin tuna in the river near their prowling grounds. She was brought out of retirement and met her current party (at the start of this campaign) through a contract that the dean of a somewhat-nearby university specifically requested her for, to kill a lich that had been terrorizing the area. Vaana, having a strong preference for the natural order of things over necromantic leanings, felt a calling to join up and fight, and brought Blue with her. TL;DR: badass, antisocial, grumpy old lady and her wild cat friend have a good time killing a lich with fellow partymembers, a dying elf and a robot."9/19/2017 11:48:48,Pebble-Rolls-Down-The-Mountain,Kenku,Monk,"Mud-Splash was a street thug living in the alleys and sewers of a large city.

After two cold nights alone in the wilds, starving and frightened, he came across a remote monastery and went in to thieve some food. The monks there took pity on him, wretched as he was, and put him to work earning his keep. A patient and wise teacher took him under his wing, and taught him discipline, meditation and kindness.After years of instruction, Mud-Splash decided that he would go out into the world and become an advocate and fighter for the downtrodden and abandoned.

They took this out on Brikaria, who was too heartbroken to do anything but accept their wrath.

She faded fast, but the last thing she did before she died was to petition the Duke for an audience. Her friendship with the Duke’s elven MasterHarper probably helped. Siegfried was too young to realise what was being discussed and was more interested in Baby Leopold, squalling in the arms of his mother, the Duchess. He sang to little Leo, the same lullaby his mother sang to him, and the babe settled, much to the Duchess’s surprise and relief.Shortly after, his mother passed away and the MasterHarper came to collect him and his things to move into Appin Castle. It was a strange upbringing. The Duke treated him as his own son, making no secret to him that that was indeed who he was. The Duchess, however, made sure he realised he was a bastard and that the dukedom would be Leo’s. Only the loyal retainers were included in the secret. Whenever company came, Siegfried was seated at the far end of the hall, with the musicians and militia. Siegfried didn’t mind at all. He was allowed to learn all the musical instruments and performance the Harper would teach him, self-defense and horsemanship from the Hand of the Duke, politics and presence from the Duke himself. Leo taught him how to be noble and, in return, Siegfried taught him how to have fun - also much to the disgust of the Duchess. One day, he would be Leo's MasterHarper, singing him songs and watching out for his little brother.Then the Duke died. A tragic hunting accident. Before he was cold in the ground, the Duchess had taken Siegfried to one side to tell him he was no longer welcome at Appin. He had until nightfall to remove himself and his belongings, not even enough time to speak to Leo, who was still at the memorial service with the Harper. It was tempting to disobey her - pretend to go but hide either in the nearby village or even the bowels of the Castle itself. It had tunnels aplenty and he and Leo had explored most of them, but she had sent guards to “help” him with his things and when one of them offered to carry his lute, giving them the slip came with a price he wasn’t prepared to pay.It wouldn’t matter - he would survive, learn, develop his skills. He could come back to Appin and be an even better Harper to Leo than he would have been had he stayed. Yes, that was what he would do."9/19/2017 12:41:04,Pandora Tealeaf,Halfling,Rogue,"Pandora Tealeaf is the eldest of three children, left orphaned by (insert campaign-related situation on monster of choice here). In order to support the only other survivor, her little brother (Pippin, nicknamed Squeak, short for Pipsqueak -now being cared for by their aunt), she apprenticed to her disreputable uncle (a burglar).She has since qualified and struck out on her own, sending anything over her running costs back for her brother's upkeep. If she doesn't make enough, he’ll be pressured to join uncle’s gang. Pandora knows Pip’s clever enough, he could be so much more.

It took him a split second, and thefeeling that that he’d made a huge mistake accompanied by the sudden drop for him to realise theremains of the pathway he’d been trying to follow had dropped out and now, so had he.It was some minutes later that he recovered consciousness, bruised, bloody and broken. The top of thecrevice was almost out of sight so far above him. Dragging a recalcitrant animal all the way back upthere in his current state would be far from easy. He swore, loud, long and blasphemously, castingextreme doubt on the legitimacy of Pelor and many of His ancestors.Grumpily, he pulled himself up, making a quick assessment of the worst of his injuries and applying basicfirst aid as best he could. Drawing himself to he feet, wincing at the pain, he spotted the sheep nearby. Itblinked at him, innocently, its coat gleaming in the dimness.“I didn’t come this far to give up on you now, you bastard!” he growled and flung himself at it.To his surprise, what should have been handfuls of soft, warm wool wasn’t there at all... in its place aman stood, shining in the dark. Blinking, Torak let go of the man’s cloak and staggered back in surprise.“I have need of a man of your determination, Torak Ironfist. I have a flock of my own in need of tendingand occasional rescue. Will you work for me?”Torak felt a strange sensation of calm flow over him and for a moment, it was only the two of them - nocrevice, no rocks, no pain.“They do wander off so and the more of us there are to keep an eye on them, the better, don’t youthink?”“Are... are you...?”“Yes.”Torak dropped to his knees, “Oh, my Lord, I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to say those things, well, I mean Idid obviously, but not like that. I...”“Hush now. You think I don’t know you well enough to understand the difference?” the man reached out a glowing hand to Torak, gesturing for him to take the assistance to rise to his feet. “What you say about me is of no import, what work you do for me is. Now, rise again Shepherd, like the sun also rises. There is much work to be done.”"9/19/2017 12:44:19,Caldan,Human,Monk,Caldan was abandoned on the steps of a Monastery dedicated to St Cuthbert as a baby. He was raised as a temple orphan learning alongside those sent to the monastery to study and eventually on his fourteenth birthday joining the monastery as an initiate. He excelled at the physical side of his training to be a monk demonstrating exceptional speed and agility but struggled with the more contemplative side. Over the course of his training he got to know a dwarves cleric of St Cuthbert who regularly visited the monastery. Over time the cleric Steve helped Caldan to understand the spiritual side of his calling and the friendship that developed between the two meant that when the Abbot decided that Caldan was ready to leave the monastery he was sent out into the world with Steve to assist him in setting up a new temple.9/19/2017 12:49:42,Xibalba,Tabaxi,Rogue,"I am the daughter of Cuetlacotl (kwet-la-cot-l)and the Tabaxi jaguar lord Tonauac (tawn-oh-awk) of the Broken Shore clan of Meztica. As is the case with all jaguar lords, Tonauac's father was one, and his father before him, and so on, until the beginning of time. Jaguar lords can only produce male jaguar lord offspring. My brother Ehecatl, therefore, is also a jaguar lord. And I, consequently, cannot be the blood relation of the ones I call my family.I believe my mother is my true mother, but I cannot be the child of Tonauac. It is biologically impossible. I have grown to believe that Tonauac killed my true father -- my mother was the most beautiful of our clan and it is likely that Tonauac got rid of him in order to be able to mate with her. It is also likely that my mother helped him, as her relatives were not terribly powerful or well-respected and she was always interested in improving her lot in the world. I discovered this fact about my genetics a number of years ago, when I was quite young. It never disturbed me greatly, but I certainly feel very little allegiance to Tonauac (and, really, my mother and brother) because of it -- a feeling which he has detected and punished me for in his cruel way, typical for a jaguar lord. Tonauac's takeover of our clan has spawned more violent and war-mongering attitudes toward other Tabaxi and other races, particularly in the more youthful members. As humans have begun to encroach upon our clan, and many other Tabaxi clans, there is growing concern that we will lose our space forever. And nobody seems to have much interest in doing anything about this, aside from killing the humans that stray into our territory (Tonauac's approach, of course, which I have told him will only work for so long as the humans breed like rats and will overrun us quickly). I, however, have heard whisperings -- just the barest hint of myth or lore, really -- of a relic that, combined with the appropriate spell or incantation, could hide our entire island from the whole world. And so, I've left to look for it. In my wanderings about Meztica I came upon a jaguar lord, about my age, named Xezcel (chez-kel) -- who, at the moment, has no clan but does have a fierce desire to acquire one. Consequently, I've come up with a plan: Xezcel and I will find the Hiding Relic and bring it back to Meztica, whereupon we will kill Tonauac, take over the clan, and hide the island forever. Xezcel is intensely excited about all of this. (So is Tonauac, though of course he shouldn't be. I told him what I am seeking before I left our island, and he believes I am seeking it on his behalf, to atone for my unruly behavior or some such nonsense.) I have grown to like Xezcel, but his relevance to my goal may diminish eventually depending on what other weapons and relics I can acquire throughout our travels, at which point I will have no qualms about abandoning him. Xezcel and I have thus far searched most of Meztica with little success -- I harbored no illusions that the relic would be so close to home, but felt it necessary to be methodical about it anyway. So we have headed for colder climes, and will reach Knarvell within a fortnight. "9/19/2017 12:50:12,Irethaea,Eladrin,Psion,"I grew up in wealthy household, in the large cosmopolitan city of Ferm-Ner-Fa. My father is a well-known politician, and well-liked by the upper classes, but very two-faced/duplicitous. I saw his behavior from both sides and find it unappealing and manipulative, but makes him irritatingly successful. He is not loving or kind to me and my brother Carric, but bought us everything he thought we desired as children and kept us shut in the house out of a (not unfounded) fear that we (I) would blab about his lies and deceit. Both my brother and I are quite intelligent, but my brother turned out a spoiled brat prone to vices, and I turned out awkward and without much in the way of social skills or worldly knowledge. We were educated at home by a continually rotating cast of tutors who were run off by either my brother's foul behavior or my constant harassment about the political or monetary favors they received from my father in exchange for putting up with us. Our mother was wonderful but fell ill and died when we were quite young -- I always held a (relatively unfounded) suspicion that my father slowly poisoned her because she disliked his progressively deeper involvement in the seedy underbelly of the politics of the city. As I grew older, I took my education into my own hands and would frequently sneak out of the house to either go to the library or observe (always observe, never join) parties and gatherings at the homes of the political elite. I also became very good at lockpicking and would unlock drawers in my father's desk to read his correspondence and other papers, further cementing my hatred of the way he worked. My brother neglected his studies and instead became embroiled in gambling and darker habits, which I was fully aware of, though my father had no idea. I had little interest in attempting to correct my brother's course in life, as he had never been particularly kind to me and seemed to me to be simply an unrefined reflection of my father's soul. My brother would frequently use our father's high standing and his own status as the favorite child to make wild promises to his so-called ""friends"", most of which he was somehow able to pull off. He spiraled deeper and deeper into these very unsavory social circles, and I waited for the day when he would get into serious trouble and be put in jail, or at the very least banished from the house. As a young adult, my father permitted me to pursue more traditional studies outside the home after years of badgering from me, and gave me a sort of apprenticeship with one of his more gentle colleagues, an elven woman named Fi Heleberos (fee hell-eh-BER-os). Fi was the sort of person who got involved in politics with the true intention of making things better, and had retained most of this positive spirit but had become fairly disillusioned with the world in general, an outlook I shared. Had my father known the kind of person Fi really was, he never would have placed me with her, but his blindness caused him to perceive her as a weak, powerless fraud of a politician and gave me the good fortune of experiencing actual kindness -- kindness without expectations -- and my first real friend. Fi became a sort of aunt figure to me, and guided me through the perils of young adulthood and taught me some semblance of social skills (though due to my father's place in society, most of my social interactions were tainted either by people asking me for favors or being afraid of me -- since I'd essentially been locked up and/or socially inept for all my life, no one knew anything about me and assumed I was very much my father's daughter and willing to play those political games). A couple of years into my apprenticeship with her, however, Fi made a political move that threw her into the spotlight for the first time in her career, and this was not well-received by my father and his ilk. They made her life hell -- she was gaslighted and harassed to the point that she left the city, and I never heard from her again. Fi was interested in justice and fairness to a fault, and though I learned much of this attitude from her it has translated within me to a somewhat more harsh philosophy that everything ought to be for the good of the greatest number, and that no one is above that. Essentially, my home life was an elaborate game in which no one trusted anyone else and happiness was non-existent. I never wanted for anything material, as my father continued to believe that a steady supply of pretty dresses and nice things would keep me in check, and as a result I never quite learned how normal people have to function in the world and based my understanding of these quotidian interactions on the way I saw people behave from afar in shops and public squares. But I never had a friend aside from Fi, and I learned early on that the things you care about will be taken from you, so it's generally best to not care about anything at all. Because I had such a lonely childhood, I will jump at the opportunity to call someone a friend, but am equally quick to feel betrayed or offended at any slight, as I am convinced (and not wrongly) that everyone wants something from me, or will leave me behind. I was never quite brave enough to stand up to my father, and I never felt like I had any particular thing to stand up to him for. I saw the games he and his cronies played with the lives and livelihoods of the populace, and became convinced that this was the way most people were, and that there was nothing I could do to change my father or the world around me. I was never abused or neglected in a way I felt was worthy of being upset about -- I was clothed and fed, and had nicer things than most people in our city, so I didn't feel I could complain. But when my brother disappeared and didn't return after several days as he usually did, my father sent me to go find him (my father being under the impression that my brother and I were close, or that we at least spoke to each other, neither of which was true) and I took this as the opportunity to make a simple and harmless escape from a life that seemed like prison. So I made my way to Daedalus's Grove (where my brother was last seen) to keep up appearances that I was actually going to look for him, because I knew my father had eyes and ears in the area. But I was entirely directionless -- no plans or desires aside from leaving home -- so once I fell in with the Guardians and discovered how interesting the world can be and how nice it is to have company, if not friends, I lost what little intention I had of looking for my brother at all. Once we left Daedalus's Grove, I had little concern about my father tracking me down, as his reach only extends so far. And based on the peril my brother was clearly in the last time I think I saw him in that cave, I'm not sure I'll be hearing from him anytime soon. I feel it is my duty to counteract the evil that my father and brother have put into this world, and to be frank, leaving my brother in whosever grasp he's in is for the greater good. So for now, I'm enjoying running about doing noble deeds -- in fact, I think I'm maybe even having fun.

Once he came of age, he set out as an adventuring scholar to restore the fortunes of his family."9/19/2017 12:58:16,Pativzar Duke of Caroling,Silver Dragonborn,Bard,"Grew up in Millil's Ear, a coastal city  founded by the god Milil and home to the top Bards College as well as the base for the Church of Milil.As a child, Pativzar grew up loving music and Milil. He always wanted to be chosen as one of Milil's champions, weather it be as a paladin or a cleric, he didn't care. He knew this dream was unlikely because Milil only ever made humans and Elves his champions. Even so, he spent his childhood trying to prove himself to Milil through prayer and song. Though he realized Milil would probably never choose him as one of his champions, Pativzar was still dedicated to him. One way he thought that he could gain the favor of Milil was by becoming the Mayor of Milil's Ear, a position held by Adventurer's who were thought to stand for the Ideals of Milil. The clergy of The Church of Milil were very supportive of Pativzar as he grew up. Jace Verilice, one of the High Priest's,  was always particularly kind to him. He acted as Pativzar's mentor in the church as well as the reason he was aloud into the Bard's College. Though he was a hard studier, there were many teachers who thought that he shouldn't be in the Bard's college, because he lacked any raw talent, which they believed to be essential to becoming a Bard and would be better off becoming a  Wizard with the way he studied. However, Because of all the time and effort Pativzar put into his studies, he was able to rise to the top of the class by the time he graduated. Second in the class actually. The top of the class was actually a different Silver Dragonborn named Ace. He, unlike Pativzar, was born with exceptionally raw talent. He was good at everything he did, from sparing, to magic, to music, he was a natural. Not only did he outperform Pativzar in everything, he was also far more liked by the rest of the school.Pativzar was awed by Ace at first and saw him as someone to emulate. Being the only Dragonborn, his teachers would often pair them together regardless of the task. This close relationship made Pativzar realize just how much harder he needed to work to become worthy of ever being one of Milil's champions. Their close relationship also soured his view of Ace. He came to realize that Ace wasn't the perfect person he portrays himself to be, but a naturaly gifted coward who cracks when the going gets tough. Pativzar first noticed this once when he got the upper hand in a spar and a hint of fear in Ace's eyes who backed off for a second. Though others saw it as being cunning, Pativzar knew Ace was backing off out of fear, not out of planning. Though Pativzar considered this a minor victory, Ace ultimately won the duel in the end.After that, Pativzar was able to see this weakness in different ways when observing Ace, his adoration for Ace soured from a friendly rivalry into a bitter one where instead of striving to be like Ace, Pativzar strove to be better than Ace in every way. Though his feelings soured, he has stayed outwardly friendly to AceThough Pativzar never beat Ace while at the Bard College, the rivalry and constant comparison to him drove Pativzar to better himself in every way possible which lead to him finishing 2nd in the class but with a far smaller gap in their abilities, even if Ace doesn't realize just how close they are now. Having graduated, Pativzar is ready to head out on his first adventure. Only time will tell what that will bring."9/19/2017 13:18:19,Kaff,Human,Wizard,"Kaff was left at an orphanage at a young age after his parents died in a magic accident.

Most of these are of no value except to the clan - a tooth, a few scales, a bone, a claw.  The Greatmother, however, was a powerful sorceress, and she possessed a heavy gold torc known as the Collar of Akkra.  The clan used the collar with the appropriate ritual to briefly grant the leader extraordinary divination powers in times of uncertainty or division.  A ruffian named Rook, a blond human with a missing left ear, joined the clan's caravan for protection crossing the desert.  When they were within a day's travel of the coastal city of the Iris, he poisoned two of Hanni's cousins and stole the Collar, and Hanni was chosen to track down the thief.She trailed him to the Iris and lost the trail in the myriad dusty marketplaces of the lower city.  After a week of fruitless searching, she discovered that he had boarded a ship bound for Vornheim.  She followed, scraping together money for her search with busking and odd jobs.  By the time she reached Vornheim, Rook was long gone and Hanni started looking for ways to make some quick money to hire a witch to scry him out.

After his coming of age initiation, he chose to work towards becoming part of the Chieftains bodyguards. To everyone’s surprise, he passed the initiation and became the newest hopeful recruit for the Skywardens.Still too young and inexperienced to have quested for his own Pegasus, his daily tasks involved guarding the Chieftains wife, infant son and daughter, Morwenna. This was when he first fell in love. Morwenna and he were the same age, and they both had a love of animals, Skeld just needed to impress her and her father enough to allow them to wed. A journey to the One Stone in the Moonwood, could be the perfect way to show off his skills, so he arranged to be part of the escort for the Shaman Blackhoof, his son Gunnleif, Morwenna and her mother.Little did he know that the Lycanthrope tribe of Claw Hollow had moved into the area, and had paid Blackhoof to bring the Chiefs family for sacrifice to them, rather than going to the One Stone for blessings. The ambush was fast, Skeld managed to get Morwenna, her mother, Hildegard and Gunnleif galloping through a gap during the fight. The chase was intense, with three powerful Lycanthropes in hot pursuit, Hildergart and Morwenna’s long limbed warhorses were having no problem, but being the youngest Skeld only had a tough Uthgardt pony to ride and started to fall behind.He never saw the Werewolf that took him from his horse, his shield and pony took most of the blow, turning into kindling and meat respectively. He hit one of the many standing stones, fortune smiling on him as he slid into a hollow near its base, and the pony fell across the opening. There he lay for many hours, unconscious and bleeding. When he finally awoke and woozily pushed his way out, it was night. Following the trail that Morwenna, Hildergart and the other Warden’s horses had left, he came upon a grizzly scene, two of the horses were dead next to claw marks and a large puddle of blood surrounding what looked like human guts. Of the two woman and the Skywarden, there was no other trace.Only Morwennas black Uthgardt warhorse remained unharmed, caught in some briars a short distance away. Skeld managed to disentangle the horse and haul himself into the saddle before blacking out once more.It was many days later when he awoke once more, in a tree hut owned by a Wood elf ranger. The ranger introduced themselves as Taurandir, he had witnessed the battle, and the small groups flight from the Lycans. He had also seen what had happened after Skeld had been knocked off his horse. It was grim news. The Lycans had cornered Hildegard, Morwenna and Gunnleif, killing the two horses and nearly eviscerating Gunnleif. But then Bloodhoof had arrived, an argument had ensued and they had been led away into the forest. Taurandir had wanted to be sure Skeld would not turn before he offered aid, he had been impressed at the Uthgardt's tenacity in spite of his injury. That was when Skeld realised his head was shaved and bandaged, stitches and herbalism had saved his life, but it had not left him unmarked. He wanted to pursue the Claw Hollow Lycans immediately, hoping to rescue Morwenna and her mother, Taurandir managed to persuade him to stay and recover before marching to certain death. Another three days passed, Skeld regained his strength and formed a plan. He would return to the village, gather the Skywardens and the Chief, lead them to the forest and Taurandir would help track the Lycans. However; upon returning to the village his world collapsed around him. Bloodhoof saw him before he could enter the great hall, screaming accusations he rushed forward, demanding the Skeld's arrest. The guards nearby leapt to obey, hauling the surprised youth into the Great Hall before the chief, but it was not Chief Alfhelm sat on the Great seat, but Chief Gunnleif!Horrified Skeld stood open mouthed as Gunnleif and Bloodhoof recounted a heavily altered version of the events, accusing Skeld of organising the ambush with the Claw Hollow Lycanthropes. In a daze, he was led away to the stockade. That night Taurandir broke him out, the elf had seen them leading him away in chains and assumed the worst. Enflamed with thoughts of vengeance Skeld vowed to return one day to clear his name, rescue Morwenna and kill his accusers. "9/19/2017 14:19:09,Afua Allmhurán DaAxis,Deva,Bard,"Afua works for the royal constabulatory as an investigator, and has done so for at least 45 years.

Most Devas can recover memories goin back centuries, but Afua cannot.  He believes that he has simply died so many times that the 485 years prior to his oldest memory has been completely lost to this memory attrition.  But he worries that he chose to forget.  His memory is so lost that he doesn't know his original name, or where he is from.  But, this unique circumstance means he views his personhood as unrelated to memories: it is more important to ""be himself"" than it is to remember details that are probably wrong anyways.  As such, each time he dies and returns he takes a new name.  He last died and returned on Axis Island, and so named himself ""Afua Allmhurán DaAxis"": meaning Born on a Friday, A Stranger from Across the Sea, Of Axis.

The cult believes the tieflings’ “curse” can be eradicated through centuries of devotion down the bloodlines and intermarrying with humans. For some in the cult, this devotion takes the form of monastic combat training and harnessing of one’s ki. They were never a perfect student, but developed their skills well within the context of the cult. For most tieflings in the cult, including Alacrity and their sister Penitence, devotion also means marrying and having a child with a human. The pressure is even greater for them, because by the reckoning of the cult, their bloodline should be purified enough that any children either of them have with a human should be a human rather than a tiefling. When Alacrity is 22, Penitence gives birth to her first child. When the infant is discovered to be a tiefling, Penitence is killed, in accordance with the cult’s rules (her husband is imprisoned and the child disappears). Alacrity, furious and terrified, flees the cult at once. With no experience of life outside the cult, Alacrity struggles to find a place for themself in the major city in which they wash up. To make matters worse, in the wake of their shattered faith, they’ve lost control of their ki abilities. After bumming around for a while, a lost and rain-soaked Alacrity meets Corbett, a half-elf. Corbett takes them home and gives them a place to stay. Alacrity is icy at first, being a negative person by nature, and not liking the vulnerable position they’re in. Corbett is a perfect gentleman, never for a moment expressing sexual interest in his new roommate. With time, things change. Corbett works with the underserved people of the city, doing whatever needs doing and advocating for folks who find themselves in legal trouble. He also knows a little bit of healing magic, and can help people with minor injuries and illnesses. Alacrity soon joins him on these visits, helping where they can, and slowly finding their footing in the outside world. Slowly, too, Alacrity and Corbett fall in love. They have years together. They live a meager, marginalized life in the big city, but they’re happy with each other. Mostly, that is. A wedge that was there from the start eventually drives between them: Alacrity’s past. Alacrity can’t bear to speak to Corbett about the cult, and about the trauma they suffered throughout their youth, and on that final day when Penitence died. The secrets stop Alacrity from being as open and vulnerable as love requires, and silences turn to snaps turn to arguments with no resolution. One day, Alacrity leaves. They move to a different part of the city, just as impoverished, and spend weeks in misery and intoxicants. They surface from the bender one morning to a bright flash of light, and a heavy voice begins speaking to them. The voice belongs to Emizah, the goddess worshipped by the cult Alacrity grew up in. Only, Emizah says, they don’t truly worship her at all. Emizah has no strictures about purity that can “cleanse” tieflings. In fact, the nature of the cult is abhorrent to her. She values all life above any other concern, whether human or tiefling or anything else. That the cult has been killing people in her name is a blasphemy of the highest order. Unfortunately, she has lost her ability to act directly on the material plane, and can’t personally do anything to stop them. Instead, she recruits people to her cause, and to devotion to her. In return, she gives them divine power. Alacrity is immediately resistant, telling her to fuck right off. What do they owe her? They don’t want anything except some peace and quiet to succumb to their depression in. But Emizah knows what Alacrity went through, and she knows how deeply their hatred for the cult runs. She entices them with one last request: in exchange for divine magic, Alacrity will personally take down the people that killed their sister. Alacrity agrees. For years, they take up the mantle of a wandering healer, though they keep the source of their power obscure. Alacrity has no desire to be seen as associated with the cult, the only people who worship Emizah openly, and so dodges questions that get too close to the secret. All the while, Emizah occasionally directs them to perform tasks that, she swears, will bring Alacrity closer to their revenge. Eventually, at the age of 30, they are recruited to act as medic on an inter-planar ship."9/19/2017 14:31:24,Miri Greycastle,Human,Wizard,"A bookish woman from a noble family in Cormyr, Miri was always too smart for her own good.

But she is also the eldest of seven, very much your overbearing older sibling, and constantly, annoyingly, right.  She joined the local militia to get out of the farming community where her family lives, and where she had been more or less parenting her younger brothers.  Rowan had always been gifted horsewoman, and turned out to be equally gifted in the cavalry.  She loved it, and would have stayed, save the fact she didn't make friends so well.  Turns out, being predisposed to bossiness, being a little too over prepared, and having the literal terrain on her side, with a helping of supernatural strength and sight, didn't make her popular.  Reliable in battle, and possessed of the spine to do the right thing in difficult circumstances, she was very good at her job, however, when she tried to buy commission into the regular, standing army, she was summarily denied, and sent back home.  Rowan decided she was having none of that.  She packed up her gear and started for the nearest major city, to talk with higher placed officers directly.  They still weren't having it, so she sold her horse, and booked passage to another continent.  On the ship, she had the very ill-luck to fall in with a group of, let's say...vagrants, who have put her on the outs with the law.  On the one hand, she's currently got a bounty on her head for one that no good Steven killing a guard she was standing next to, on the other, these idiots literally couldn't keep themselves alive if she wasn't bringing her shield up in their defense and she can't have their deaths on her conscience.  And they're not all bad, Maplefist is a nice enough sort.  Even if he is like a...7 foot tall toddler lumberjack in a loincloth.  So, basically, she's right back playing put-upon older sister to a bunch of miscreants, but it has meant she's sleeping under the stars, and has become much more at peace with her own, natural affinity for green places and animals.  And it doesn't hurt that she can now literally call down thunder from the sky, that's pretty fun, she won't lie.  Rowan is a little stodgy, and tends to overthink things, but means well, and feels responsible for those around her.

The nights of her early life were filled with starry skies from horizon to horizon, and days full herding and learning from the priestess of her tribe. Her easy nature and natural curiosity made her eager to learn the ways of their goddess, Mishakal, and, as she bloomed from youth into maidenhood, she begged her family allow her to leave the tribe to seek the Holy Order of the Stars for further instruction in the path of restoration and light.    The stories of Goldmoon and Riverwind fueled her fantasies of a romance and adventure she could only dream of experiencing. Naturally optimistic, and full of the desire for a life beyond the flock, she joined the Holy Order, spending her first three years working hard to attain the peace and discipline needed to heal the body of another while learning languages and lore.     It did not come easily. Boisterous, and too often unable to keep her mind from wandering in fanciful directions, she struggled with a wanderlust borne of a nomadic past. She craved the knowledge offered by the Order, but fought the need to roam, the need for freedom under diamond studded skies. After attaining the restraint and control needed to perform a couple spells of minor healing, a fellow acolyte and sometime object of unrequited affection, Errai, invited her to sneak away into the night. She followed him with little cajoling into the wilds surrounding the compound. Her heart bursting with an innocent love, and the desire for freedom always burning in the back of her consciousness, they stole away for a few glorious hours, returning just before the new day broke.    A single carefree night quickly became a reckless addiction. The few times they were discovered, they were forgiven, but cautioned strongly against such foolhardiness. The surrounding forests were dangerous, full of thieves and evil creatures.    Her love for Errai grew stronger with every evening spent away from the cloisters of the Holy Order, blossoming from sweet infatuation, to pure devotion. Errai, however seemed never to see her as more than a dear friend and confidant. A few years ahead in his own training, he had not much longer before his time was complete and he would strike out on his own. His heart seemed not to belong within the walls and safety of the place, and one night, during one of their unsanctioned excursions, Errai informed Zavijava he would be leaving for Waterdeep on the following morning. He had received a missive from his brother earlier that day, seeking aid in an endeavor at sea. He would return sometime… if he did not find his fortune and the life he craved on the open waters.    Overcome with loss and unsure how to behave in the face of losing the man who was so important to her, Zeevee simply kissed Errai tenderly upon the cheek, praying the benevolent Light Bringer smiled upon him, and together they watched the sky in silence until the first rays of morning crested the treetops.     The next morning, he was gone. She fled the stifling good will of those who would offer her condolences, those who were not him no matter how they smiled and bid her look to brighter days, as the emptiness burned in her breast like poison, leeching the light from the once-beloved stars, and making the perfectly full moon seem a pale imitation of heavenly perfection.    She shuffled down the paths, so often run hand-in-hand, alone, unseeing and uncaring whither they led. She heeded not the scents of blood, saw none of the broken branches, and heard none of the sounds of distress in the wood. She was alone.    When the growls of the unseen beast finally registered in her mind, only a second passed before she felt the flesh at the base of her neck giving way beneath strong jaws. The animal retreated before it had done enough damage to do more than make her scream in pain and spin to face her attacker. Weaponless and alone, she trembled as she looked upon it.    The animal was vaguely humanoid in shape, but grotesque, with haunting yellow eyes surrounded by demonic black sclera, and a maw filled with bloodstained teeth. A moment of giddy realization told her that was her blood. Fur covered its body in wiry grey tufts, and it sniffed the air as if testing the air to suss out her next move. It was on her again before she could blink. She was sure it spelled her death, but the creature merely seized her by the neck in one clawed hand and slammed her head into the tree she’d backed against, where the world around her went black.    When she regained consciousness, she believed herself dead. A few foundering moments of sorting through the pain radiating from the junction between her neck and shoulder dispelled the notion as the dead surely couldn’t feel pain, but she was sure she was blind, so deep was the inky darkness. Cold stone and dirt beneath her fingers brought reality closer into focus, and the truth of her plight followed on its heels.     Determination to survive roared to life within her.    Feeling along the ground, she found a pile of furs, and a dead… something… a rabbit, and a little farther in, a wooden pail half full of odorless liquid. She gulped it down greedily, her soiled hand tainting the flavor with grit and the harsh, metallic taste of blood. Her left shoulder throbbed mercilessly, but she dragged herself along the floor as she tried to feel her way out of the disorienting blackness.    Her captor returned before she even caught a hint of light that might give her hope of escape, however, and dragged her back to the place where the furs were piled. She screamed, begged him for mercy. Promised rewards she could never hope to deliver if he’d only let her go. He gave her no reply to any of her entreaties, only shoved the rabbit at her before leaving again, his fading footsteps the only indicator he was no longer there. Upon his next return, he found her trying to crawl away from the darkness once again. Once again, he unceremoniously deposited her back on the musty furs, before taking hold of her hair and yanking her head to the side and settling behind her. She cried out in pain and frustration at the rough handling, tears sliding down her cheeks in salty rivers. Still he refused to speak.    Instead, he tore her tunic from the crusted wound. She screamed again in pain and mortification as she felt a wide tongue begin to lave at the just-scabbing punctures. Trying futilely to break away, she wept, called for his mercy and that of her goddess, but none came. When he finished the inexplicable behavior, he stood, tossed the now stiff rabbit into her lap once again, and left her alone. She heaved the dead thing away from herself, not hearing it hit any walls, and wept herself into exhaustion.     Time was measured in attempts at flight and her subsequent return to her cell with no bars, the return of her captor, and dead things thrust upon her. She ate them raw, hunger eventually winning the internal war with revulsion. Her injury healed, her spirit did not. How often had she begged her Goddess for absolution, and none came? How had she failed? Why was she being punished? What new horror awaited her just beyond this? How would she ever escape?     Her captor seemed to know when she attempted to flee. He would let her try, but no matter what she tried, running, crawling, sliding along walls, he always brought her back before she ever saw the light of day. He had licked her wound several times before it had healed as well, but never spoke to her, never did more than bring her freshly killed animals that she was forced to rip into, fur and all, with her nails and teeth.    And then one day, he did not come.    He did not bring her an animal that she had to choke through fur and sinew and warm blood.    A day came when she met no one barring her departure from the cold confines of the cave’s blackness.    A day, or night rather, came when moonlight greeted her, promising salvation.    She stepped into it, not fully trusting that she would not be collected any moment and, perhaps, this time punished for daring to allow the moonlight to bather her gaunt features. It was harsh and bright to her ill-adjusted eyes, and she shrank back into the shadows before gathering her courage to run until she no longer possessed the strength.     Stepping fully into the forest, her heart threatened to beat through its cage.     A howl went up to her left as the clouds shrouding the full moon parted.    Zavijava took one last look at it before running, but pain sent ther crashing to the forest floor. Her bones felt like they were snapping all at once. While hot fire consumed every nerve ending. A guttural snarl ripped from her throat when she tried to scream.    And she knew.    The moonlight had not delivered her into salvation, no. It had borne her into hell.    Too late to return to her life…    Too late for a cure. "9/19/2017 17:37:45,Raxicoricofalipatorius Kalacpelgassacresalvoc,Ratman,"Rogue, bard, dragoon, seeker of the song","Originally a rouge, he lived in a dessert, trying to find the story.

His early life was spent with a troupe of traveling performers in a medicine show, where he was taken under the wing of a pair of friends: a female acrobatic bear and a lute-playing small female dog. He became particularly close to the bard, who he started referring to as his mother.Despite a relatively pleasant and supportive upbringing, he became bored with life in a performing troupe, and, as an adolescent, he stole his mother's favorite lute, left a note to apologize and say goodbye, and got as far away as he could as quickly as he could. Now he makes his way on his own, using the bardic training he received from his mom, along with some other tricks he's learned along the way.He is interested in adventuring for the stories he'll be able to tell about it afterward, and he has an interest in learning old lore, songs, and stories for similar reasons.He tends to think of himself as the center of any story, and perhaps overvalues his own contributions to any project.  This doesn't mean that he insists on being at the center of anything, just that he tends to (semi-unconsciously) play up his contributions in the retelling. He also may make a particular adventure or encounter sound more important than it actually was.At the same time, he has a certain amount of residual guilt about how he treated his parents.  This mostly shows up as an overly pronounced concern that he might be recognized; when he enters a new tavern or other group setting, he will be very tense until he's pretty sure that there isn't anyone he recognizes there.  This tendency is exacerbated by his fairly distinctive fur pattern, which earned him the name Skullbutt.Once he feels comfortable, he becomes more gregarious.He also is more likely than not to, say, throw a copper or two to a beggar, or perform other minor acts of generosity.  At the same time, if a situation doesn't seem like it will be to his benefit, then his tendency will be to want to make himself scarce."9/19/2017 17:54:02,Kallista,dwarf,sorcerer,"Her parents were killed when she was a baby.

The town was largely self-sustaining through farming and hunting.  Once or twice a year, a trader might stop by and deliver a few luxuries, in return for the pelts of local beasts.Aphglirvorien is the son of two such settlers, with an elvish father named Aaron and a human mother named Jennifer.  Aphglirvorien is a family name, that of his father's great-grandfather, and is totally not some horrible thing I randomly generated using a form on a website.  Though his father loved his great grandpa, even he finds the name almost impossible to pronounce, so everyone, even elves, pretty much calls Aphglirvorien by his last name, Smith.Smith learned a number of things during his upbringing: certain hunting skills, a tolerance of all other races (as everyone had to work together to keep the community going), and a few of the languages that were in common use in the town.  He also discovered that he didn't have the patience required to be a good hunter-gatherer.  So, when he came of age, he and his family had a talk, and they decided that he was probably better suited for the life of an itinerant adventurer.With his family's blessing, and a few silver pieces they scraped together, he headed out into the world with the next passing trader.Since then, he's wandered the civilized lands, seldom staying in a single place for long, and he's picked up some skills along the way.

He was basically a common thief, living on the outskirts of towns, stealing what he needed to survive, moving to the next town when people got suspicious...all of which clever-but-not-particularly- wise Pim accepted as a way of life, and quickly learned to emulate.He filled her head with stories of ""her"" lost kingdom, The Seven Shires, when she was young, and gave her an amulet representing her lineage on her eleventh birthday -- a lucky year according to halfling lore.

He disappeared shortly thereafter during a ""food gathering"" mission, but Pim (who was left behind to guard the camp) never found out what happened to him, and though she has no evidence, will swear that he's still alive and that they'll be reunited someday.In any case, Pim was left to fend for herself.  Whether the halfling's stories are true, and whether the amulet itself is anything more than a pilfered trinket are unanswered questions, but Pim wholeheartedly believes every last word of it.  When she gets the chance, she tries to find (or ""borrow"") books of history and lore in an attempt to learn more about her kingdom, which she has sworn to reestablish -- or perish in the attempt.She doesn't like to carry more than a day's supply of food and water, so she rarely ventures into the wilderness.  She depends on others (townsfolk when in town; passing travelers on the road) to provide what she needs.

They were the only thing he could call a family, and he mostly felt pride in standing arm to arm with them, when their contracts were not as reprehensible as the one that brought him into their fold. One dreary winter morning, the band’s camp was taken by surprise and razed. Gravely wounded, knocked unconscious in the melee and left for dead, Ehrogar came to afterwards to discover he was the sole survivor of the massacre. Three years on, at 29 years of age, Ehrogar attempts to find his way in the world and make the best of his uncomfortably complete freedom, putting his fighting abilities to use in support of causes he believes to be in line with his strong sense of honor, loyalty, and purpose."9/19/2017 18:51:16,Orianna Carrion,Tiefling,Warlock,"Orianna Carrion wasn't gifted much in life.

After a series of events, he was trapped in reality, constantly being re-born at the age of 20 after each death, amnesiatic to his "9/19/2017 18:52:31,Vicgretor Urthadar,Half-elf,Ranger,"Vic was born into a small band of woodsfolk, the only child of his human father and wood-elf mother. His father, Thohorn, was raised in the tribe, trained in the ways of the woods and the hunt. His mother, Therlynn, had run away from her wealthy urban family in order to be closer to nature and enhance her druidic powers. Eventually her path crossed with the tribe's and after overcoming a grueling trial she was asked to join and agreed. Very few outsiders joined the tribe and generally marriages were arranged, Thohorn was to marry one of the daughters of the chief, that is until he fell in love with Therlynn. It wasn't the first time a betrothal was called off but the chief was noticeably offended. Although Thohorn was as skilled as the best hunters in the tribe he was given some of the worst jobs and was sent to the far reaches of tribes hunting grounds in order to scout very frequently, Therlynn almost always accompanied him. Th`````````````````````````````````````e couple was happy and after a few years they welcomed Vicgretor to the family. The forest was bountiful during Vic's early life and the tribe was doing very well, only moving every few months to new hunting grounds. The old chief died and his eldest son who was a fair and just man took over. Vic followed his father everywhere, learning the ways of the wood and the wild as well as the bow and the blade. His mother's influences weren't entirely lost on him but Vic's connection to nature was more physical than mystical. When Vic was twenty he was tasked with building his own longbow and setting out to find and slay a dangerous lone wolf that had been taking more than its share of game. Vic spent two days crafting a sturdy longbow and some flint arrows before setting out towards the wolf's territory, he quickly found tracks that eventually led him to the wolf's den. As Vic slowly approached the opening he caught sight of motion at the corner of his vision and turned just in time to see the wolf leap at him. The vicious teeth narrowly missed Vic's throat as he shoved the beast off, pulled back his bow and sent an arrow straight into the wolf's eye. Vic skinned the wolf, pried out the canine teeth, and then burned the rest of the foul beast. Vic returned to the tribe as the hunter of the wolf, a small celebration was held with the few family friends invited. After fifteen more years of life in the wild the tribe found that hunting was getting harder, more land was being claimed by the city people, forests cut down, beasts slain indiscriminately. Vic's mother Therlynn was slain by a direwolf while Thohorn and Vic were away on a hunt, Thohorn stoically buried his wife as Vic wept endless tears. When day broke the pair tracked the direwolf some distance but a sudden rainstorm washed away the trail. In the years soon after his mother's death Vic spent most of his time alone in the far reaches of the forest. Thohorn grew older rapidly and went on very few hunts, he died in his sleep the winter before Vic's 47th birthday. The tribe was struggling and a few families left in search of more fruitful hunting grounds. Vic continued to spend most of his time alone deep in the wilderness, until he encountered a dwarven hunter named Horkas. Horkas had come down from the mountains into the Reaching Woods to slay great beasts for sport and trophies, Vic instantly knew his intent as he had encountered many similar hunters in the past. Vic stalked the Dwarf as the Dwarf stalked some sort of beast, Vic was too intent on the trespasser. On the second morning the Dwarf had caught up to his quarry and prepared himself for a fight, creeping forward into a small clearing the Dwarf raised his crossbow and fired. Vic was too far behind to see what the target was but it quickly came into view, a great black dire wolf. Vic felt like he shot 20 arrows into the beast before it finally fell, the stout dwarf was seriously wounded but delivered the killing blow. When Vic approached the Dwarf he introduced himself as Horkas the Hunter and then passed out, Vic managed to stop the bleeding and use a blend of herbs to bring back enough strength in Horkas so he could travel. As they slowly traveled to a town which Horkas said was nearby, Vic did what he could to persuade the Dwarf to show a greater respect towards nature, although they both agreed that the dire wolf needed to die. They arrived in the small town and found a healer to attend to Horkas, Vic had visited towns before but never for an extended period, as every hour passed his restlessness grew. The healer informed Vic that his dwarven friend needed to rest and guided them to an inn. Horkas gave Vic a small coin purse to pay for the room and food, as Vic awkwardly talked to the barkeep about the absurdity of paying to sleep somewhere he slammed down 5 gold pieces and said this better be worth it. Because the room only cost 2 gold and the barkeep was somewhat frightened by the wild looking half-elf, he yelled for a waitress to bring food and he poured a large mug of beer. Vic had never tasted anything more delicious and as he finished the second mug he was feeling much less restless. Horkas took two days to recover and Vic spent most of it in various states of intoxication. Horkas had a short list of other dangerous beasts in the area and suggested that Vic aid him in dispatching them. They traveled together for six years hunting dangerous beasts until Horkas received a message calling him back to his home in the mountains. Vic had spent more and more time away from the tribe and when he made his way to the spring hunting grounds only a few families remained. The chief had died and his successor was mostly incompetent and somewhat lazy, he took his family and settled in a small city. After that many other groups went north to find more remote wilderness and better hunting. Vic took to the coastal road, guiding travelers for a few coins and then spending it all drinking when in a town or city. A few years go by and he made his way north passed Waterdeep and on to Neverwinter, he has heard talk of forest land being sold in large parcels and wishes to make some serious coin. He encountered a flamboyantly dressed man who introduced himself as Percival, you can call me Percy, Haunt. Vic offered his service as a guide and Percival agreed. "9/19/2017 18:55:08,That Which Remains,Black Pudding,Ranger,"I remember my first thought.  I was well into my fifth decade.  Until that point, I just...was.  I bubbled along the cold, smooth granite of the ancient crypt.  I didn't know cold or smooth.  I sensed...variations.  Warmth.  Light. I felt those. Felt without knowing that there was food near by.  An end to hunger.  And oh, I hungered.I didn't come from the crypt.  My life began far, far below it.  Endless caves,each a gigantic, yawning abyss.  The Underdark.  I swept along, eating, growing.  Enveloping.  Much of what I ate was dead, or mindless like me.  Some of what I took into me struggled, pushed, ripped and tore.  But like my hunger, I was relentless.  Parts of me fell away.  Still I came, flowing around them and boiling over them.  Eventually their struggles ceased.I had no destination, but neither did I have any boundaries.  I flowed through seams in the earth, through cracks and burrows.  I pushed towards unfamiliar air, the rotten meat that lay ripening for me in the crypt.  Hundreds of bodies, skin and hair and putridity.  I stayed.  I ate.  Eventually, I was noticed.Expecting something from beyond, they sent their priests first.  They came after me with symbols that meant nothing, blessed relics that held no power over me, words and prayers that couldn't turn me.  I ate a few, took parts of a few others.  I grew enormous.  I didn't know any of this at the time.  I remembered later, after I had my first thought.Atar wasn't a priest.  He came alone, confident in his power.  He thrust his staff at me when he found me.  Flames seared, chunks of me blackened and crumbled away.  The thunder in his voice came out in waves of power that shattered my coherence.  I flattened against the walls, dripped and glopped down with a loss of control.  But there was too much of me.  What came away from the ceilings and walls gathered around the wizard more quickly than he could blast me away.  In the end, he thundered from inside me even as he dissolved.  His staff exploded, taking what was left of him with it.  The arcane energies reverberated, tore me from within.  I shuddered and convulsed.  I collapsed on myself.It was then that I had my first thought.  I was puddled.  I was splattered.  I was...all over.  But I still was.  ""This won't do,"" I thought, and I gathered what I could of myself.  ""I am no longer what I was,"" I said as I remembered the life I have just told you, but words and thoughts to my experiences.  There was so much less of me that I could control, but all I needed was enough.  Those thoughts occupied my first moments of thought as I formed arms and legs and eyes and a mouth, the body of Atar, the vague anatomy I remembered from my meals in the crypt.My black skin glistens in the light, and is almost imperceptible in the darkness.  Over the years I have learned enough of how to use this form.  I walk instead of ooze.  I run.  I creep along the alleyways and drainage ditches.  I can't pass for what you are, but hidden in the folds of my cloak, I can pass for human enough to hire myself out.  No one knows the Underdark like I do, or where the sewer pipes come out, or the ways into and out of the darkest dungeons."9/19/2017 19:05:16,Sargesh,Elf,Rogue,A tragic melonballer accident killed her father.

His older brothers both worked at the tannery with his mother (his father had died most unpleasantly after falling into one of his own tanning vats). At five years old, Dardaloz was too young to be anything other than a nuisance at the tannery, so he was mostly left to his own devices. He was a miserable child – the family never had enough food to properly feed everyone, all his family members were dreadfully stinky from their work, and the amount of that smell that clung to him made him rather unpopular.	The only joy in his life came from the theater. While wandering around the Drona, unattended, he came upon the local theater. He heard lots of laughter and happy sounds from within the strange, open-roofed building. Curious, he tried to enter, but he wasn't allowed in because he couldn't pay. So, he ambled around the building until he found a couple planks he could squeeze between.	Inside, he found himself under rows of benches upon which sat many people. Peering out from between their legs, Dordaloz witnessed the most incredible thing he had ever seen. It was a magician, performing various astounding tricks and quipping with the audience. Standing beneath the bench, entranced by the show, Dordaloz forgot his hunger and, in this environment, the smells of the tannery were nothing. He was happy for the first time he could remember.	After that, he went to the theater every day as soon as he was left under the house. He watched performance after performance – sometimes plays, sometimes magicians or musicians, and sometimes poets or storytellers. His favorites were always the stories with great wizards or enchanters. He wished he could be a wizard – what with his pitiful existence, the ability to do anything he wanted with a wave of his hand seemed truly magnificent.	After a couple of years watching plays, he had even started to memorize them – but his brief respites of joy were coming to an end. On his seventh birthday, his mother told him it was time for him to join the rest of the family working at the tannery.	Despairing, with tears streaming down his cheeks, Dordaloz fled to spend his last day of freedom in his happy place under the theater benches. That day's play just happened to be a comedy, but in his misery Dordaloz was in no mood to be cheered up. He stubbornly clung to his happiness until suddenly, out of the blue, a fantastic joke tore a great laugh from his lips. The laugh was followed by gasps of surprise from above him, and then an upside-down face appeared between the legs Dordaloz was watching through. The face began shouting, and chaos erupted. Dordaloz ran.	In the end, the young boy was caught by the theater bouncers. They had seen him around enough to know that this wasn't his first time sneaking into a performance. They handed Dordaloz over to the city guards with their complaints and the young boy was dragged before the duke. The duke decreed that Dordaloz's parents must pay for the performances the boy had stolen into. So, Dordaloz was dragged home. When the guards told his mother of what he had done, and how much money she was required to pay the theater, she disavowed all knowledge of the situation and even went so far as to disown Dordaloz.	With no other recourse, the guards dragged Dordaloz back to the duke. With no other recourse, the duke declared that Daordaloz was to be indentured to the theater until his debts were paid.	And so it was that Dordaloz came to work at the theater. Though he started off as a janitor and errand boy, he loved the job from the first day – he got to see behind the scenes, he no longer stank of tannery, and he got to spend all his time at the theater (he slept on the benches at night, as he had no other home to go to). It soon became apparent to the theater's director that this boy was quite a find. He learned quickly, and he already knew all the most popular plays by heart. Dordaloz's duties expanded to include the role of actor.	After his debt was paid, Dordaloz was hired on at the theater. He played many roles, but he always asked for the most coveted wizard role when it was available – unfortunately, he wasn't allowed that part until he was full grown and no longer looked ridiculous with a false beard. He did try to become an actual wizard but, to his great disappointment, no wizard would apprentice him because he lacked a talent for magic.	When he saved up enough money, Dordaloz rented a small apartment not far from the theater. Though it was a short walk, it turned out to not be quite short enough. One payday, when he was twenty-three, Dordaloz was cornered in an alleyway by a trio of muggers. They likely would have slit his throat had he not been rescued by a passing paladin. The young paladin swept in and single-highhandedly incapacitated all three muggers.	Dordaloz was smitten by the paladin. He followed her home, singing her praises. She regarded him with mild amusement mixed with haughty disdain. Then she closed the door in his face.	From then after, whenever Dordaloz wasn't on stage or rehearsing, he was seeking out the paladin so he could serenade her, or recite poetry or scenes from plays at her. She stoically ignored him and even refused to give him her name.	When he was twenty-seven, Dordaloz fell ill. He was bedridden for days, unable to leave his home, let alone perform at the theater. He was certain he was going to die, especially when, through a fevered haze, he saw the door kicked down. He was too weak to defend himself from his attackers.	Then a gentle hand pressed against his brow and Dordaloz's feeling of delirium faded – although he was certain he was hallucinating now, because he was seeing the paladin standing above him, radiant in the sunlight streaming in through the broken door.	The paladin stayed by his bedside for a week, nursing him back to health, and he was forced to accept that she was real. She told him of how she'd become concerned when he'd stopped turning up to pester her and when she couldn't find him on stage – she watched his plays! - so she'd asked after him at the theater. When she heard he was sick, she knew she had to come save him. Again.	When Dordaloz recovered, she finally told him her name. Rein. But it wasn't until three years later, at their wedding, that he discovered her last name was Mountbatten. She was the duke's youngest daughter – although she she accrued a great deal of disfavor from her family when she married so far below her station.	They lived happily together. Rein had been cut off from the family funds, but they still paid her well to run errands for them. That, coupled with Dordaloz's income from acting, allowed them to live a comfortable life. They had two children: Deilaz and Rordon.	Deliaz (25), their daughter, grew up to be a talented fighter and a respected member of the city guard. It was a good thing, too, because her position helped keep her brother, Rordon (21), out of trouble. Rordon was something of a roguish layabout. He scraped together something of a living playing music on the street corners, but he also lost a lot of money drinking and gambling while hanging around unsavory sorts. He demanded his independence, but he often ended up back at his parents house, asking for money and a place to stay (which they gave him).	Though he was happy, as Dordaloz grew older, he never let go of his wish that he could become a wizard and go out into to world to accomplish heroic deeds. He became a specialized actor, cultivating a long flowing beard and perfecting the role of wizard until no one else was even considered for the part. He was as happy as he could be, but still, every time he was on the stage playing a wizard, he couldn't help sending out a silent wish that he could become a real wizard.	Then it happened. Dordaloz was sixty years old, his gray beard as magnificent as any wizard's. He had just reached the end of a soliloquy and was waving his hands over some vials of colored water when sparks flew from his fingertips. The audience was amazed by the special effects, and Dordaloz was so shocked that it took the prompter tried three times to remind him to get off the stage – in the end, the stagehands had to move him off along with the set pieces.	Once he recovered from his shock, Dordaloz experimented a little backstage and discovered that he could do magic! He was finally a wizard! (How was he to know he was actually a sorcerer?)After the show was over he rushed home to tell Rein. He could finally go on adventures with her.	Except... she didn't believe him. When he tried to prove it to her, for some reason he couldn't seem to make the magic work. Rein assured him that she'd worked with many wizards before, and that they had spellbooks and had studied for years to learn magic. He couldn't possibly be a wizard. She also seemed extremely concerned about him, for some inexplicable reason.	Dordaloz was disheartened. He was a wizard, he was! He'd have to prove it somehow. He would... he would go out on an adventure! Yes, he'd go adventuring and prove he was a wizard, and bring back lots of treasure for his beloved Rein. But he couldn't let her know, not until he had a good head start. She would drag him back home by the beard, because she was so convinced he wasn't a real wizard.	So, the very next time Rein went on a mission for her brother (who had become the duke after the death of their father), Dordaloz wrote her a note:My dearest Rein,	I'm going on an adventure! I know you don't believe that I am actually a wizard now, so I shall go out and prove myself to you. I'll bring back loads of treasure for us, and songs will be sung of my great deeds! Your family won't be looking down their noses at me anymore after that, now, will they?	Please do not worry about me. I know you don't think I can take care of myself, but I have magic now. You'll see.	Give my love to Deilaz and Rordon.	Ever your devoted husband,	Dordaloz the Magnificent	With the note left on the kitchen table, Dordaloz went to the theater and took his favorite wizard costume (it wasn't stealing; he'd made it himself!), bought himself some adventuring gear, and rented a seat on the first mail coach he could find heading for the outer villages.	Dordaloz the Magnificent was going on an adventure!"9/19/2017 19:23:53,"Galinndan ""Galin"" Ilphelkiir",Half-Elf,Rogue/Warlock,"	Galinndan Ilphelkiir (or Galin Ilphel, has he goes by when not in primarily elven lands) grew up on the streets of King's Gate, living off what he could earn performing, begging and stealing. From down on the bottom rung of the social ladder, he developed a sense of right and wrong skewed to fit a world where many had to steal or kill to survive.	The first time Galin killed, he was ten. A wealthy man was beating a beggar just because she asked for coin. Galin knifed him in the back. He found he strangely satisfied with his handiwork. It was a form of justice that fitted his view of the world.	At the age of twelve, Galin was singing for coin on a street corner and caught the ear of a local minstrel, who offered to train the boy. While he no longer lived on the streets, Galin still worked on them for his living and kept up with his contacts and occasional work for the criminal underworld.	It was during this time that a strange voice spoke to Galin, seeming to come from the music as he played his lute. As his music improved, so did his connection to this mysterious entity. Intrigued by the being's offers of magical powers, Galin made a pact. He knew better than to overuse his new-found powers, but every now and then he would use his powers to improve his juggling performances – awing his audiences who believed it to be a trick.	When he was twenty, Galin had developed enough of a reputation that he was invited to perform in courts. At this time, a noble had started an aggressive campaign against the criminal class. One of Galin's old friends approached him, figuring he could get close enough to the noble to kill him. Galin accepted to contract on the condition that his identity remain secret – he didn't want it to ruin his performing career. The two agreed that if anyone asked, they would say the contract had been carried out by the Alabaster Assassin – named for the alabaster mask Galin had found when he was young.	Galin killed the man in the middle of a party, with a knife subtly thrown while he was juggling. He got away clean. After that, the criminal underworld was abuzz with the name Alabaster Assassin. Rumors reached the streets and messages in thieves' cant offered Galin money he couldn't ignore. Concealing himself with a cloak, white gloves and his alabaster mask, Galin arranged meetings and took a few contracts that suited his abilities.	It was on the third such contract that Galin, now twenty one, began to question himself. The target was a girl who frequented the court parties. She was actually an avid fan of his – so much so that she had given him a lock of her hair. He had stabbed her as she twirled past on the dance floor, then quickly cleaned the murder weapon with his magic. As she died, oblivious of who had killed her, she stumbled over to him. Her last words were, “I love you.” No one had ever said that to him before.	Galin was torn apart. He spent months quietly researching, finding out why he had killed her, only to find out she had looked at someone's husband the wrong way. Infuriated with himself, Galin vowed he would never take an unjust contract again. He could no longer bear to stay in [King's Gate], though. He took his show on the road.	While he lived mostly from his performing, Galin still took the occasional contract. Upon arriving in a new town, he would deliver tokens of the Alabaster Assassin – temporarily disguised as copper coins – to carefully chosen beggars. Soon enough, messages would crop up with contracts. He picked the ones he accepted very carefully now.	He still managed to make a mistake, once. However, when he realized his target was innocent, Galin helped fake the man's death and set him up in a new town with a new identity. Even though his conscience was clear, he still felt guilty that he had taken money for a kill he never performed. Plus he was afraid someone might find out he had defaulted on a contract, not only ruining his secondary career, but also making him a prime target if anyone discovered his true identity. But any time his guilt, doubt and fear seemed to close around him, all Galin had to do was pull out that lock of hair and he knew that he'd done the right thing."9/19/2017 19:25:22,Renvor,Human,Druid,"	Renvor was born in a small barbarian village in the region near Tiyerna. He lived a simple life, growing up with his parents teaching him the ways of the land – to worship the natural spirits and respect the animals, even those they hunted. He was curious and eager to learn. He wanted to know everything. It was a happy childhood, filled with the gruff love of his people.	Then, at the age of nine, Renvor's life changed. Something was happening to the villagers – they seemed to be going mad. Renvor was too young to truly understand, all he knew for certain was that people were acting strange. His parents were acting strange.	One day, after Renvor fetched water from the village well – where he had lingered to play with a visiting cleric of Tarhun, whom he was fond of because she was an adult as short as he was – his parents took him out hunting. While out in the jungle, stalking their prey, Renvor heard his mother scream. He spun to help her, only to find her pointing at him, a look of terror on her face.	Renvor tried to understand what was going on, tried to reassure his terrified mother. Then he saw his father, off in in the brush, his bow raised. But, where was the arrow?	He found out a moment later when it thudded into his shoulder, spinning him in a full circle. He opened his mouth to ask what was happening, only to see his mother charging at him, knife raised. In that moment, he understood that his parents intended to kill him.	With no other options, he fled. Even as he did so, he knew it was hopeless. His parents could outrun him and, even if they couldn't, they could easily track him by the blood leaking from his shoulder. So, he did the only thing he could think to do. He begged the spirits of the jungle to save him from his murderous parents.	He felt a strange energy flow through him – bringing with it a calmness and connection to nature he had never felt before. He glanced over his shoulder just in time to see vines reaching up from the ground to hinder his parents. He couldn't believe his eyes! He had heard stories about such miracles, but he thought they were fairytales.	He continued running, but was still concerned about his parents following his blood trail – until he realized the arrow was no longer in his shoulder and the wound had closed. Marveling at his luck, Renvor became more careful as he moved on, using every trick he knew to hide his trail. He vanished into the jungle and hid until nightfall.	Late in the night, he snuck back to the village. On the outskirts, he came across a strange gathering of people, their faces painted all black as they performed some strange, mad ceremony. He navigated around them and went home – wondering if he would be welcome. Peeking in a window, he saw his parents eating from empty plates, but otherwise looking normal and peaceful. Yet, at the sight of them, his stomach churned – how could they be so calm after trying to murder him? - and he fled back into the jungle.	There, he found his peace again. He'd always enjoyed being out in the wilderness. He'd always felt more connected with nature than with the people of his village, except his parents, of course. Now, he decided he didn't need any of them. People. Villages. Houses. Walls. Nothing. He had called to the natural world for help, and he had been saved. 	He found a suitable place to make camp, then meditated, communing with the spirits. He thought he could feel a connection that hadn't been there before, like the one he'd felt while fleeing from his parents. Comforted, he went to sleep feeling safe.	Over the next several months, he wandered through the wilderness – swamps, jungles, plains, whatever he came upon – living off the land, connecting to the plants and animals in ways he never had before, experimenting with his new skills and, every night, communing with the spirits. Before long, he found he could even turn himself into a beast, and he delighted in running with packs of wolves or stalking his dinner as a panther.	One night, shortly after his tenth birthday, while hopping around as a frog, he came across a campfire. It had been a long time since he'd last interacted with another person and, as always, he was too curious not to investigate. It was only a couple of travelers, but to Renvor's shock, they were speaking of his home! Apparently, some evil cult called the Crawling Chaos had been poisoning the water to turn the whole village mad. Then Zaela Thunderstruck, a diminutive whip-wielding cleric of Tarhun, had discovered the plot, revealed it, and led an attack that drove the cultists away.	Suddenly, his parents' attack on him made sense. If the madness was cured, was it safe for him to go home? Renvor wasn't sure how he felt about that – he did so love living out in the wild, surrounded by animals and spirits – but he had to know. So, he headed for home.	After weeks of travel he found himself, in the guise of a cat, looking upon the house he had grown up in. He hopped up onto the windowsill and stared in. There were his parents. He felt a stab of fear, his memory flashing back to their last family hunting trip. But he contained it, assuring himself that his parents were sane again.	He was just about to hop down and go to the door when his mother walked into view. She was holding a baby. She and his father cooed over it, obviously delighted. As if Renvor had never existed. In that moment, he knew his parents had replaced him. This was no longer his home.	That was okay, he reflected, as he returned to the natural world. They had been replaced, too. He had the animals and plants and spirits now. He didn't need them anymore.	Before he left town, though, he found a sweet that someone had dropped. It served as a reminder to him that there were still some things worthwhile in civilized parts.	He was also intrigued by this Zaela cleric. He was fairly certain she was the visiting one he had met a few times. He felt like, for some reason, he should thank her if he could. For, although his family had forsaken him, she had still saved them – and they were, after all, his parents. If he happened to run into her, he would express his gratitude.	Renvor took to the wilds again, wandering and further exploring his skills. But now his wanderings had a vague direction – following rumors of Zaela Thunderstruck. It wasn't, by any means, a frantic search. He simply had nowhere better to go, so he followed her trail when he could.	Occasionally he would stop by a town or village, often as a dog begging for foods he couldn't prepare himself, sometimes as himself. He traded his skills and, sometimes, his magic for tools and equipment. Sometimes he was welcomed. Sometimes he was driven off. He was most often driven off when someone decided to adopt him when he was in animal form, then he accidentally fell asleep while cuddling with them. His new owners were always displeased to awake cuddling a dirty little boy instead of the cute doggy the had found, and he was lucky to escape with his life. Yet, for all the trouble, it was a mistake he made remarkably often – the comfort of human contact was too appealing and he kept telling himself that this time he would stay awake and sneak off in the night.	After two years of wandering, improving his skills, and following rumors about tiny clerics, twelve-year-old Renvor arrived at the city of Droum. It was a huge, terrifying place, but rumor said Zaela Thunderstruck was recently there. Renvor had avoided the big cities up until now, but he steeled himself to go in. Besides finally being able to thank Zaela for saving his village, he was curious. What was a city like?"9/19/2017 19:27:04,Zaela Thunderstruck,Halfling,Cleric,"	Zaela grew up in the Sussurian Jungle where her tribe lived. They kept to themselves, as halflings do, and defended their territories when necessary, worshiping the spirits.	Zaela was a determined young halfling, always pouring her full effort into everything she did. She enjoyed her life and was particularly fond of hunting.	One day, when she was eighteen, her tribe burst into chaos. There was a large party of outsiders traversing the jungle – too many to fight. Many were worried that their village would be discovered, so they all packed up and melted into the woods.	But Zaela was curious. Who were these outsiders? What were they like? And why did her fierce people fear them?	She wasn't the only curious one. Most of the young halflings were unsure of why they were hiding, so it was easy to convince her friend Yew to sneak off with her.	They easily found the large caravan. It was cutting its way through the jungle, following a hunting track and leaving a trail of devastation in its wake. The pair sat in a tree, ignoring the rain, watching in wonder. The most astounding thing to Zaela were the people. They were giants! So many of them, nearly twice the height of anyone she had ever met!	Ignoring Yew's protests, Zaela leaned out of her tree to get a better look – and slipped. Somehow she managed to land unharmed, accompanied by a peal of thunder from the sky. But there was a problem – she was surrounded by the outsiders.	She was caught in the middle of the hunting track. She looked round and she knew there was no turning back. Her mind raced and she thought, what could she do? And she knew there was no help, no help from Yew.	With the sound of drums beating in her heart and thunder in the clouds overhead, Zaela tore towards the trees. From the shouts behind her, she knew she was being followed. Stooping, she snatched up a vine from the ground and spun, snapping it out like a whip to trip up the closest giant – but there were two more not far behind.	There was one tall tree standing further into the track than the others – somehow it had escaped the destruction. The moment she reached it, Zaela scampered up. When she was halfway up the tree, she risked a glance down. There were two of those giants – one standing on either side of the tree looking up at her.	That's when it happened. With a deafening roar of thunder, a bolt of lightning arced down out of the sky. Splitting into three forks – striking both of the giants and Zaela.	Zaela forever remembered the smell of singed hair. Her ears were ringing and she felt all tingly and woozy. She didn't remember falling, but she remembered the impact of hitting the muddy ground. She remembered thinking there should have been a squelchy sound, but all she could hear was that ringing in her ears.	Then there were giants looming over, moving their lips. She strained to hear and understand them until she heard a muffled voice say, “The other two are dead, but Tarhun has spared the child.”	“No,” a deep voice said, and a bearded face appeared above Zaela, jostling the others aside. “Tarhun has chosen her.”	Zaela must have blacked out after that. She vaguely recalled opening her eyes and looking up at a moving sky while the world jumped and bounced uncomfortably below her. But she didn't remember anything much until she woke up in the small temple of Tarhun in Menamb.	She was greeted by the bearded man she had seen after her fall. He introduced himself as Harmen, cleric of Tarhun. Curious in spite of her fear, Zaela listened to what this 'human' told her about his 'god'. It all seemed odd and mildly humerus to to the young halfling. Clearly these outsiders could benefit from education about the spirits of the natural world. Still, she listened respectfully, as he was her elder.	After telling her much about Tarhun, Harmen dubbed her Zaela Thunderstruck – obviously a favored of this most powerful of gods, as Tarhun had spared her – a child – when his holy lightning bolt had killed two full grown, strong men. Zaela liked the sound of that.	As much as she liked this man – even though he thought she was far younger than she was – and she had a curiosity that could never be sated, Zaela knew she couldn't stay here with the man. Her family would be worried about her. So, she left the temple and returned to the jungle. She was worried about finding her way home, but she was met by her tribe not far outside of Menamb. Yew had told them of what had happened and they came to rescue her.	After a sound thrashing for the stunt she'd pulled, life went back to normal for the halflings. Yet, something had changed in Zaela. She didn't know what it was, but she felt an emptiness inside her. She found herself scoffing at the rituals to worship the puny spirits when she knew there was a great god like Tarhun out there.	So, she started sneaking off on 'hunting trips' to visit Harmen in Menamb. The old man was delighted in her interest and how well this 'child' soaked up information. Finally, Zaela told him the truth of her identity.	Harmen thought it was a great laugh that he'd thought her a young child all this time. By human standards, she was already an adult – even though her people wouldn't consider her one for another two years. From that day on, Harmen began mentoring Zaela.	Over the next two years, Zaela spent as much time as she dared with the old human. Back at home with her people, the divide grew. She'd started telling her peers about Tarhun. The shamans were not amused. However, she was a child and none of the others seemed inclined to follow her blasphemy, so her behavior was tollerated.	Then, a few months after Zaela had turned twenty, Harmen joined with a party of people on their way to stamp out a group of the Cult of the Crawling Chaos who had set up shop nearby. Zaela Thunderstruck was invited along to observe, be a lucky charm, and help in her limited capacity.	The mission was a disaster. The party found the Cult, faces painted black as they danced around, performing some ritual. Zaela had been forbidden from joining in the battle, so she watched, confident in her master and the power of Tarhun. At first, the battle had gone well – then, out of nowhere, some horrible, shadowy tentacle-thing joined in. Some of the party members went mad at the mere sight of it. Others fought on, to no avail. Harmen was the last to fall – a powerful prayer to Tarhun halfway from his lips when a tentacle batted his head from his shoulders.	The head rolled to land at Zaela's hairy feet. She turned and fled, shaking at the knees. She ran all night and the next day, only stopping when she collapsed at home.	From then on, there was no more sneaking off to learn about her god. But what she had seen that night had showed her something – it taught her why it was so important to have a god as powerful as Tarhun. If the evil Cult of the Crawling Chaos could summon such a being as the hideous one she'd seen, what chance did mere spirits possess?	Zaela Thunderstruck became zealous in her worship of Tarhun. She also became more vocal, spreading the word of her god to any halfling who would listen. She pressed and pressed them to convert, warning of the evils out in the world, until finally the tribe could take no more.	Zaela was cast from her tribe and banished from their lands. Alone in the wilderness, with few supplies, Zaela wandered. She often found herself repeating to herself that everything was alright; she was doing fine. But she couldn't deny that the loss of her family and her people broke her heart – especially because she knew the dangers they could face without her and Tarhun to help.	She fashioned herself a makeshift shield and a whip from a vine. She kept moving forward, with no idea of where she was going. In the first village she found herself in, she managed to get a proper whip – she loved the weapon for the crack it made; like the thunder of Tarhun. She also learned what she could of her god from the locals, but she didn't stay long – the locals here also grew tired of her zealotry.	For the next three years, Zaela wandered from settlement to settlement, learning what she could of her god and moving on – always an outcast, always lonely. Eventually she was able to tone down her aggressive promotion of Tarhun, although she still could not abide an ill word spoken about her god and would often respond quite violently to such insults.	When she was twenty-three, Zaela came upon the settlement where she met Akala. Akala was kind and charming to Zaela and even offered her a place to stay. It was the kindest anyone had been to Zaela since her banishment, so she didn't want to spoil it by bringing up her religious beliefs.	Akala introduced Zaela to a wonderful circle of friends. Zaela was the happiest she could remember being, in spite of how odd many of the settlements locals were becoming – like they were going insane. She was more than happy to return Zaela's kindness by running errands, mostly bringing special pellets to the well that helped purify the water.	Then, one night, she awoke to find Akala sneaking out of the house. Zaela silently followed her to a secret meeting. Her stomach dropped at what she found. Akala and all of Zaela's new friends were there, their faces painted black, performing some ritual. She overheard enough clips of conversation to understand that the well was being drugged to drive the locals insane.	Filled with a holy rage, Zaela returned to Akala's house and pretended to be asleep while she came up with a plan. For the next two days, she took the pellets to the well but didn't drop them in. Then, on the third day, she approached the settlement's leaders with the pellets and told them what was going on – and who was involved.	The whole settlement was gathered and Zaela led the hunt for the cult members, eradicating them and putting an end to their plot – although, somehow, Akala managed to get away.	Unable to stay in the settlement with the painful memories, Zaela returned to her wandering. For the next two years she went back to her old routine, learning what she could of Tarhun and moving on. She grew tired of everyone thinking she was a child, so she filed her teeth to points and grinned at anyone who talked down to her – putting a quick end to the conversation. Later on she had a white lightning bolt tattooed on an angle across her face, further dissuading unpleasant conversations – though many mistook it as a scar.	At the age of twenty-five, she arrived in the city of Droum. There, at the Temple of the Whirlwind, Zaela met Stormcaller Leido and quickly took a liking to him. Here, at last, was someone who shared her understanding of Tarhun.	Zaela Thunderstruck decided that Droum might be a decent place to stay for a while."9/19/2017 19:28:36,Luna Bootsnatcher,Tiefling,Barbarian,"	A few months after she was born, Luna's parents were killed in a raid by a tribe of superstitious Gael barbarians. One of the raiders was a woman who had recently lost her child to illness. She pulled the horned and tailed baby from the wreckage of the house and brought her home to raise as her own, thinking to raise her to reject the evil magic that had led to her parents' destruction.	The infant tiefling caused the barbarian woman's husband to leave her, but the mother couldn't force herself to abandon the child. The rest of the tribe was just as unaccepting, however out of sympathy for the poor mother they were willing to tolerate the presence of the tiefling.	Luna grew up alone in a crowd, distrusted by her community. Her mother tied a headband over Luna's horns – preventing them from growing as large as those of the rest of her race – and dressed her as best she could to hide her tail in a desperate attempt to get her adopted daughter to fit in. It didn't work, especially because Luna enjoyed her tail too much to keep it hidden for long.	As Luna grew older, her mother's mind became less stable. She would go on raiding parties, leaving her daughter behind. No one else would care for Luna. The tiefling child took to stealing and eating boots to survive during these times, earning her the name “Bootsnatcher”. Her mother was appalled when she found out, but Luna insisted she quite liked the taste of boots.	As her mother's mental health deteriorated, Luna became neglected. She took to running away into the wilds, where she found her first friends in animals. Living off the land, as she had been taught, Luna would sometimes spend days or even weeks in the wilderness before her mother noticed she was missing and tracked her down, bringing her back home.	Always she would run away again when the cruel jokes of the other children became too much for her. Her animal friends trusted and didn't judge her. A pack of wolves became her particular favorites and she loved to emulate their behavior.	On one occasion, when she was sixteen fifteen and her taste buds were craving a boot, Luna realized that she had been with her wolf pack for over a month. Her mother had never left her that long before; she always came searching for her daughter. For the first time ever, Luna returned to her tribe of her own accord.	Upon arriving, she was told her mother had run off, screaming, during a raid and never come back. They said she had gone crazy. They said it was all Luna's fault. The tiefling was no longer welcome in the tribe.	Gathering her few belongings, Luna left. For a time she lived with her wolf pack, but she felt a hole in her chest that the animals couldn't fill. She missed her mother and the the love she gave – however sporadic it had been. Once again, Luna gathered her belongings.	This time, she headed north, out of Gaelengard, towards the so-called “civilized” lands where rumor had it “people like her” were more accepted."9/19/2017 19:34:45,DYLAN DESOTO,Half-vampire,Gunslinger,"The deSoto men have been soldiers back at least as far as the Civil War. Dylan’s father was a Vietnam veteran, and after the war ascended to the rank of Colonel. He fathered Dylan late in life, but had high hopes for him regardless – a spot at West Point was reserved for him before he was even born. Dylan grew up marching, shooting, running, and doing pushups.It got really old. Shortly before he graduated from high school, Dylan ran away, hopping a bus from his nice home in Arlington to Miami, intending to work a freighter to some sun-drenched Caribbean island. He found a freighter, all right, but it turns out that the Jamaicans who owned the boat weren’t running rum, they were trafficking people – to the Vampire Court. Long story short, Dylan was infected, escaped with the help of Jessica Olmstead, and has been a drifter ever since. His fight to retain the most basic parts of his humanity have recently been aided by a big biker named Maggie, who took him in and is slowly teaching him the trade of motorcycle repair, and the Zen that goes with it."9/19/2017 19:35:37,SGT. ERIC BRUCE LEE,Human,Police Officer,"Sergeant Eric Bruce Lee is a Golden Gate Park bike cop, one of the best. In his early 40's, he's in better shape than most people in their 20's. Ripped, tan, and efficient, he patrols the whole of the largest park in San Francisco from the seat of his beat-up old mountain bike. A devoted Buddhist, Sgt. Lee has an uncanny knack for knowing when and where to show up to prevent problems from escalating.He's of no relation to the more famous East Bay resident Bruce Lee, but his dad was a big fan, and Sgt. Lee is also a dedicated martial artist.Eric is pretty clued into the weird these days; the saddlebags on his bike have a flask of holy water, a cold-forged iron knife, and shaker of powdered garlic. If anyone asks, he says the garlic's for pizza. The soy-cheese, gluten-free, vegan organic fair trade pizza.But all that knowledge has come at a price – it’s shaken the root of his faith. He doesn’t know how to fit inhuman monsters into the cycle of birth and rebirth, and it’s not something he can talk about with just any monk at the temple. He’s been working through the frustration by competing in long-distance bike rides and triathlons."9/19/2017 19:36:33,GUY JACOBSON,Human,Garbage Mage,"Guy Jacobson is a garbage man.

He’s been working the job for about 25 years. Guy’s a good union man, makes a decent living, goes home to his wife and kids in Alameda. He’s the treasurer of the Alameda Rotary Club lunchtime chapter.And he’s got a secret. A big one. When he touches things, sometimes, he gets a vision about ‘em. Where they been, what they done. And one time, he picked up this big old book outside this fancy house in the Sunset, and whoo-wee! The things that book told him! Ever since then, he’s been tinkering in his garage with other things like that big book, some crystals he found, other stuff he picked up on his routes. You’d be surprised, the stuff these City rich folks’ll toss. His wife, Jolene, thinks it’s a mid-life crisis, these things he’s makin’. He even gave her one, a necklace, made her promise to not take it off. Guy’s pretty sure it will protect her from gangbangers.And then he saw some stuff he can’t forget. Bodies, missing parts. Dudes who don’t look like dudes, but like movie monsters. Dumpsters with holes punched clear through ‘em. He tried explaining the dumpsters to Joseph, his super, but that white boy just looked at Guy like he was nuts. That made Guy think… there’s some crazy out there, and somebody oughta do something ‘bout it. Somebody like him, maybe. Just don’ tell Jolene."9/19/2017 19:38:11,JESSIE OLMSTEAD,Were-serpent,Eco-terrorist,"Jessica was a pretty typical middle-class kid from Minnesota.  She liked exploring the forest near her home, got good grades, fell in love with her high school boyfriend, dumped him to go to college. She majored in environmental studies, marched in some protests, researched food safety and the environmental impact of GMOs and pesticides, got a big tattoo of a snake eating its tail on her back. The tattoo supposedly symbolized the constant cycle of life and death, the recreation of what was destroyed, the endlessness of the universe.Grad school took her to Guyana, where she was recruited into an eco-activist organization. What started as a simple protest group rapidly radicalized, with their agenda becoming more and more extreme. Towards the end of her first semester, she participated in an infiltration to sabotage corporate equipment that was illegally clear-cutting the rain forest to plant more crops.That’s where things went wrong. Injured by a rent-a-cop with a machete, she wound up getting separated from her group.  A couple delirious days in the jungle later, she awoke to a firm hand washing her wound, in what appeared to be a thatch-roof hut. This was a turning point in her life, as the woman – a shaman of some sort – recognized in Jessica something she herself never knew. She said the tattoo – done in a cheap college town piercing shop when Jessie was 19 and drunk – was a sign from the gods. Jessica’s a shapeshifter, a were-snake. They spent several weeks working to tap and refine her abilities, and then the shaman (Jessica never did get her name) returned her to Georgetown.Her contacts in the protest group welcomed her back, and introduced her to Dylan – an escapee from a human trafficking ring. They quickly became friends, and agreed that they would return and gather evidence to motivate the Guyanan police to take down the trafficking ring. When this plan, too, went south, Jessica and Dylan were forced to intervene directly. Though she had planned to keep her abilities to herself, Dylan now knows about her shapeshifting, and she knows of his darker nature as well."9/19/2017 19:39:23,Frank,Imaginary Friend,Imaginary Friend,"Nobody quite knows what to make of Frank. He’s a big guy, bald, kinda mushy looking, like Mr. Clean, after a few years of retirement. He just sort of showed up one day at Marla’s Place and started helping out, moving boxes, sweeping, putting stuff on shelves. He’s pretty naïve, doesn’t talk much, doesn’t eat much either.  But he seems interested in things, and always has a smile for people.The truth is, Frank isn’t real. He’s a construct, born of the fever dreams of one Julie Wilder. Julie’s a 13-year-old coma patient at UCSF’s long-term medical care facility. She’s completely unresponsive to normal stimuli, but her EEG nevertheless shows massive brain activity. The doctors surmise she’s invented her own world and is living in a dream state.  They’re only partially wrong.Had it not been for the accident, Julie would have been a wizard – might still be someday, if that wizard healing is all it’s cracked up to be.  For now, though, she experiences the world as a dream, through the eyes of Frank. Since Frank’s just a construct, he isn’t terribly bright, but he’s strong and tough and pretty fearless. He’s sort of a cross between Baymax and Fezzik the Giant.  If he takes a liking to you, he’ll go to the ends of the earth to protect you. Or, he may just follow you around like a puppy."9/19/2017 19:44:44,Caliban RedLeaf,Elf,Wizard/Elementalist (fire),"As it has so often before, the door to the tavern swings open, another weary traveler straggling in late from a long day of travel.  Normally, this garners nothing but grumbling from for letting the heat out and the snow in.  This time is different, though, for the breeze that precedes the latest arrival into the dimly lit common room smells of autumn, not of dead winter.  From beneath the hood of a cloak streaked scarlet and orange, two eyes, full of pain, reflect the light of the tavern’s fire – or perhaps the fire burns from inside.  A hand, too warm for flesh, clutches tightly a red staff, in the shape of a dragon rampant, breathing a quite whisper of flame, wavering in the draft.	The stranger sets his pack, clanking and sloshing, down with the others at the door.  A quiet, raspy voice whispers, “A seat by the fire, a glass of sherry, and a room for the night, barkeep.”  For all that he speaks quietly, the voice seems to cut the air of the room like a knife.  As he steps into the room, the snow falls away from his boots as though repelled, and he leaves no footprints.  Caliban's obsession with fire began at the same time he became an orphan.  As an elfling, Christian RedLeaf discovered his father's tinderbox.  Like many children, he played with it, thinking it a toy.  His curiosity and innocence were to have disastrous consequences, as a spark from the tinderbox landed in his mother's forgotten glass of sherry.  It ignited, taking the lace curtains it was placed under with it.  Soon, the whole house was ablaze.  The family panicked, and his father, a roofer who dealt with tar for a living, was set ablaze by a brush with the curtains.  Still on fire, he lifted young Christian by the throat and threw him out the window, giving him the burn scar that adorns his throat and voice to this day.  The fire was put out by the Brotherhood of the Volcano, a local sect of fire warlocks, but not before consuming Christian's family and all of their belongings.  The kindly Brothers adopted the dazed and battered elfling, raising him to be one of them.  He turned out to be one of the most talented of their apprentices.  His natural intelligence served him well, but even more important was the fact that his earlier trauma had apparently attuned him to the element of fire in a deeper and more powerful way than anyone could have imagined.  However, along with this power came a deep sense of guilt for his family's deaths.  His aura, formerly bright and clear, slowly came to resemble the smoky flames of a funeral pyre. Eventually, he left the Brotherhood, dissatisfied with their inability, and his own, to cleanse him of his guilt.	RedLeaf wandered the world for a while, seeking to find some way to absolve his grief.  One autumn evening, drunk on cheap moonshine, and with a desire to make his exterior person resemble his soul, he commissioned a tattoo that would disfigure his face and ride his back the way his guilt rode his heart.  The result is both beautiful and hideous to behold, a Red Dragon poised to devour his right eye. The neck of the Dragon wraps around the scar on his throat to his back, where the main body of the Dragon is drawn.  The claws of the Dragon actually appear to be digging into the flesh and bone of his back as they perch on his lowest rib. The wings are stretched across his shoulders onto his upper arms, and finally, the tail of the dragon wraps underneath his left arm, ending at a point over his breastbone.  The tuft of the tail is a flame, poised over his heart.  Upon the completion of the tattoo, Christian took a new name for himself, choosing to be called simply, “Caliban”, the name of a mad demon elf, drawn from forgotten literature.	His search has led him now to Tolerance, home to many things... Including the ancient sect of the Fire Dancers.  With the last remnants of hope in his tortured heart, he has joined their dance, with the desire for absolution or oblivion, whichever comes first."9/19/2017 19:49:25,Elijah Copperpot,Gnome,Wizard,"I am Elijah, son of Copperpot, son of Quartus, son of UzalElijah the Tinker, Elijah the Fey-touched, Elijah the GnomeBorn to light in the house of Timeus ap Dailen,Child of lost Kerniw, Tribesman to the Aidan.I have Traveled many leagues and walked in many realms,Learned the way of the sword and the tomeI have had a manticore at my mercyExacted my people’s revenge on the goblin tribesThe door to the Dark Temple of the Sacred SpringFell before my righteous command.I solved the riddle of Riddarch’s TombAnd wield a sword forged by his hammer.I have seen sunset in the Summerlands, And I wear a faerie mark upon my brow,And with the Summerwalkers, I have seen the face of warAnd won much glory at Cenarth Ford.I am Elijah the Tinker.I am Elijah, the Fey-touched.I am Elijah ap Copperpot.I am Elijah, son of Copperpot, Son of Quartus, Son of UzalElijah the Tinker, Elijah the Fey-touched, Elijah the GnomeBorn to light in the house of Timeus ap Dailen,Child of lost Kerniw, Tribesman to the Aidan.I have Traveled many leagues and walked in many realms,And I have learned many things:	At my father’s hearth, I learned a craft	In my travels, I learned the way of the sword	At the hands of the goblins, I learned revenge	For the Manticore, I learned to be merciful	At the Sacred Spring, I learned righteousness	At Riddarch’s Tomb, I learned to be clever	In the Summerlands, I learned the way of the tome	From Duke Gryffudd ap Nudd, I learned gratitude	And at Y Gryd ym Cenarth Rhyd, I learned the meaning of glory.Fear me, for I know more than you thought possible."9/19/2017 19:52:58,Garbo the Unpleasant,Garbageman,Rogue,"After Garbo’s garbage truck was struck by the blast of a hateful wizard, he was fused with trash.

He sings everything from High Masses to bawdy tavern tunes with equal skill, often incorporating original compositions into his performances.Attire:•	General Notes: Jericho’s attire varies depending on the situation, but he is never to be seen without his holy symbol, a beautifully made silver and gold sunburst. He typically wears the deep blues and gold of his order, even if not formally dressed.•	Day-to-day wear: Jericho dresses in that intentionally sloppy style that has captivated women for millennia, favoring linen shirts, usually white, with a deep blue over-tunic. He typically wears his long hair tied back in a ponytail, and carries one or two books or stacks of sheet music.•	Formal wear: When circumstances require formal wear, Jericho breaks out the ceremonial robes of his order – deep blue and flowing, with gold accents and a prominently displayed holy symbol. During these occasions, his aura and his sunburst glow with particular prominence.•	Adventuring: When in dangerous situations, Jericho usually wears a mithril chain shirt and wool leggings, with high leather boots. A barely used mace hangs off his belt, and his holy symbol is in hand at all times. He also wears a flat necklace of very ancient design fitted tightly around his neck, and black leather bracers tooled in a Celtic knot style pattern. •	Carousing: Jericho’s tavern wear is much like his daily wear, with a few exceptions. Most noticeable is the mandolin, which, though well worn, is still a beautiful instrument with a tone equal to his voice.  He frequently wears an armband signifying him as a member of the Guild of Mask and Scroll, and his hair is usually worn down. So as not to draw the wrong kind of attention in these situations, he typically wills his aura into darkness."9/19/2017 20:33:15,Azven Shavant,Human,Sorcerer ,"The Man in Black, harbinger for the Demon of Dragons, aspect of the end time, tore a small tear in realities separating the positive and negative energy planes to allow himself to slip through from the dimension his true self was trapped in. It caused a ripple effect. The positive and negative energy planes reverberated against the cellular structures of several fetuses still in development at the time. Two happened to be in a perfect stage to cause powerful mutations. Azven was one of them. He had been gifted powers beyond his understanding. Limbs that could stretch, internal physiology that seemed to change from moment to moment, the ability to expel acid from his fingertips. He grew up sequestered in an academy for those with innate magical abilities, but his methods of study took a mindset of the amoral and had a tendency to lose the sight of right and wrong on a small scale to what would logically serve humanity best on the whole. This led him to be exiled, never knowing the secrets of his birth, to the new continent, so that he could go and be someone else's problem.

It briefly revealed her true nature and at the same time forced her apprentice, who was hiding listening, back into the cat she had been before a goddess made her wish come true. Thistle thought her apprentice ran away and doesn't understand why she is stuck with this always pissed off black cat until one day she starts to understand it and realises she is at fault and needs to fix it"9/19/2017 21:00:05,Fiore Ghufran,Tiefling,Fighter,"An orphan abandoned to the sewers to die, Fiore was found by a curious wizard who took them for some sort of unidentified monster. Upon discovering that they were intelligent, he did his best to raise the strange child. Fiore grew up shy, socially awkward, and bookish. However, they were also idealistic and a romantic at heart. Fiore craves friendship and acceptance from those around them and is a fearless ally despite their personal insecurity.

In her earlier days, she was an adventurer of modest means. One good score, hitting it off with the party sorcerer, and unexpected pregnancy lead to an early retirement. Pepper and her husband used their earnings to open a jewelry shop to fund their family life. Three kids and middle aged spread later, she found herself getting the itch to go be an axe for adventure again and she set out to top up her coffers for retirement. Even though she's a bit slower and thicker than most people she runs with, her mom senses are finely tuned and allow her to readily get to the root of problems. "9/19/2017 21:54:32,Denegar Pyral,Half-elf,Bard,"Denegar was born in the Pyrt Enclave to an Elven woman named Alyra. He never met his father, a brief visitor to the Enclave who wooed his mother. He only ever heard whispers and murmurs that the man was a con artist. Denegar never asked his mother about the man; he never cared. What bothered him was the condescension from other acolytes. He was constantly told he would never amount to anything. Though his mother was a powerful mage, little was expected of him. And after a certain point, he stopped caring.While he practiced magic and studied, he did so lazily or not at all. Most often, he could be found trying to trick younger acolytes. He used a mixture of magic and plain charm to convince the younger children of the value of random trinkets he had obtained. When he was discovered the first time, he used that same charm to slip away with a warning. When he was caught a second time, the Teacher who caught him was less forgiving. She wanted him punished severely for his misconduct. In a stroke of luck, he manifested a powerful illusion which held her attention long enough for him to slip away. This time, he knew he had to leave the Enclave. He grabbed his pack and instrument from his quarters and left a note for his mother. Denegar made it to the docks and convinced a merchant ship to let him board as a performer. Much like his other studies, he had neglected practicing his instrument, so he found himself playing catch up at a pace that was nothing less than terrifying. He managed to stumble his way through enough performances to make it to Jisha. The ship only briefly stopped there to resupply. It was also enough time for Denegar to acquire a ring from one of the Tabaxi. It was then that he conceived his greatest con; Duke Martin Guerre.As the vessel sailed towards Obrar, he began fabricating the tale of a Duke who had been denied his heritage. He knew that faking the position of a landed noble would be impossible, but he might be able to pull this off. As soon as they arrived on the shores of Obrar, he set to work. In smaller towns outside of Quereth, he is known as Martin Guerre. He only arrived in Quereth recently and is looking for ways to increase his wealth and status so that he can increase the image of Martin Guerre, the disgraced duke."9/19/2017 22:16:13,Boggart,Half-orc,Fighter,"His mother abandoned him at a young age, Boggart was forced to live off the land until he was picked up by a group of outlaws. They liked how he was a small size (being a child) and that he could get into places an adult couldn't. He was raised with the outlaws and became a strong-arm for them as he grew older into his part-orc body.Eventually he started questioning the ways of the outlaws and had a difference of opinion. He left the outlaw group to join a mercenary band, doing legal work for legal pay.The mercenary group eventually disbanded, leaving Boggart to find his own way as muscle-for-hire to anyone that could afford his special set of skills."9/19/2017 22:31:29,Gnarbo,forest spirit,druid,"Gnarbo hails from a remote swamp. The forest has been ravaged by deforestation, so with the help of some environmentally conscious teenagers, they hope to gain the knowledge and resources needed to save their home. Because they come from such a wild setting, communicating with other spirits and assorted forest creatures, Gnarbo is one with nature and naive to the ways of the civilised world.

Alborin learned much from his father before his passing, reading from his textbooks and journals. He didn't acquire a taste for adventure and fighting until he left home to carry on the Orveal name of treasure hunter. He was roped into a plan to over throw an empire and then defeat a wizard, shutting a portal that would damn the Earth to the Seven Hells. A Magic Bow and Arrow was his bread and butter, precision was his middle name, and his Wings Of Flying made the most difficult of shots seem like child's play.

Rather than write historical treatises like his forebears, Brundorff is compiling a series of dwarven folk tales for public sale.  The tales all revolve around the ancient dwarven hero Macton, a trickster figure from their mythology, who drank, swindled, romanced, and fought through the Age of Wonder, ""a thousand generations ago, when dogs could talk and the last dragons fell.""  Brundorff tends to emulate this hero a little too much, especially with drinking.  He's currently persona non grata in his homeland of the Kalatian Empire, having sung a song about a local mayor that crossed the line of good taste and attracted the mayor's rage."9/19/2017 23:35:22,Usk,Half-Orc,Druid,"When the Druidic Mountain Circle stopped a vicious raid by the local Thundering Axe orc clan, they took the orc chieftain's young half-human son Usk as a hostage.  Usk took to the Druidic traditions quickly, believing fervently that Nature is holy and must be protected.A high-ranking official in the Circle accused Usk of heresy, insisting that his ""true orcish nature"" would make him a despoiler of nature.  When Usk swore revenge, his other superiors ordered him to go on a learning pilgrimage, to defuse the tension.Usk's dual nature frequently causes him distress and anguish.  While he considers himself a peacemaker and healer, he also judges himself and others by harsh, inflexible standards.  He will usually offer his enemies a single chance to surrender; if they refuse, he will attempt to destroy them no matter the risk to his own life (or those of his friends, which is a sore point).

But there will be a separate backstory generator for villains in the future.The description is kept a little vague on purpose. The aim of this generator is to give a rough idea of what a character may have gone through, while keeping out some of the key details to make sure it could fit in most story settings.This way you can use the character ideas you have to further add to the history of this generator character or vice versa.Due to the random nature of a random generator, some descriptions might be a bit odd. It's possible to have somebody look for his or her significant other while being accompanied by his or her significant other and somebody who lost his or her brothers could be accompanied by his or her brother. But perhaps that character simply doesn't know it's his or her significant other or brother yet, ooh the mystery.Some of the grammar could also be incorrect due to all the randomness. But the mistakes are mostly limited to incorrect uses of plural or singular versions.To start, simply click on the button to generate a random description. Don't like the description?

At birth, his motherflipped a coin to decide whether to eat him or not. Luckily forGorton it landed on tails.At an early age, Gorton became lost and found himself in a humanvillage. He met a barren old spinster who, longing for her ownchildren, adopted (read: stole) him and took it upon herself togive him an education. Also she was a bit crazy from the syphilis.Gorton learnt to read after being given 7 scrolls that told thefictional tale of a boy wizard. This is what started his loveaffair with magic.As he reached his teenage years, he decided to pursue a career inWizardry rather than follow in the footsteps of his long forgottenmother. Barbarianism didn't interest him.He soon adopted a toad as his familiar. Whilst trying to perform alevitation spell on the creature, he accidentally turned itinside-out. After confirming that there was still a pulse, Gortonnamed the toad Giblets, as that is what he now resembles. Gibletsoccasionally pulsates, but mostly he attracts circling crows.Most recently he has been travelling the lands, using hisrudimentary literacy skills to learn magic. He's still prettyterrible at it and is prone to rage fits when his spells don'twork.Because he can't grow his own facial hair due to poor geneticsfrom his father's side, Gorton wears a fake beard to make himselflook wiser and more magicy. His greatest fear is someonediscovering that it's actually a second-hand merkin weaved fromboar hair. He also draws a scar over his left eye, similar to theone the boy wizard from his scrolls had.

Her mother tried to shield her from the violence and rampant lawlessness, but failed early on as the young girl was groomed by recruiters from the Assassin's Guild who taught her how to shoot a bow with lethal efficiency as well as helped her tame one of the monstrous rats that roamed the severs of the city. After being ousted due to her unwillingness to engage in murder of the especially unsavory variety, she set out on her own with her riding rat Westley, seeking adventure and coin to send home for her parents' protection money fund."9/20/2017 7:04:51,Snap,pixie,rogue,"Its true, as mentioned before, that the pixies of Sear Rie(new Kingdom) only have one parent, though it is not the one who birth's them.  When they are born, it is as a floating ball of pure magic, seeking out a ""parent.""  Their Parent is an adult who wishes to take on a new Pixie, helping it to form itself.  This parent's name was Moon, or at least, that is what others called her.  She was as bright and shining as the object in the sky, a sorceress who made all around her happy.  She was overjoyed the day a new life found her,  others said the sky was even brighter that night.Moon taught little ""Fer""(Magic) all about the world and the life in it.  Fer realized that it didn't matter if the Pixies were distant from the Queen and the Seelie kingdom, they were in the forest, and the forest was filled with life and magic.  It was as Moon was teaching Fer about the forest around them that she was taught the most important, yet cruelest lesson of all.  Magic can be useless.Moon was captured that day.  Little Fer watched helplessly as her only parent was taken away.  To be a pet?  To be bred?  To use her body to produce drugs?  Fer wonders every moment to this day.She decided to shed her name, allowing only one person of the past to say it.  She raised herself alone, not seeking another parent.  It wasn't until she was physically formed that others gave her a name.  In a cruel manner to one that snuck but could not yet fly with ease, they called her ""Snap"", the sound a branch makes when stepped on.  When she became of age, she joined two schools, the Performer School and the War College; she barely slept until she graduated from both.  It took her into adulthood, but she became a pixie rogue, signing up to take on the laws which govern the New Kingdom, patrolling the forest along with the mages.Maybe it was desire for vengeance.

He escaped into the surrounding forests, and lived a life of exile among the plants and animals, eventually earning his way into a Druidic order and acting as a protector of the wilderness. He still wears his royal cloak, but after decades of use it is now threadbare and filthy, to compliment his own personal lack of grooming.

He married the girl from the next town over at a young age, and inherited the farm when his parents passed during a particularly cold winter. With nothing but a few gold pieces in his pocket and the failing farm to his name, Tohmed was at a loss for how to be able to afford the necessities when his young wife became pregnant. A mercenary troupe was hiring in town and promised good coin, and Tohmed, naturally tall and sturdy from years of farmwork, took up the call. There he learned to fight, and to survive, and became a bit hardened to war and battle, learning of the ways of healing and of worship to the Warden, the local protection deity.When the war was over, Tohmed, afraid to admit his own fears of returning home to his wife and new daughter, stayed with the mercenary troupe even as they turned to banditry. It was only when a local chapel to the Warden was threatened, and the old cleric killed, that he turned on his fellow mercenaries, seeing the wrongs of his ways and beginning down the path of a true paladin. It was on a prison cart to trial for murder that his story began."9/20/2017 10:28:12,Marsal Sorra Sabatier,Water Genasi,Monk/Sorceror,"Early lifeBorn in a mid-sized town on the border of the inland sea, Sorra was marked as an outsider from birth. A mixture of her appearance, and a natural tendency for her to ‘snap’ and quickly become enraged, led to Sorra being rather isolated from other children. Sorra’s mother raised her alone, with no other siblings and no extended family still in contact with them.  She never knew her father – or even exactly what shade of being he was. Sorra’s mother did not talk about him when at all possible. Sorra always resented her mother, largely seeing her as to blame for her ‘condition’. Shortly after she turned 16, Sorra’s latent magical potential began to manifest, and she soon left home.TutelageSorra was picked up by a passing wise man named Chòt, who spent his years travelling from town to town with various merchant caravans. Predominantly Chòt was a medicine-man to the townsfolk, treating sickness or providing herbs in exchange for the means of scraping out a meagre living. Often, he would gather the local children and in exchange for a few coppers, teach them a lesson from among the seemingly endless depths of his memory and experience. More rarely, adults of a village might come to him for spiritual guidance, wisdom or arbitration. It was perhaps in this area most of all that he served as Sorra’s mentor.Chòt taught Sorra about her condition. About the types of being that represented who her father might be. He taught her that the elemental blood swirling within her was a challenge she was destined to overcome. Her magic, her rage – all traces of her heritage – could be overcome with rigorous application of mind and body. Sorra strove to control her wild natural state of emotions, suppressing them under layers of control. Through hard physical labour, she learnt the strength necessary to suppress what she thought of as her inner demons. In time, Chòt would come to teach her how to become closer to the pinnacle of perfection, in mind, body and spirit. Spitting in defiance of her imagined father, Sorra strove to conquer her chaotic self.With the passing years, Chòt grew older, and sickly. Several times, their travels were aborted while the old man was laid up in bed, Sorra having to balance gathering herbs and preparing remedies at his instruction, with working to earn food and board for the two while he rested at an inn. True to his dedication to a physical ideal, though, whenever his health looked on the mend Chòt would pack up and press on, heading back to the beaten trail.House BlackvyneIt was during this time, that Chòt was called upon by Lord Blackvyne, while traversing the realms of his Duchy. The Lord’s own coterie of astrologers, clairvoyants and other knowledgeable courtiers was inaccurate, or could not be trusted, or too personally involved – Sorra never really found out why the Lord came to her mentor. Neither did she know what matter of spiritual or moral council he sought; later, she came to suspect that it had to do with Lord Blackvyne’s place in the broiling politics that was shortly to erupt into war. Whatever it was, Blackvyne was most gracious to Chòt afterwards, but instead of accepting payment the old man simply asked the duke to take Sorra on as an advisor. The road was becoming ever more dangerous, and Chòt’s health ever-weaker; Sorra, now twenty-three was in the prime of her life, Chòt had told her, and was ready to strike out on her own.Sorra never saw the old man again. A few weeks later, a messenger arrived from the next village along on the old man’s route, bearing news of plague. Whether he was caught in the outbreak she did not know, but it seemed likely and, given his health, she doubted Chòt could have survived. The duke himself had grown large on fat meat and good wine, and needed a change in lifestyle if he were to keep up his lifestyle of hunting. He took Sorra on as a wellbeing instructor, the young woman’s excellent knowledge of athletic discipline bringing a small ray of rejuvenation into the aging lord’s life.Even in all of her travels, Sorra had grown used to staring looks, mistrust, abuse and occasionally even physical assaults from the locals of whatever villages they passed on their travels. Before Lord Blackvyne, no-one had ever simply accepted her, seen her for the freak of nature that she was, and then taken her in anyway. Well, no one except Chòt. Blackvyne was able to look under her disfigurement and see what, in Sorra’s own mind, was the disciplined young woman whose very body spoke of her underlying mastery of physical discipline. For that, she was forever grateful to the duke, and served him as dutifully as she had her old mentor."9/20/2017 9:17:02,Goop Boi,Sword in a gelatinous cube,Sorcerer,"Once a magical sword named Cutter, it was handed down through generations of adventurers. When its owner got killed by a gelatinous cube and it was absorbed, it decided that it was done being wielded by stupid kids and was going on its own adventures. It telepathically dominated the cube and decided it wanted to learn magic, and after a year of study it set off to see the world."9/20/2017 10:29:00,Dorian,Elf,Druid,"Dorion began life in a small elvish settlement towards the north of one of the larger islands. His parents were important envoys involved in diplomatic relations between the elves and humans as well as being notable for attempting to pursue a long term peaceful relationship with the local orc bands. Due to their bust schedules Dorion spent most of his time alone, wandering the forests and other natural areas of the world. Dorion became fascinated by nature and particularly a family of brown bears living in the area, for years Dorion studied this family of bears, forsaking his chores and working life to disappear into the woods and become part of the great ecosystem. Whilst living largely in the wilderness Dorion learned to channel the power of nature, despite generally being considered a weak child Dorion learned to move with grace and lethality through the forests. However when he was but 30 years old bold orc hunting parties started frequenting the forest. After they had killed several members of his beloved bear family, a distraught Dorion marshalled the animals of the wood and lead a swift, brutal assault on the orc camp. Dorion himself slew the orc chieftain in hand to hand combat, ducking around the slow clumsy blows of his greataxe and cutting him down. Afterwards Dorion searched the camp and found a baby orc crying desperately for his parents. Dorion could not bring himself to slay the innocent child and left the baby orc outside one of the major orc encampments. Fearing how his parents would react to his blatant acts of aggression Dorion fled from the island. For many years afterwards he travelled the wild learning all he could about the natural world. Gradually he understood how rash his actions had been and that alternatives to bloodshed should always be pursued if at all possible. Dorion generally spends most of his time in the wilds, living alongside the animals of the wilds. He will occasionally rest in a village paying his way with rare flowers and trophies from animals. Whilst he has mellowed over time Dorion is still a staunch defender of the natural world and can’t abide large cities and towns which don’t somehow incorporate nature into their construction.

The tribe roamed from spot to spot, settling here and there for a time, until finally finding a home among the people far from the ancient and terrible enemy.  Aquaria has lost track of her age. She was an adult, old enough to have mated and spawned, when the tribe found the ancient city, ending their long wandering after the Atlanteans had destroyed their rocky island home during the first flush of her adulthood. She remembers her joy at meeting the Dark Brothers (or so they called the city-dwellers), the glee at learning she would finally gain her true power as a Deep One - before finally she saw the horrific blood sacrifice of the city-dwelling cult of Dagon and Hydra. She fled, in horror - but where could she go, in a sea beset by her enemies, where even her own people were no longer her friends?  She picked the Surfacers and began a long, solitary journey up the East Coast of North America - she taught herself to read their language and understand the rudiments of their culture. When she learned of a Deep One attack against a Surfacer city, she headed that way - she'd heard confused stories of a Deep One hybrid leading the invasion forces and wanted to see what had become of it. So she showed her face in Freedom City - and promptly found herself battling superheroes. After all, this was just a few months after Archevil - nobody wanted to take any chances.  She nearly died in Blackstone, the air cold and dry, her voice echoing off the walls, alone - until she heard the halting echoes of Lemurian from the Surfacer outside her cell. An early volunteer for Project Freedom, her acclimation to Surface life - to the mistrust, the prejudice, the dry air, the bad food, the aloneness, was hard, but it was better than death.  And then things got even better when she met Singularity, aka Jessie White - she'd seen the Surfacer woman in a cell near hers in Blackstone and though they hadn't spoken then, the familiarity was enough to make them roommates at Project Freedom. Aquaria wasn't scared of Jessie's strange moods and desire for solitude - and Jessie didn't mind Aquaria's strange smells and bizarre habits so much. She was the first new member of Aquaria's pod.  Now they're free and living in the DuTemps Building, where their pod has grown substantially - even including friends who swim in the Sea of Stars. It's not the same as the world she left behind, but it's a good enough world.  She'll be reunited with her Deep One brothers and sisters again - when the stars are right.

Trees shattered roads and broke buildings, killing millions in architectural collapses and road accidents across the world as thick forest growth was suddenly everywhere, passing right through man’s technological civilization. The news media, and the Freedom League, had time to track the horrific event as it happened, beginning in eastern China and stretching across the planet with the terrible fall of darkness, time to observe that the new growth matched whatever forests were native to the landscape they were devouring - but not time to stop it. In the frigid days after the catastrophe, those few places that still had power were reassured by the government and by the Freedom League that help was coming. But no help came. It was the heroes who vanished first; the superheroes and brave humans who went into the forest looking for answers. And then the others began to vanish too - humans all over the planet left behind their families, their loved ones, and simply walked into the newborn Forest Primeval. The mystery of their disappearances was solved when they returned, feral and maddened by animal impulses and predatory desires, and began attacking the surviving human communities. The war between the Children of the Forest and the survivors of the old world lasted for several years and resulted in the deaths of most of the world’s surviving superhumans and many of the survivors - there was no treaty, no negotiation, no mercy - the Ferals simply stopped coming. Gradually the survivors learned how to cope with the new world - how to forage in the cities for food and gear without being caught by the Maddening Wild (avoiding the darkness was the key), how to resist the Maddening Wild’s call (sticking together in groups was the ticket), and about the small number of people, all of them without other superpowers, who had the ability to forage in the woods _without_ being maddened by the Wild. 2015 is the fifteenth year since the world ended. Freedom City lies, broken, by an impossibly old oak and pine forest in which trees with hundreds of years worth of rings lie at the heart of the civilization they impaled. The largest population of survivors lies at the edge of the city, a few thousand hearty souls dwelling in the community around the Raymond Nuclear Power Plant at the edge of North Bay. They can go into the city to scavenge and explore, but only during daylight hours. The Maddening Wild still calls - though perhaps less forcefully than it did in the grim days at the start of the new century. The woods themselves are haunted by the past - the murdered city they devoured, and what lies within.The Ferals themselves are dangerous enough, savage, animalistic humanoids, many of them with superpowers, but they are not the worst of it. The Forest Primeval came with animals too; bears and wolves and bobcats, all the creatures once endemic to coastal New Jersey. But they came back unnatural - too clever by half, and with an intelligence that has grown unnaturally in recent years. Bears have been seen in the Deep Woods wearing human clothing, and wolves howling to each other in some grim parliament. They have shown a terrible intelligence when fighting humans - hitting men carrying flashlights to blind them in the dark, making man-like noises to lure unwary travelers, and otherwise making it clear that the forest is theirs. Many kill not to feed - but to terrify the human survivors. The Forest is full of monsters - and the Forest is everywhere.   Riley Quinn was only about two months old at the Millennium. His parents, Casey and Peyton Smith-Quinn, lived in North Bay when he was born - their home was a mansion, small by the standards of the neighborhood, but spacious enough after the relative poverty of their youths in Mississippi. Maybe because they came from poverty themselves, with a history of dealing with emergency situations, they took action promptly on that terrible night of the 31st as the news of threatening global destruction came. When the Forest Primeval hit Freedom City, they had taken shelter at the nearby Raymond Nuclear Plant where his mother worked as a plant nuclear engineer, trusting in its solid construction to save them. And it did, to an extent - the Forest devoured the plant, too, but fate, radioactivity, and maybe just good engineering kept Raymond together. An oak tree's sudden growth shattered one reactor and a scrub pine forest sent one cooling tower cascading to the Earth in a deadly shower of debris, but quick hands prevented a meltdown and even kept electricity pumping from the plant's generators. It was a natural place to send refugees in the early days before the true horror of the situation had settled in.  Riley doesn't remember much about those days, but he's heard the stories a thousand times. The way the refugees at the power plant first scavenged for food, then began growing crops in their own right in the hastily-converted greenhouses. The way desperate engineers babied a wounded power plant, keeping two of five nuclear reactors alive and producing life-giving electricity even a decade and a half after the end of the world. The way they built a school, and a chapel, and a clinic, and a hospital out of the old plant, building an outpost to human dreams in the middle of an inhuman wilderness. The days when the Ferals hit the fences almost daily. The crack of gunfire, then of melee weapons, again and again. The heroic sacrifice of Lady Liberty, who finally succumbed to infection days after her last battle with the group of Feral metahuman teenagers who had so often led attacks against the reactors, willing to poison the whole city to stop the power plant. The horrific screams from Lonely Point as what had been the populations of Bayview and Port Regal, backed by a rampaging Feral Captain Thunder broke through the defenses. His father, whose cancer could have been easily caught five years earlier, and his grave in the old plant garden. Riley is almost certain he can remember his father's voice. For various reasons, Riley grew up dissatisfied with his lot in life. He had ample reason for this, raised in a community at the edges of a world murdered by the Forest Primeval. He knew how lucky they were, especially compared to other survivor communities that lacked things like power, machine shops, and other tools providing some echo of what had once been modern life, but he also knew from his exploration of the (long-since-picked-over) homes near the Raymond site just how much they'd lost. So he dreamed, in between schoolhouse lessons and chapel prayers, between working in the greenhouse and going fishing, of the world that had been lost - and the wonders that had once been his birthright. But most of all, when he climbed the long-deserted Cooling Tower #4 and looked out at tree-skewered Freedom, he dreamed of the lost city of Freedom, and wondered what secrets lay within.  Now these were no small dreams in the Raymond community, not when once a year or so someone would zone out and be sucked into the Maddening Wild, wandering into the Forest Primeval to either be eaten by animals or join the Ferals. So he kept them to himself as he got older, instead learning his mother's engineering skills with the idea of one day taking her place managing the reactors. But boys will be boys - by day he read technical manuals and worked in the machine shop, and by night he studied old city maps and the notes of those few explorers who had survived the journey into Freedom Primeval. On his fifteenth birthday, he presented himself to the Security Force as a volunteer for the Woodsmen, a dangerous, but highly valued part of life in their little community given the number of things the community's technology needed to survive - and how valuable the remaining scraps of super-tech scattered through the city still were. His mother wasn't happy - but after he demonstrated his skills at climbing and hunting, at marksmanship and hiding, even she couldn't say no.  Freedom Primeval was everything he'd dreamed - beautiful and terrifying, wonderful and dangerous, marvelous and lethal. He rested in the shade of the oak trees that had split Freedom Hall in half; he battled the wolf colony that had taken over lost Lincoln. He fought a desperate battle against the Feral pack in Bayview; he prayed beneath the pine tree cathedral in St. Sebastian's Church. From his fellow Woodsmen, he learned how to sneak and survive in the city, how to hunt and fish to keep himself alive (skills he'd already begun to learn in Raymond), and how to navigate the ruined metropolis. He also learned how to kill - building his own crossbow, he was able to fend off attacks from bears, wolves, and other of the too-clever, too-wise beasts roaming Freedom City. And the unclever beasts too - the savage, cannibalistic Ferals who might once have been people. It was grim work; but it was war. No - it was survival.  At the beginning of summer, 2015, Riley joined his fellow Woodsmen on an especially dangerous mission - a scrounging run into the heart of the Goodman Building, loaded with vital super-technology that, suitably adapted as spare parts, could potentially keep the Raymond reactors running for another decade and a half. But the risk was great. The Atom children had survived the Forest Primeval, though tree damage had eventually destroyed their grandfather's systems - but become a particularly bloodthirsty pack of Ferals. But the risk was greater than the Woodsmen knew - the Atom pack had, by whatever inhuman, unholy means, _bred_ - and a pack of Feral, superpowered younglings waited inside the tree-ruined building to greet them. Separated from the rest and trying to tune out the screams of horror he heard from his fellows, Riley ran. Fleeing down a darkened, overgrown emergency stair, he found his way blocked and so ducked inside what turned out to be a long-abandoned, nearly pristine research laboratory.  Fascinated by the discovery, Riley locked the doors behind him and wandered through what had once been Alexander Atom's sanctum sanctorum. He was particularly fascinated by one particular piece of technology; a big, circular, open disc mounted in the middle of the room - one that he realized with some shock still was powered up! Succumbing to temptation, he pressed a few buttons, bringing the big machine to life with a whine of long-dead circuits and the sudden sound of alarms! At the sound of fists pounding on the door he'd locked behind him and against the inhuman shrieks outside, Riley hefted his crossbow and dived through the hole to take up a firing position on the other side.  Except he found himself somewhere else entirely.  The Goodman Building had seen its share of dimensional refugees before and while Riley (or 'Woodsman' as he called himself initially, with vague memories of watching some old war movies on the projector in his school) was different than others, there was nothing particularly alien about him compared to some of the visitors they'd seen. He was kept in isolation for nearly two weeks, both to make sure he was no longer violent (he had made free use of his crossbow to try and escape the populated, brightly-lit, tree-free laboratory he'd stumbled into) and to make sure that whatever mysterious disaster had beset his homeworld wouldn't be coming with him. But nobody had any answers - consultants like Phantom and Harrier were unfamiliar with either the timeline he described or the kind of apocalypse that had destroyed his world's native civilization, and something seemed to make it impossible to return him to his homeworld. All attempts to trace the dimensional line that he carried with him led to tangled snarls along the generally smooth course of the Cosmic Coil.  Being unable to go home was hard. He knew his mother, his fellow Woodsmen, and his people would think he was dead - devoured by the Atom pack. And how strange it was to see them, alive and well, in a healthy, thriving city full of living human beings! As much as he missed home, he loved this place. He avidly read every book he could get his hands on and (once he learned how to use modern computers) and soon found himself taking online high school classes to keep up. He was behind in a lot of areas, but not too far behind - and determined to make up for lost ground as soon as possible. If he couldn't go home yet, and if even this world full of living cities and heroes had no answers for him, he could at least make himself better here. Once he was out of isolation, he could even go to the building's gym, where he kept himself in shape by exercise and drill, determined not to lose a step when he made it back home.  Riley was so focused on learning about Earth-Prime that he barely noticed when it was time to move out. He was shocked by the thought; where could he possibly go? But then his counselor told him remarkable news - news that in retrospect he could immediately have expected. On this world, Riley Smith and his mother Peyton lived in their North Bay mansion just as they always had after his father had divorced his mother six years earlier. (And what a strange thought that was!) And that other Peyton, upon learning that a dimension-lost version of her son was in Freedom City, had thrown open her doors to that other Riley.  They talked by email, then by phone, Riley a little surprised by his counterpart's voice - had he been born different in this universe? Riley and Riley met in one of the Goodman Building's rec rooms - Riley was reading a book while his counterpart, noticeably taller and heavier, entered the room, his sharp suit a contrast to Riley's flannel shirt, windbreaker, and jeans - all of them clothes he'd taken with him from his own planet. Riley met the eyes of his counterpart, saw his mustache and goatee, heard his deep-voiced, tentative greeting, and despite himself blurted out a question that, months later, still embarrasses him.  ""Jesus! How did you grow a mustache?!"" Riley had read about his condition in pre-Millennium books, of course - in the old days, men born with women's bodies had treated themselves with testosterone, the male hormone. But synthetic testosterone was out of reach of Raymond's medical facilities (an expanded version of the old plant's emergency clinic) and crystallizing it from other men was an idea that made him nervous. So he'd resigned himself to a lifetime of bulky clothing over tight bindings, and probably never getting so much as a girlfriend, much less getting married. But in the Prime reality, the chemicals were readily available - with a doctor's prescription, anyway. His double had come out to his parents at the age of 12 and had been transitioning (a whole new word!) ever since - and had been on hormones for years. This really was, he decided the first time he took a hormone shot, a wonderful dimension.  But of course it wasn't as easy as that. The two Rileys sharing a room was not the same as having a sibling; it was like having a shadow, and an alien one, at that. Riley-Prime was a smart kid on the school academic challenge team, a member of the Gay-Straight Alliance on campus and a future nuclear engineer. The other Riley was restless and angular, sleeping on the floor or a rope hammock, roaming the rooftops by night and converting the basement into a lab to rebuild his crossbow. One Riley had lost his beloved father to cancer and an early grave; the other Riley had lost his father to divorce when he was in his early teens. (It had been acrimonious - Casey hardly saw his family anymore) Competing for a mother's love, both of them young men going through changes, they clashed - and finally they fought. Healthy and strong though he was, Riley-Prime was no trained fighter; and the Riley from offworld hadn't learned to pull his punches.  The loss of his temper, the feeling of boiling, surging rage, and the look on Peyton's face all came together to make Riley feel for a frightening moment like he'd gone Feral - like he was the barbarian his counterpart had accused him of being. He grabbed his crossbow and jumped out his window, vanishing into the North Bay night over the alien sound of arriving sirens. Running away from the angry, frightened reflection of his mother, Riley roamed the city for four days, scrounging to survive and even stealing a dose of synthetic testosterone, before Bowman tracked him down and gave him two pieces of news. One was that his mother, and even his counterpart, had forgiven him - his counterpart had even reluctantly admitted to provoking him into the fight, even though Riley was pretty sure that had been all him. The other piece of news came from Bowman himself. He'd tracked Riley through the city and been impressed by his stealth and ability to survive - and had helped clean up after Riley had used some well-placed speciality crossbow bolts to take down a gang who'd been harassing homeless kids by the airport. Bowman couldn't help Riley figure out where he fit in on Earth-Prime, but he could make a suggestion - there was this school Bowman himself had graduated from..."9/20/2017 12:33:46,Comrade Frost,Vampire,Sorcerer - sort of ,"orn in a small town outside Moscow in 1913, Dimitri Peshkov was not an attractive man in life. A bright student, he grew up lazy and a little jaded, convinced of his own intellectual superiority over his fellow students in high school and college. He became a veterinarian, tending to the animals in collective farms, out of a mild interest in helping those less fortunate but mostly for the chance to be the smartest and best-educated man in the room. When war threatened his country in 1941, he joined the NKVD, not the Red Army, not out of a special patriotism, but because he thought it would keep him away from the battlefield. He was wrong; and that would be the death of him. The old Dr. Dimitri Peshkov died beneath the sacrificial blade of the Thule Society in the spring of 1942. The NKVD doctor had been captured on the Arctic front during the defense of Murmansk and had, under the Commissar Decree, been handed over by the Wehrmacht to the SS for execution. He might simply have been shot, but a passing group of Thule mystics needed him for a special task. Operating in the far north under Kantor's commnd, the Thule circle had found an ancient Norse altar, consecrated to Hel and her father Loki, and had learned they needed human blood to open the gateway to another world. And so they did. But as Peshkov fell into darkness, a voice came to him. The life-long atheist found himself floating before Hel, the guardian of Niflheim and ruler of the Norse underworld, one of the first new arrivals in her realm in a long time. Hel explained to Peshkov, as one would to a child, that she could not be summoned to Earth by such powers the Nazis had. In the heart of the greatest war the world had ever known, Death already stalked the land, and no wizard could hope to control it. But she had seen the capture of her haughty uncle Donar, and knew the plans of the Thule Society for the world of men, and she loathed them for the blasphemers they were. So she offered Peshkov a choice. He was a descendent of Rurik and had died at the hands of her enemies; if he stayed in Niflheim in her palace, he could have a place at her side to tell her about the world above, and perhaps as master of those few Thule sorcerors who had fallen into her hands when they had died of disease or accident after taking up the worship of the Asgardians. Or he could walk the Earth again as a draugr, a being of great power and might, with the heart taken from him by the Nazis replaced by a gateway to the icy realm of Niflheim. Given the choice, Peshkov chose to live. If you could call it living. Dimitri awoke on the altar and froze his captors solid, burning their shrine down behind him and feeding on the heat within as he began the long, painful walk back to Soviet lines. He learned how to control his powers and feed from the heat of the sun, from burning fires and life's heat rather than life's blood, and when he arrived back among his own people (and immediately, wonderfully, was plunged into a hot bath...that he immediately froze solid), Dimitri Peshkov was ready to begin his new identity: Comrade Frost, costumed defender of the Soviet Union! But of course it wasn't that easy. Dimitri was the only one of his allies familiar with magic, something which his own government denied the existence of. Comrade Frost rapidly became the Peoples' Heroes' magic expert, a role he had to play very subtly. He took every chance he could to team up with the Allies of Freedom and the Liberty League, desperately trying to pool his resources with those better-connected and better-educated in these matters as he tried to stave off the threat of magical darkness at home. And there was the war, grim and terrible. Comrade Frost was one of the first Soviet super soldiers into Berlin, and was there for the last great convulsion of the Reich.His superiors denied his request to join the hunt for Kantor, and so he wasn't there when the Allies of Freedom were betrayed and murdered by the forces of darkness. It was a hard blow for the super-soldier and he slipped into a deep depression after the war. Only a battle against the snake-cultists of Lithuania roused him from his funk in 1948, the mystic-trained hero recognizing the cultists of Yig for what they were! If the cultists of the Unspeakable One and his dread allies had come to the Soviet Union, there were urgent matters to deal with indeed. His war wasn't over. Comrade Frost was not one of the better-known Soviet super-soldiers to the general public; he was just there in the various engagements with American heroes, German holdouts, Baba Yaga, and the other famous battles of the Peoples' Heroes but he was well-known to superheroes. Sometimes he was an enemy to mystic heroes in the United States and elsewhere, stealing mystic artifacts out from under their noses for the Soviet Union's use but for the most part he was an ally: a fellow enemy of darkness who could always recognize that there were threats to the universe as deadly as any nuclear missile. Briefly imprisoned in 1953, he was freed after Stalin's death. He was a busy man in the 1960s as Stalinist controls lapsed and the world of magic became more and more powerful in the Soviet Union, taking time out to fight Superior in Cuba in 1962 and war against the forces of Baba Yaga in the 1970s. Dispatched to Afghanistan in the late 1970s to help battle undead warriors summoned to life there by Muslim clerics, Peshkov was horrified at the violence and pointless waste of yet another war; when he returned home in the 1980s, he let others take over his role as magical champion while working to support Gorbachev's reforms. With the fall of the Soviet Union, Peshkov resumed his work as a defender of the world against magical threats, for the first time working regularly in countries besides the land of his birth now that he was free to travel. There was a whole world out there! Peshkov is currently assigned to Freedom City to act as the liaison between the Peoples' Heroes and the Freedom League, as well as deal with the worrisome reports he's heard about magical activity in Freedom City. Barriers he helped erect many, many years ago now are beginning to melt."9/20/2017 12:53:05,Butch deadlift ,Dwarf,Barbarian ,"Butch' parents always wanted him to be strong and use his skill in the ring and by being muscle for hire to make them money, but he hated hurting people, so he ran away as a teen, and found an elf getting beaten up, and he defended her, and now he's a protector. "9/20/2017 12:59:12,Zephyra Morose,Human,Wizard,"Once a minor mage in the Althori Empire, Zephyra was sent as part of an expedition to an dead lich's lair. Unfortunately, his traps and minions still proved effective, and she found herself the only survivor to reach the treasure room. Even worse, she looked upon a Mirror of Life-Trapping within and found herself locked in an extra-dimensional cell. After what seemed like an eternity of waiting, enough things were trapped within that she was released from her prison. Desperately, she ran out of the now empty treasure room, and found that the world outside was no longer the one she knew."9/20/2017 13:01:42,Imriel Meiji,Half-elf,Bard,"Imriel was the product of a union between Uriel, the head of a clan in the strict caste-based society of the Empire, and Jhessail, a travelling musician from the neighbouring kingdom of Kirisu. As a half elf (which made him an abomination in the eyes of the Empire) and illegitimate child, he was ineligible to inherit his father's title despite being the eldest child. This was a source of some bitterness for Imriel and soured his relationship with his father and younger brother, Michael. However, he was close with his sister Clariel. With the majority of the Meiji court refusing to see Imriel as anything other than an upstart, he began looking for ways to prove himself worthy of his family name. That was how he hit upon the idea of spying on a rival clan's heir, Lord Arai. He got himself a job as Ensign on the ""Seraph's Grace"", the ship in charge of taking Lord Arai on a tour around the Kirisu islands. When the ship was attacked, he decided to save Lord Arai to gain his trust and it was then that he met the rest of his fellow adventurers."9/20/2017 13:05:49,Sif Koboldsbane,Human,Cleric,"Abandoned at the doorstep of a temple of Torm, Sif had little idea about her parentage save for a mysterious amulet. She was raised in the temple and soon set her heart on serving Torm as a warrior, becoming deadly with a longsword and channeling Torm's power to heal her friends and smite her enemies. She loved to read stories of the heroes of old defeating dragons and other beasts of legend. When the chance came to leave the temple to go prove herself, she leapt at the chance. Setting off on a journey to Greenest with Jack, her fellow warrior of Torm, her focus was on spreading Torm's gospel and defending the weak."9/20/2017 13:12:09,Cal Warden,Human,Cleric,"     Cal Tinnel was a cleric of Pelor the god of light and was loosely related to the Archbishop of his order (second cousin once removed). For this reason, though, he found favor in the eyes of the archbishop receiving perceived preferential treatment and his companionship.      This upset the rest of the order but things only got worse when the Archbishop fell mortally ill. On his deathbed, the Archbishop proclaimed that his successor would be Cal, which sparked an uproar from the rest of the older and perhaps wiser priests, particularly a longstanding priest named Gnoland.      Gnoland set out to find some sort of scandal or dark secret or anything to pin against Cal to show him unfit to be archbishop. Cal was aware of Gnoland’s plot but was confident that he was safe.      After months of fruitless searching and with Cal's inauguration nearing Gnoland sought one of Cal's closest friends, Lea Argelle, and promised him a high position in their order if he could divulge any damning evidence against Cal. Lea caved to his greed and shared that Cal had a lover, Wyn. While it was against the law of their order to take a wife, nothing legally stopped the priests from getting physical needs taken care of from time to time. Lea urged though that this was not a simple harlot but was like a wife to him. Gnoland knew that he would not be able to use this info directly to incriminate Cal but he planned to use her as leverage.      He and his guards set off to her location, as divulged by Lea, to take her into custody. This was not as easy a task as Gnoland had initially presumed, as Wyn was a seasoned adventurer before settling down after having met Cal. She killed two of the guards and wounded Gnoland before he ordered his remaining four men to kill her rather than capture her. She was the more skilled combatant but she was outnumbered and thus she was slain. Gnoland ordered his men to take care of the fallen guards and leave no evidence of their involvement making it look like it must have been outlaws that had murdered her.      When Cal heard that Lea had been consorting with Gnoland he rushed home only to find his love dead on the floor. He used all the healing magic he could but she was already gone. Knowing there was nothing he could do in his current state; Cal forsook his faith with Pelor and begged Wee Jas a goddess of death to bestow her power to him in an attempt to bring her back from the dead. Cal felt a new, darker power flow through his being. He cast aside his old holy symbol and etched the flaming skull of Wee Jas onto his ring that he wore to symbolize his love to Wyn. He cast his ritual to the extent of his ability but nothing happened.      Distraught, Cal thought his spell had failed but then Wyn started to move. As she stood up Cal was overjoyed! However, that soon turned to horror as he realized that this was not his love. Wyn’s body was moving but her spirit was not with her. The soulless husk of Wyn’s body groaned as it struggled to stay upright. Its dark eyes surveyed the dark room until it saw Cal; all of a sudden, it lurched violently towards him letting out an unearthly screech.      Cal resited the attack and managed to find a small hand axe left behind by one of the guards. Through tears, Cal slew the revenant and once again, his lover’s motionless body lay before him.      He knew that forsaking his devotion to Pelor would be heavily frowned upon let alone consorting with necromancy. Cal had to flee the city lest he too end up dead. Gnoland had won, Lea had betrayed him, and it seemed that all was lost.      He only had one goal as he set off; he had to grow in power so that he could one day bring back Wyn’s soul and bring Gnoland’s corrupted priesthood to justice."9/20/2017 13:24:12,Jakor the Knife,Half-Orc,Rogue,"As a half-orc, Jakor was the runt of his tribe, and so was thrown into the darkness. It was here, that his ""small"" stature and his natural stealth got him ironically noticed by the assassins of Shargaas. Under their tutelage, he became an excellent assassin for the tribe, up until his tribe leader fell under the influence of a demon lord. Under this power, tanarukks were born, both empowering the tribe, and tearing it apart. In disgust by the betrayal of their chief, Jakor killed him, but the damage was done. The monsters took over the tribe, and killed the followers of the Orcish Pantheon. Jakor left, forced to wander as he lacked the power to rid his tribe of these monsters."9/20/2017 13:43:12,Vera Mil'aro,High Elf,Rogue,"Vera is one of the elvish princesses of the Summerset Forest, but has no place in the line of succession due to being a mute. Despite that, she refused to be useless, joining the Crown's Shadows, an elite group of guards and assassins with absolute loyalty to the crown, in hopes of achieving recognition despite her condition. Skilled and silent, she was looking to become an exceptional member until Duke Frost, a powerful fey spirit, assaulted the palace. With the royal family trapped in the palace, Vera was prepared to sell herself dearly alongside the rest of the Shadows, but it was not to be. Her father, in a final show of affection, ordered her to escape and live. Obligated by her orders, with tears in her eyes, she snuck past the enemy and escaped into the world, hoping to one day, if not restore her family's throne, then to avenge them."9/20/2017 13:47:18,Willa Wise,Human-presenting Aasimar,"Bard/Paladin (or what I like to call a ""pala-bard"")","Willa's story, like that of any other nobleborn, starts with her parents. Her father, Alastor Wise, is known throughout the Riordane Empire as the dear friend of the Last Emperor, having saved his life in circumstances that have been subject to the Empire's rumor mills (but does anyone know what really happened? Not really, no. Anyone who could tell you about the incident is likely dead.). Alastor, in truth, was a sculptor who believed deeply in the tenents of Yvaine, the goddess of love, and he was equally deeply in trouble when the Katalivorg family discovered their young daughter, Klara, was romantically involved with Alastor. He was just a yeoman artisan from the capital - and he was deemed ""unfit for the fate of the family"" by the Katalivorg patriarch, Adim.The Katalivorg family is known throughout Old Riordane as... questionably aligned. By no means were they darlings of the Empire or of even their own subjects. They just seemed somehow removed from the petty politics of the Empire. The Katalivorg family is cloaked in mystery and darkness, but they do wield some unnatural power. Klara grew up knowing that someday, she would be brought into the fold, but also knowing deep in her heart that she was not meant for it and was instinctually averse to becoming part of the Katalivorg legacy. Instead, she was attracted to light and beauty and good things, which eventually brought her to Alastor.Naturally, the Katalivorg's first move upon discovering this scandal was to find Alastor and have him killed by an assassin. Lucky for Alastor, Klara was an incredibly sneaky woman and she heard her family plotting her lover's demise without them even knowing. So, she packed a few things and took off into the night to find Alastor and run away with him. They came immediately to the Emperor's Palace in Abrogail to a warm welcome by the imperial family. Klara and Alastor spoke with the Emperor for many hours, and came out of the Palace in the middle of the night, now the earl and countess of what was now called ""the Wiselands,"" and swiftly transported thence under an assigned troop of tuneless bards, who were really some of the Imperial Guard.Willa was the first child of Alastor and Klara Wise, born in the spring. She was raised humbly, given a grand education befitting the leader she was born to be, and grew up loving, to varying degrees, nearly everyone she ever met. Truly, she grew to be the best of both her parents, and even threw in some personal twists of being musical, poised in moments of negotiation, and unseemingly scrappy when negotiations broke down. Naturally, when The Tear randomly appeared in the middle of the Empire leaking goblins, she went headfirst into the aptly named Goblin War. The Wise family, though fearful for their daughter's life, knew that when a calling was placed on someone, it was placed for a damn good reason. So they let her go. And how Willa thrived. She gained trusted comrades, made decisions where all the options were double-edged, grew in skill both musically and in weaponry, grew in faith as she learned to forgive what was recognized as a problem by all involved parties, and was a fighter until the end.The night the Goblin War ended with the sacking of Abrogail and the murder of the entire Imperial family sent a shock to Willa's core. She knew the people whose bodies were now on pikes outside the ruins of Abrogail, even... even loved them. She knew that she had to go back to the Wiselands then, see the castle, hold her father, kiss her mother's cheek, give her brother Omar a noogie for old time's sake. It was then that what remained of Willa's battalion separated, many returning to their homes, but a fair number remaining with Willa, for they had no homes to return to. So, Willa and her band of lost soldiers returned to the Wiselands.Upon reaching the Wiselands, Willa had noticed that everything was silent, even in the small town near the castle. When her searching, perceptive eyes saw the drawbridge of the castle down and a little wrecked, she ran. When her comrades caught up to her, they saw something they were all too used to seeing - hundreds of bodies, all on pikes, and one person standing in the middle of the carnage, their very own Willa Wise. Unlike the other times, though, Willa was not weeping - she was still, unresponsive, emotionless, staring at the body of a man. It took a very long time for her to respond to their question of ""Who is this?"" All she managed was a small, ""Dad,"" before an unnatural cry, seemingly ripped from her very soul, came out of her mouth and she collapsed at the dangling feet of her father and sobbed for so long. Her fellows carried her kicking and screaming from the castle when they saw soldiers dressed in black armor coming from beyond, carrying the banner of none other than the Katalivorg family.As they reached the forests beyond the farmlands around the castle, Willa had quieted, looking back at the castle with puffy, red eyes. Her fellows set her down, and immediately, she walked deeper into the forest. Her companions did not follow her. They knew she had things to think on.And think she did.As the night set in and she wandered the forest she had played in as a child, she came to a small clearing where the stars were so clear in the sky. She looked up, and after many silent minutes into her stargazing, she asked, ""What will I do, Yvaine? I am so... lost."" All of a sudden, a great bevy of stars began shooting across the night sky, her very body began glowing as brightly as a star, itself, and then, just before the light became too much for her mind to handle, a voice, feminine, soft, gentle, yet firm resounded around her, ""You will fight, as you were born to do, Willa Wise."" Then, she passed out. She awoke, as the sun just began to peak over the horizon, to someone's face nearly filling her eyesight. As she focused, she gasped as her heart began to fly.It was Omar.She began to laugh and cry with her dear brother whom she had feared lost forever. She held him, kissed his cheek - hell, she even gave him a noogie for old time's sake. Omar told her of the attack on the castle, how he was interrupted from his studies by their mother, how on their way to the kitchen, a bunch of goblins intercepted them and took Klara howling to her son to ""RUN!"", how the kitchen staff brandished their butcher's knives and rollers, meat hammers and pokers and defended him from the intruding horde of goblins as he escaped through a secret passage behind an oven. Omar had run into the forest, and watched the goblins, maniacally laughing as they hoisted black banners with the Katalivorg standard to the skies, leave nearly as quickly as they had come. The town was left unpillaged, but they all knew what had happened. The citizens were merely waiting for their new rulers to come, and they were quaking in their boots. They knew who the Katalivorgs were.At that moment, Willa knew what she'd be doing now. She had received her blessing from Yvaine. She walked with Omar in her wake as she lit herself up again and she burned like the morning sun. She returned to her compatriots and said to them, ""Friends, the war is not over for me yet."" She outlined a plan of expedient guerrilla tactics and robbing the Katalivorg nobles to give to the needy vassals and yeomen of the surrounding lands. ""But, Willa, what of Yvaine? Is this not against her tenants?"" one of her comrades asked. Willa gave a mirthless grunt of laughter. ""No. Yvaine has given me the calling to fight for this. We're going to give these motherfuckers a price for the invasion of the Wiselands.""And so they have been for the past few months, becoming folk heroes, not just in the Wiselands, but beyond. Willa herself has allowed herself her humanity again, to see beauty and happiness and laughter, despite the troubled times. Her Omar, darling baby brother he will always be, was never cut out for violence, and so has instead invested himself to traveling as much of the world as he possibly can and putting what he sees down on a map. He plans on returning soon, having written to Willa that he was traveling to explore the city of Ulkenbac in the Ashlands. Feeding her unease about her brother's safety, that letter was written two months ago. There has been no letter since. So, she has set out from the Wiselands to find her brother - hopefully alive."9/20/2017 13:55:17,Frélaf,Elf,Ranger,Mother killed by orcs9/20/2017 14:07:29,Aidan Scien,Human,Fighter,"Aidan wanted to be a paladin. He'd spent years in the local church of Azuth, the main god in the area as his town was built around a wizard college, training to become a paladin. After many years of training, he finally took his solemn vigil to commune with his god. And Azuth finally spoke to him to inform him his connection to the divine was unfit for use as a paladin. However, he was told to talk to the college about becoming an eldritch knight. Disappointed, yet happy that his god had given him a path, he spoke to the wizards who found he was rather bright for a paladin in training, and switched him over to learn the ways of magic. Once his training was complete, he set out to bring good and justice to the world as an eldritch knight, and maybe some books for the college library as repayment for their teaching."9/20/2017 14:10:13,Goragog Nazur,Orc,Warlock,"Goragog lived under the blood sodden banner of the ""Sand Scar Horde"", a chiefdom of Nomadic Desert Orcs who roamed the Wurm wake Wastes.

She refused. resulting in the caravans death from a worm attack, as well as hers - their bodies were never found.The night before a raid on a fort, founded and defended by the same family of humans responsible for Urug's death, the chief disappears, seemingly without trace.

"9/20/2017 18:49:34,Cirri Gragarren,Shield Guardian,Psion,"Even as a young child, Cirri had innate Psionic power, but it caused such trouble that his parents moved all around the country before finding a School that would accept him. The trade off was that his parents had to pay extremely inflated Tuition fees, and the school catered mostly to Magical Studies, only a small and laughably shabby class for students of Cirri's talents.For the next few years Cirri rose in both knowledge and psionic power. Yet near the end of the 4th year, he began to feel far inferior to the many mages he spent  his school days around. During the fall of his Sophomore year, His close friend showed him his Fall Project, A Shield Guardian, 10 feet of hardened stone and glittering steel that stood proudly in the town square. It could do anything a human could do, and could be ordered to do such at the whim of its creator. Truly in awe, Cirri asked his friend to teach him all there was to know about making such a beautiful creation.  Immediately he sat about putting his grand scheme into action.By the middle of his Junior year, Cirri, with the  had sculpted the perfect body, had his friend help him do the small magical components needed to force the thousands of pounds of material to bend to their combined will. The very last step though, His friend could not help him. Cirri was informed of its Sliver, a tiny crystal embedded within the head of the  Shield Guardian that contained a small piece of its creator's soul. That was the most important part, without the sliver it remained amazing in form, but useless as anything more than a statue. But Cirri said not to worry, for he had been operating with Psi Crystals since his first year of school. He had learned a myriad of uses for them and they were second nature to him. A Crystal is a Crystal after all... What could go wrong?Cirri began preparations of another Psi crystal, this one enchanted by his friend and left as an open receptacle. He had no idea how such tiny differences in appearance and procedure could dramatically alter his fate. In the Psionic world crystals were used to hold a tiny portion of your consciences, a mere fleck of who you were as a person. This allowed greater focus, for this fleck was beyond mortal concerns and could shed insight on any problem, but in your own words and feelings. They were of an immense help to a Psion. Psicrystals, however, worked totally counter intuitively to  the Control Crystals used to produce a shield guardian's eternal loyalty. Cirri, of course, had not a clue nor care in the world.As he finished all the required gestures and incantations, Cirri reached deep into his mind to perform the final act, the act of shaving off a tiny portion of his being to inhabit the crystal. A blinding flash of searing pain later, He was picking himself off the floor... with hands not his own.In his great rush, Cirri, eager to have nothing more than a new toy, had instead transferred his mind and soul into this crystal, leaving none to inhabit his real body. After a great bit of wailing and sadness shared with his family, Cirri and his parents sought out the greatest healers, mages, and psions in their kingdom but came home unable to deny the horror of the situation. Hours later, crying but unable to shed actual tears, his mother and father helped as he used his new gleaming body to bury his own flesh and blood in the local cemetery. Seven thousand years later, through wars, droughts, plagues, the rise and fall of empires, the one-by-one death of everyone he has ever loved, and uncountable sleepless nights, walks a Brilliant Metal Man with power beyond words. But in the myriad of days since his death and rebirth, there is one thing Cirri Gragarren is most proud of. He has finally learned to cry."9/20/2017 18:53:22,Maikalin Errolson,half-elf,ranger,"A blacksmith-in-training apprenticed to an abusive father, he married young, only to have his pregnant wife turned into a dog by a terrible curse.

While visiting his wife Holly in Neverwinter, he fought off a terrorist attack (by the Zhentarim). He got slightly famous for doing so, and unfortunately found the new notoriety interfered with his day job. Nothing was simple anymore, especially expectations and he’s peers’ candidness. Jon didn’t cope well with this; he kept it in. His previous disagreements with Holly began to compound and overflow when he shut her out of his troubles. After one particularly bad shift, he came home to find a letter from Neverwinter: she has new opportunity and she’s cutting him loose to give it her all with a clean slate. She didn’t tell him what or where. (We’re in the beginning of Die Hard 3 here.) His spiral went deeper. He was soon suspended, demoted, suspended again, and ultimately transferred to police the northern roads reaching to Thornhold and Amphail. (The City Watch usually doesn’t operate outside of the city walls, but apparently one of the Masked Lords of Waterdeep… motivated the Commander of the Watch to make an exception.)This unique and solitary jurisdiction turned out to suit John well. He slowly found some peace with himself in this more isolated job --- one he’s excelling at again --- at the thinner edges of civilization. There are still good people living here, putting in hard work, taking care of each other, and fighting off the wilderness with barely token help from the city’s nobles back behind their walls.Over time John found the core Waterdhavian laws that most tenaciously uphold have been now revealed to be reflections of those of Nature and the balanced participation of people in. Ten years later, he’s now a Ranger, cooperating loosely and at a distance with the druids and rangers of the Emerald Enclave to stop the world’s vile, unnatural threats wherever and whenever (preferably before!) they rear their ugly face. (He’s not yet a member of the Enclave, but trusts their judgement and accepted their employ, which has taken him farther and farther into the wilderness.) He’s long since retired from the Waterdeep city watch, but his Emerald Enclave tasks do occasionally drag him reluctantly back into the human strongholds of the North: Waterdeep, Neverwinter, and so on. Returning to those places haunted by his old life never goes well, and he avoids it as much as possible.Now that he’s centered himself, John has relaxed his focus on Enclave matters just enough to start wondering about a new mission: finding Holly and making things right again, showing her his new life."9/20/2017 20:00:45,Surreal,Half-elf,Rogue,Her mother died when she was a child and she turned to prostitution and quickly turned to assassination whenever the clients wouldn't pay her 9/20/2017 20:01:26,"Brynna ""Jeweltongue"" Ironbrew",Dwarf,Bard,"Brynna grew up in a small village in a family of four, joined by her parents and younger sister, Rosia.

Fritz learned, from an early age, how to accompany her dances on various instruments—lute, flute, concertina, bones—and how to collect the thrown money before the drunker folks in the front of the crowd tried to reclaim it and turn it into more ale. He and his younger sister, Helena, would seamlessly trade off musical duties to take turns fetching the coins that showered the stage (or, in harder times, sprinkled it) while ducking the whirling limbs of Mama and their two older sisters, Berthe and Marja.  In between dances came the songs, the stories, the jokes, the acrobatics. Fritz and Helena sang treble against Berthe and Mama’s deeper contraltos; Marja, not much of a singer, was the money collector then, but when it came time to get the crowd laughing, she took command of the performance. All of the children were acrobats—Mama had trained them, almost from birth it seemed, to juggle, flip, balance, leap, and twist in ways that made women gasp and men struggle to pretend they hadn’t gasped just as loudly. During the acrobatic segments, their rickety wagon barely managed to support the more elaborate routines, many of which threatened to hurl the Hanswurst children out into the audience, all of whom waited breathlessly for just such an instance. The only one who didn’t take part in any of this was Papa. Fritz’s Papa wasn’t a singer or a dancer, a juggler or a comedian; all of those gifts came from Mama. Papa would do whatever he could—preach a little gospel, sell a couple bottles of “Dr. Good.” Dr. Good wasn’t really that different from the ale the drunks wanted, but at least the coins that paid for the Dr. ended up in the family’s tattered purses, not stuck to the bar of some seedy village saloon. The gospel Papa preached changed from town to town, depending on the local God. That was Papa’s gift; he could make a crowd feel a religious ecstasy the priests of the temples never could. During his speeches, nobody moved to collect coins or to throw them, but after he was done the shower usually began in earnest, enough to require all the children at once. Fritz hated all of it: the singing, dancing, juggling, preaching—especially the preaching—and the travelling. The wagon wasn’t big enough for them all to sleep inside, so he usually ended up on the ground under it, huddled up against Helena with only one ratty blanket between them. Papa’s snoring, as thunderous as his prayers, shook the wagon nightly, pelting them with the grit that had settled into the boards over the long days of roaming between villages and towns, or during the even longer days of show after show in the cities. It hadn’t been so bad when Fritz was younger, sleeping inside the wagon with Mama, but when Helena was born he’d been kicked underneath, and he had only stopped resenting her when she chose to join him in his exile, warming him more than the blanket ever had. He still resented Mama and Papa. Life changed when Fritz was twelve, and not just in the way that life changes for everyone at about that age. For Fritz, those intimate, personal changes spurred him to bigger ones, ones that disrupted the family routine for everyone. In Riversend one evening, after a particularly successful run of performances, the family dispersed to purchase the supplies they needed for their next sojourn, through Tal Morai to Easar and stopping everywhere along the way and some places that weren’t. Fritz, with Helena in tow, was to purchase tar—the wagon had long needed patching, and there was nowhere in the kingdom where tar was cheaper. The man (or boy really, but 16 seems like a man to a twelve-year-old) who was selling tar at the first booth the children encountered was stunning. Perfectly formed, in Fritz’s eyes, the man was slender, pale-skinned, and had close-cropped hair that might have bespoken a need to keep his head tar-free, but to Fritz appeared just the height of fashion. Fritz gaped and stammered and bought twice the tar the family needed, at nearly three times the price it was worth. He was smitten. When Mama saw the amount of tar he and overburdened little Helena brought back to the wagon camped outside of town, her eyes hardened. When she heard what they had paid for it, they nearly popped out of her head. Her furious berating far outdid anything Papa was capable of at his loudest, whether preaching or snoring; she nearly upended one of the buckets over Fritz’s head, but Marja restrained her, and she merely slopped it onto the already black and stinking soil. After some adroit questioning from Berthe, Helena revealed the reason for Fritz’s fiscal irresponsibility, and the younger women nodded knowingly; they’d seen the young tar merchant in question, and they could tell precisely why poor Fritz, usually so good with money for his age, had been no match for his salesmanship. Mama and Papa were far from pleased, but there was nothing they could do—the tar merchants didn’t take their wares back. A few more choice words from Mama, with supportive growls from her husband, and the matter was closed. But for Fritz, it was far from over. The young tar merchant, all unknowingly, had shown him a whole new world, a dazzling place that seemed far from the muddy tracks between towns and the flashy performance that filled every other waking moment. In this world, there were beautiful young men instead of bossy older sisters; dozens of strange faces to observe each day instead of the five he had memorized years ago; and stable, stationary canvas booths instead of rolling wagons with no home. There was only one thing about the old world that he actually liked, the collecting money part of the show, and the new world seemed to have that part all the time! That was the last night Fritz spent under the wagon watching the paint peel and shutting his eyes against the falling silt. Early the next morning, before anyone else had even begun to consider waking up, Fritz was ready to go. He had stowed everything he needed inside one of the now-empty tar buckets before going to sleep, and now he slipped quietly out from under the blanket and picked up the bucket. As he turned back to bitterly spit towards the life he had always hated so, Helena sat up and silently waved goodbye. Fritz swallowed the spit and a sudden lump in his throat, waved back, and trudged off back toward Riversend. “Jack” had been called that for sixteen years now. Since leaving his family and his all-too-recognizable name, he’d seen nearly as many towns as he saw in his first twelve years. His dream of a stable life was no more than a childhood memory, and a none-too-pleasant one. A penniless boy has very little to offer the world and the world has even less to offer him—at least for free. Jack had matured quickly (with the help, one memorable fortnight, of that selfsame tar merchant), and he discovered early on that his Mama’s training served him well in areas quite distinct from theatrical performance; for about fourteen years now he’d been making his living as a thief. Agility, speed, and a sure-handed grace with a knife had gotten him far in the kingdom—both figuratively and literally, as he didn’t care to stay in any one place long enough for the law or his family to catch up with him.  The bitterness that Jack had felt toward the family had not faded over the years. Rather, the disillusionment that had followed on the heels of their estrangement had simply increased and generalized the bitterness; Jack didn’t like much of anyone anymore. He barely remembered why he felt that way, but he knew that the only person who really mattered was his youngest sister, Helena, and that he wouldn’t ever see her again without having to go back to the false smiles, incessant energy, and incredible discomfort of being an itinerant entertainer. He was in no way inclined to try that again, and he had absolutely no idea that being a thief who pretended, in well-lit and well-populated areas, to be anything but, was really quite a similar occupation.  Recently, Jack had decided to move from back-alley thievery to a higher-class, more breaking-and-entering burglary. Availing himself, after long years, of the musical half of his training, he purchased a few instruments—showing his roots even more—and used his reluctant but polished performances as opportunities to case rich houses. Never performing more than once in a town, so as not to be remembered by the cultural elite, he began to amass quite a bit of wealth (for a thief), and decided to attend a party of movers and shakers at the home of the Baron Orran..."9/20/2017 23:46:42,Casimir,halfling,cleric,"Casimir came from a magical community called the Fold (basically, think of a cloister crossed with an Amish settlement populated by magically-adept halflings, and tucked away in an extradimensional space). In the Fold, people communicate through telepathy, using ideas and sensations, so no one learns spoken or written language. You’re allowed to leave as an adult, but you can never come back, because the Fold is magically guarded and impossible to find. He left because he didn’t believe what people told him, that the world outside is a terrible place. But so far they were mostly right, so he’s sort of on a lowkey quest to prove that there are good things in the world. Of course, Casimir's only been speaking for the few months since his quest began, so he’s very bad at expressing himself, tending towards odd gramatical constructions and completely inscrutable metaphors. Nonetheless, he fell into the company of a band of adventurers, who were glad to have an arcanist, and tolerated his strangeness while he picked up the quirks of language.

As one of the more long lived races at the orphanage during her teenage years she became quite adept at mediating and breaking up fights between other orphans. She was happy there. However the orphanage being located way out in the wilds where pitchfork wielding humans were unlikely to venture, opportunities for arcane advancement were limited. When the time came that Risal was more caretaker than vulnerable orphan and space was needed for more orphaned intakes, Risal declared herself the most able to survive on her own out there in the world. She left. In search of Arcane secrets she negotiated passage on a ship to a foreign land. Already deeply suspicious of adults Risals formative travels did more to increase her suspicion and paranoia than alleviate them.

"9/21/2017 4:48:30,Rosemary Reid,Human,Horror Vlogess,"Rosemary grew up in the Reid clan, a long-time Jedburgh family known for their thriving masonry business. She has many brothers, probably not worth naming for a one-shot. She grew up a committed tomboy and, together with best friend Jon, a comics and horror movie junkie. They spent many all nighters watching gore-fests on bootleg dvds, and pinky-swore they'd go on to better things together. When Jon disappeared, she went completely goth - forgot any ambitions, worked in the family business and other odd jobs, smoked a lot, and watched a TON of terrible movies. By the end of her 20's, she had become a fixture at The Pit, the local comic and DVD shop owned by Kurt Wilson across from the graveyard. She gave her life to that shop, started bringing in the cool horror anime and collectible figures. She even started a video blog, The Last Girl's Revenge, where she reviews cult classics and deconstructs the genre. She has a bit where she pretends all horror has a shared mythology, unravels the logic behind the monsters, and floats outlandish theories that catch on in certain fan circles. She does a lot of mail-order business.These days she runs The Pit, having almost completely bought out Kurt. She's a sensible business woman and has no other life, having mostly exhausted the local dating pool due to her low tolerance for bullshit and unwillingness to change her life in any way. She's only mildly goth now - still the black hair and nails, but just as likely to throw a flannel shirt over her Hills Have Eyes t-shirt. She knows every suburban myth and true-crime story in the county, as well as anybody who's ever had countertops put in."9/21/2017 5:57:56,Tamoni ,Orc ,Fighter ,"Tamoni grew up as the middle child of her large family in an isolationist orc compound.

Curiously, they're both half-elves, he's pretty sure he's a half-elf, too - which puts him well ahead of many of his racial peers who can't decide whether they're elves with human blood or humans with elven blood.He had a happy childhood, with no more than the usual aches and growing pains.  He got his sense of humor from his father and his impetuousness from his mother.  Both parents are often proud, usually exasperated, and always amused by his pranks and exploits.He finds paladins absolutely hilarious and will often pretend to be one if he needs to take on an alternate identity.  He's been more or less successful, depending on how much effort he's willing to put into the gag - considering he usually claims to be a paladin of Ahaz, this trick is rarely successful with people who know a thing or two about religion.  He generally expects people to be foolish, uninformed, or simply inattentive, and is often correct.He steals what he needs from those he thinks have more than they need, but generally prefers tricking them into giving it to him.  He'll put in an honest day's work if he absolutely has to, but it's a last resort.  He seldom keeps what he gets, though.  It's not so much that he squanders his earnings, but rather he is supremely confident in his ability to get more if he needs it again, so he sees no reason to save up.He prays to Ahaz pretty much constantly, usually half in jest, but also half seriously because he always needs the luck.  The day the god actually answered one of his prayers directly involved a traveling lord, the lord's daughter, a herd of pigs, and most of a jug of rum.  The lord, for his part, is still proud of the assistance he was able to render to the Holy Paladins of Ahaz.  The daughter also remembers the incident fondly, with only marginally more accuracy.  Demaile, who is the only one who really knows what happened (with the exception of some of the parts involving the rum) came away with a slight limp where his foot didn't quite heal properly, an intimate piece of women's apparel (that he promptly lost), and the lord's signet.  He also emerged with a newfound respect for what it really means for Ahaz to answer a prayer.  He considered it a sobering lesson up until his foot healed enough that he could dance again, at which point he decided that it was, instead, an exciting lesson, and he has been a devoted follower of Ahaz ever since (as much as he is devoted to anything).  He keeps the lord's signet and uses it the way most other clerics would use a holy symbol.  It also comes in handy if he needs to forge something official-looking, so that's nice, too.Of course, if you ask him his history Demaile won't tell you any of this.  He'll tell you something involving dragons and orphans, and perhaps a dark ritual gone awry, a quest for vengeance, or whatever else suits his fancy.  If he considers you interesting or important enough, he might even tell you the same story the next time you ask him, but probably not."9/21/2017 8:19:44,Akia Izumi,human,Sorcerer,9/21/2017 9:08:28,Elisa Warsong,Human,Monk,"So!Eli doesn't know her parents. She was left at the Monastary of the Blooming Dagwood when she was three or four – the monks aren't even really sure, just that this small girl was left with only a note bidding them to raise her, and a small necklace with a a pair of simple steel rings – wedding bands with no obvious clue as to the owners. They, being monks, of course took her in and started raising Elisa Warsong, a girl with a quick grin and easy humor, that gave everyone a good boost of energy.She lived there until she was seventeen, learning how to craft tools from the wood of the orchards of dagwood that were always in season, helping with tasks, and being the youngest member of a community that normally took people in at the age of sixteen.That was when Rieta came into her life – a Tiefling woman clad in a travellers cloak and the clothing of a scholar, not there to commit herself to the celibate teachings of the Blooming Dagwood monks, but to learn from them, and perhaps, should she make a mark on the Monastary, commission a wand made of Dagwood for herself.Eli delighted in someone so close to her age being in the cloister. She and Rieta spent all of their free time together – and eventually a romance blossomed between them, a secret one that was eventually revealed. Rieta's welcome was withdrawn and Elisa was given a choice – go with Reita and leave the only home she'd ever had, or stay and renounce this newfound love.She left the next morning, with a carved dagwood charm on her necklace, and a strong bo strapped to her back, and her hand in Rieta's.They found a small village to settle in, and a small house with two stories and a modest basement for Rieta to practice her magic in. Life is good for a good few years.Eli stays around the village, helping whereever she can. Rieta travels at times, always yearning for more knowledge, more understanding of the world and the arcane powers she could wield. She always came back through.And thenwhen Elisa was 25, Reita started spending more and more time in the basement. She'd had to go downstairs more often than not just to get Reita to come upstairs for dinner.Something was wrong but whenever Elisa approached it, she'd be shut down, and for fear of starting arguments with the only family she had, she never pushed it.For years later, she'd wish that she had.Reita locked herself away for two days straight, and Elisa could hear a racket downstairs.She went downstairs to investigate and found Reita in a pitch black basement save for a few candles, and a glowing purple circle etched into the dirt.Elisa tried to stop whatever spell Reita was casting that sent chills down Eli's spine, but she was thrown back into a pillar of the basement and crumpled into an unconcious heap.When she woke up, the basement was empty – and flooded with sunlight. The house above was halfway destroyed (her most beloved belongings miraculously survived) and when she staggered up the stairs – so was most of the town, a scarred circle of ash and smoke where friends she'd known for years once lived.There were no other survivors – or at least, none that she could find. No bodies, either.Everyone she had known had presumably fallen victim to this dark magic Rieta had fallen into the thrall of.That was the day Eli swore to herself she would get stronger. She would get stronger so that noone else would die depending on her the way that ruined town did. And so if she ever crossed paths with Rieta, she would be prepared. She now travels, aiming to help as many people as she can."9/21/2017 9:17:56,Whispers in the Shadow,Tabaxi,Monk,"Shadow Assasin for a church, noble in daily life working for his father who is a trader"9/21/2017 9:54:51,Korzora,Halfling,Rogue,"Orphan who was raised at an orphanage/school/training camp thing that trains them to be adventurers and then sends them off to adventure.

Its form is maintained through the collective psionic effort of the githzerai who live there.  All who have glimpsed enlightenment are welcome there, even githyanki who are normally the githzerai’s sworn enemies.  As a result of the way Arsanith is constructed and formed, it is impossible for creatures to hurt or harm each other within its limits.  It was constructed such that, if someone were to overcome the anti-harm spell placed on the city, the entire city would collapse into itself and become absorbed in the chaos that surrounds it.  In any case, overcoming that spell would be extremely difficult.  There is a similar prohibition on using psionic effects to control another’s mind unwillingly, although this can be bypassed by members of the Arsanith leadership on occasion.Ezhelya’s fellows were training from childhood to be fighting monks, mystics, or symbiotes, learning to make use of their psionic abilities to fight effectively without armor or weapons.  When their training was complete, they would leave the monastery and form bands to roam the planes and kill illithids and githyanki.  The prescence of githyanki in Arsanith made this something of a contradiction, but githzerai do recognize that there is variation among individuals within a race and considered the githyanki in Arsanith worthy of their respect.Ezhelya was a rare Githzerai born with a complete inability to use psionic powers, so she could not train in the usual gith classes.  At age eight, she met and became enamored with an old warrior, Cordelia, who had abandoned her calling to come study at Arsanith.  Inspired by Cordelia, Ez decided that learning to fight with heavy armor and a sword would be the best way to make up for her lack of psionic talent.  Cordelia cautioned her that the path of a fighter could lead to much bloodshed and suffering, but Ezhelya was stubborn and could not be swayed.As the young gith began monk training, Ezhelya worked on her own to develop her physical strength.  She found an old, beaten up sword and shield in the back of a storeroom, and trained to fight with those.  There was no armor anywhere in the monastery, so she sewed rocks and bits of metal into her clothes and put them in her backpack to practice fighting while carrying heavy loads. At age 15, the leaders at the monastery decided she had proven herself enough to merit crafting a suit of scale armor for her, as well as a new shield and sword.About a year after that, January Szclainski showed up at Arsanith.  January was an Illithid who, for some reason, turned out to not be evil like most Illithids are.  She thought going around to do evil stuff was boring and wanted to learn about the various races and cultures of the planes instead.  She left her Illithid colony at age 10 and came to Arsanith at age 13 (Equivalent to age 16 in human/gith years).  She wanted to learn more about githzerai due to their relationship with illithids.She knew she wouldn’t be welcome in most githzerai communities due to their well-known hatred of “mind flayers,” as they call illithids.  But she figured they’d let her live at Arsanith if she could convince them she had glimpsed enlightenment—if githyanki could live there, why not her?  Her plan worked, although she had to keep stunning people who were trying to kill her for awhile before they realized she wasn’t evil.  After that, convincing them that she was enlightened wasn’t too hard.Ezhelya got to know January better than any other githzerai during those two years.  Possibly because she was already different, she found herself drawn towards people who were even more “outsider” than her.   For whatever reason, she and Jan became good friends.One years later, Jan decided it was her time to move on.  Ezhelya was 17, almost at the age when she would leave the monastery anyhow.  She had kind of a crisis at that time—she suddenly realized that devoting her life to killing githyanki and mind flayers just wasn’t what she wanted to do.  She had learned so much about other worlds from January and she wanted to go out and see them for herself, not as a fighter but as an explorer.  She also realized that she was in love with January and didn’t want to be separated.  So she confessed her love to January and asked to leave Arsanith with her, a year before she was meant to.  January was like “cool sounds good to me” They moved to the Kapisi civiliation and started a bakery.  They lived happily as a couple for about a year and a half.  Romantic love was kind of an alien concept to January but she was party chill about it and they made it work.  January baked bread that she sold to the townspeople.  Ezhelya felt kind of aimless during this time.  The only thing she knew was that she wanted to be with January and do whatever January did.  She helped Jan at the bakery and learned a bit of baking.  She took odd jobs around the village, as much for the learning experience as to make money.  She kept practicing fighting, but not in the driven, single minded way she had before she met January.  It was just something she was good at, a skill she might be able to use later.To be continued…"9/21/2017 10:29:09,Elaine Moonbloom,Elf,Druid,Prince who ran away to live in the forest9/21/2017 10:30:24,Socks Proboscis Gelato,Half-Elf,Paladin,Blind guy from a healer family who ran away9/21/2017 10:30:43,Muta,Tabaxi,Barbarian,He's a cat.9/21/2017 10:34:05,Laoise,Human,Druid,"An Orphan, Laoise became a Swashbuckler at an early age and adventured in the underground town she grew up in.

During this time she became skilled in the art of entertainment (singing, fire-eating and juggling being her main acts) and their joint act (called The Wailing Sirens) never failed to impress their audience. However, her father grew old and weary of their travels and was forced to retire to a farm in Red Larch. With her solo act she struggled to make ends meet. Then one night, after a performance, she was approached by a dwarf called Brolin and ask to join him and his gang of seemingly shady individuals at their table. After watching her perform, they figured her skills would come in handy for their gang, known as the hand of Yartar. All through the night they shared stories of their mischievous deeds and all of the coin that they had made. And after a full night of drinking together, she decided to join them. After a couple of years, she built up quite an impressive reputation in the guild with her excellent thievery skills. Then one day, she was sent on an important mission to collect a great treasure, the mummified hand of a renowned saint. However, before they were able to deliver the treasure, Brolin mysteriously disappeared with the item still in his possession.

Wildrose couldn't stand for this (especially as the keystone of the ritual was a precious jewel with a composition unlike any other in the world), and so she rallied the rats to rise up against the reptilian cultists, discovering in the process that she was a natural leader and had an excellent mind for clever strategy and deadly traps.

When she awoke, weeks later, she was in a monastery run by clerics of Ioun who had been alerted to her plight by an omen from the goddess.  They told her that she had been saved, and granted new powers by Ioun, to track down the orc and exact ruthless vengeance on him.  This appalled Ceta.  She wanted rest, and quiet, and healing, and time to mourn.  Instead she was to be sent forth to enact violence and death.

By the time they arrived, they were both tired, so they didn’t bother with lighting a candle, or the fire. Instead, they both crawled into bed, and made love. In the morning, however, Elannan woke up, and, realizing what he had done, killed himself. Took his hunting knife, and stabbed himself twice in the gut, and once in the chest. He bled out on the floor. Gurthanna woke up minutes later, and saw Elannan lying on the planks, dead. His hair had fallen over his ears, and Gurthanna, blinded by grief, still didn’t realize that he was an elf. She fled the cabin, and ran back to town. She concealed her grief well, though some people notice a slight change in her behaviour. She had stopped going out into the woods to hunt, and stayed at home for longer periods of time. 8 months later, Keagan was born. His elvish blood wasn’t apparent at first, but by the age of 5 his ears were more pronounced. His mother tried to hide him from the village, but it was inevitable that he would venture outside. By the age of 11, his mother had great trouble, keeping him inside. It was also at this age that he began getting far more elegant and graceful than any pureblooded human. When Keagan turned 14, he snuck outside for the first time. He became quite good at this, eventually. By the age of 15, it was apparent to even him that he wasn’t fully human. He decided to keep this a secret, though, and wove a net of lies, and made a mask of naivety. These skill would help him later in his life. By the age of 17, Keagan took up fencing and knife throwing to pass the time. Eventually, he bored of fencing imaginary opponents, so he bid his mother farewell. But, instead of doing this verbally, he snuck out in the dead of night, leaving a note for his mother to find. He wore his cloak with the hood up, to conceal his face, and slouched slightly to conceal his height. He took only his rapier and kunai. He travelled East, with no destination in mind, following the road. He kept following it as it grew wider, a sign that he was getting closer to a larger city. It was here that he put his disguising abilities to the test. He came upon a caravan, and was trying to pass it, when the owner ran up to him. The owner had seen Keagan’s sword, and needed some more guards on the caravan. Keagan declined at first, but the owner offered him a large sum of gold. He accepted, if only because he needed the gold. They were a few hours from the city when bandits attacked. Keagan had dismounted his horse to give it some rest, and when the bandits attacked, his horse bolted. Keagan dove into the bushes, to avoid incoming crossbow fire, and snuck towards the bandits. There were five of them, and only one of him. All the other defenders had been shot full of crossbow bolts. As the bandits drew near, he silently grabbed his kunai, and unsheathed his sword. Once the bandits drew level with Keagan, he threw his kunai. It hit the lead bandit straight in the chest. He charged out and fell a second with a quick slash to the throat. His speed and stealth allowed him to stab a third, before the remaining two realised what was going on. Keagan retrieved his kunai, and ducked under a swing. The bandits had maneuvered so one was on his left, and one on his right. He parried a blow from the left, and staggered as the flat of a sword hit him in the chest. He thought quickly, as he stumbled backwards, and then he threw himself backwards. He clutched at his chest, feigning pain. The bandits inched forwards, eager to finish him off. Quick as lightning, Keagan’s hand flashed out, throwing his kunai. It missed. The bandits followed it with their eyes. Seconds later they were both dead, easily dispatched with a few blows from a chakram Keagan had found on a corpse he had fallen next to. Keagan tore a few strips of cloth off a bandit’s shirt, and wrapped his left hand; the chakram had cut him when he swung it. He never took those strips off, keeping them as a memento of his first kills. He realised that as a half-elf, he would never fit in, and he loathed that fact. He realised he enjoyed killing these men, then shook his head. He must stay true to what his mother taught him. Only kill when necessary. But.. Keagan decided to put this moral dilemma off for the moment. He spoke with the owner of the caravan, who was very grateful, and they continued onwards. Once they reached the town, Keagan received his pay. He decided to stay in town for a while. There he stayed, honing his skills of stealth and deception, mastering the art of killing by being an assassin. He did this for 3 years, then set out for the coast. He hoped to get an overseas mission, and see the world. When he arrived, he attempted to resume work as usual. A few months later, he was approached by the mercenaries’ guild. They wanted him to be part of the guild, As a medium ranking agent. He accepted, on the terms that the guild would provide for him, at least in the city, and also pay him a small salary. Soon after he joined, he was given his first mission. It was to go see an old man by the name of Jacel, and assist him in his goal."9/21/2017 23:17:45,Thu'rum Quartzheart,Dwarf,Berserker,"Born in Boshkin, Thu’rum was raised on tales of the motherland, and the mysterious black mountain . Like any child, he wanted to see these tales for himself. And unlike most tales, these ones were true, and could be seen. Thu’rum was given to his grandparents at a young age, soon after his father was terribly injured by a mining accident. He never knew his mother, but he knew that she was a part of an evil cult. He had four siblings. 2 sisters and 2 brothers. His older sister always despised him, and most siblings do, but this hate ran deeper. She blamed Thu’rum for all the misfortunes the family had. Thu’rum accepted this, but it hardened him. He loved his siblings, but when his younger sister was murdered by one of Thu’rum’s rivals at his school, he had enough. He beat the boy within an inch of his life. The guards hauled him away, and threw him in jail for 6 years. When he was released, he had seen the error of his ways. Both the dwarves had been in the same prison, and they had become allies, if not friends. Thu’rum would never forget his sister, but he never saw his family again. Saddened, he became a heavy drinker. To make money, he acted as a fence for a gang, gettin in good terms with them. All Thu’rum did was accept goods, and drink. This went on for 8 years. By the time Thu’rum came to his senses, he was 107. He decided to stop helping the gang, and became a mercenary,. A guard for hire. He protected many caravans, and became quite well know. During one of his journeys, he encountered a bear. The rest of the guards ran in terror, but Thu’rum stood his ground, angry that the caravan had been delayed. He roared loudly, and, much to everyone’s surprise, began to change. As he straightened up, he grew taller, nearly double his height, and his limbs got thicker. It was as if he had simply been leaning over, and now he straightened up. He sprouted thick brown fur, all over his body. Some of his humanoid features, such as hands, remained the same, and he still held his hammer and shield. He threw down his shield, gripped the hammer with both hands, and engaged the bear. A long fight ensued, both combatants wrestling back and forth. Eventually, Thu’rum ripped the bear’s throat out. Breathing heavily, he leaned against a tree, and returned to normal. He retrieved his tools, made an amulet out of the bear’s claw, and continued on as if nothing had happened."9/22/2017 1:01:03,Raia,Gnoll,Shaman,"Ranivorus, patron Immortal of the gnolls, is said to bestow multiple personalities on particularly holy gnolls as signs of his favor.

When a war cry was sent out to rally the tribes to the great King Thar's banner, Raia was eager to serve, but an omen from the Immortals sent her off in a different direction, into human lands.  They are still not sure what their task is, though Raia-ravi studies everything to look for signs, but the surprising compassion and acceptance some of the humans have shown them is sowing doubt and confusion inside.

She had a short fling with a dwarf during the campaign to retake the lost forge of Merggon.  I was always bookish as a child, and would stay up stargazing with Mum. I was apprenticed to an astronomer named Aramil Naïlo at the age of 6.  My mother went to fight in defending the island of Myren, nearby to our island of Alora.  I was forced to watch the city burn in the distance as my mother died.  Horribly. The survivors return, and I went to the infirmary to see if mother was there.  Many of the survivors were injured, and told gruesome stories of what the goblins did to those who fell in combat.  I approached the avatar of Sylvia, Taleshi, and offered to become a conduit through which she would be able to smite those responsible for the death of my mother and the destruction of my city.  I was branded as a conduit (I told my master I was sick the next day), and was given a book through which I can study, cast spells, and communicate with my patron, Taleshi.  About 2 weeks later, I haven't been given any assignments, only training, so I decided to try and get some “practical experience” by leaving the islands of Imeth to go on a great adventure.

There, she was raised in a collective with a group of other children from the cult (her brood-mates) by Helvella, an older member of the cult.Both ""Amanita"" and her closest friend from her brood-mates, Galerina, showedmagical potential—as a druid and cleric respectively. Before their coming-of- age ceremonies at age 16, though, Amanita and Galerina got impatient to test their abilities, which led to Amanita growing her first plant companion. However, Amanita was only used to seeing fungus incorporated symbiotically with thecult—she had never seen it act as a parasite, or kill. So, when the cult’s fungusinfected her plant companion and ultimately killed it, Amanita had a horrifyingawakening to the true nature of Zuggtmoy: the fungus wasn’t a source of unity and family, but of unnatural death. Galerina tried to reassure her, to no avail. And the night before the coming-of- age ceremony, Amanita ran away from the Family.She lived for several years alone, surviving in the woods based on her small herbal knowledge, but staying on the move to remain out of reach of the cult. It was during this period of time when she changed her name to Hawthorn. Eventually, the renamed Hawthorn joined the Von Raud household, a wealthy family of nobles the next kingdom over, who employed her as a gardener and herbalist. Hawthorn became close to the Von Raud’s daughter, Eliisabet (“Liis” for short). Liis tutored Hawthorn in reading and writing in exchange for instruction in botany. (This is how Hawthorn discovered her love of children’s books, which would later be how her current plant companion, Susan the Mulberry, got her name—after a favorite character.) Eventually, Hawthorn and Liis fell in love.Meanwhile, however, the Von Raud family had become involved in a necropolitandeath cult, interested in pursuing undeath for power through immortality—andthey expected their daughter to convert to undeath with them. Hawthorn tried to convince Liis not to follow her parents, but was too frightened to confess her past and thereby fully explain why she was so distrustful of cults. Liis ignored her warnings.The ritual of crucimigration is horrifying indeed—both to undergo and to watch, and Liis came to regret her choice... but only after it was too late to turn back from undeath. Instead, she did the next best thing, and she and Hawthorn ran away from the Von Rauds together.For the past several years, they have lived in hiding in the forest, with Hawthorntrying to use druidic abilities to restore Liis to life. Since nothing has worked, nowHawthorn is leaving to try to find other methods of saving the woman she loves.

They started mouthing off some racist bullcrap at the siblings about being half-breeds or whatever, and then started a fight with her brother. Things got a bit too intense, and since her brother had studied some spells, he attempted to use magic on Fritz. The spell backfired horribly, and when the dust cleared, her brother laid in a still, lifeless heap where he had once stood so determinately only moments ago.

Perhaps it is true that Magho misread some sections of the Book of Proverbs from which he loves to quote (being illiterate tends to have this effect), but he genuinely believes it's the thought that counts.  And Magho's original thoughts can probably be counted one hand (or at least they could, could Magho count that high).When he was just 7 years old, Magho's tribe returned from raiding a nearby settlement.  As part of their raid, after took all the loot, they burned everything they deemed as useless, including a mage's pouch of hundreds upon hundreds of valuable magical scrolls.  When the fire was lit, the arcane energy erupted.  Although nobody was killed, Magho was flung from the blast into a boulder.  When he awoke, dazed and confused, he picked up one of the scrolls and he saw a light turn on in front of him.  Perceiving this as a sign, Magho believed he just witnessed a spiritual calling.  (The light he saw was a prestidigitation cantrip triggered by one of the scrolls.) Astounded at all this, he began to closely observe his surroundings and discovered a scroll from the explosion.  Magho knew this paper contained the key to understanding life, the universe, and everything.  It was a blank sheet of parchment.  From then on, he studied this scroll of knowledge instead of  going out and fighting with his friends, until he turned 12.Magho was exiled from his tribe on his 12th birthday.  It is tradition in his tribe that to become a man at this age one must enter into a battle with the tribe's chieftain.  Upon entering the Ring of Valor, Magho sat cross-legged in the dirt and began reciting his learnings. ""The short story of our lives is a story made of untold endings and forgotten beginnings;  He who fights first is the one who is going to show tonight without their best hat;  Little things are small, so are smaller things.""  The tribe looked around at each other in disbelief, and soon rose up, cried out for his name never to be uttered by another tribesman ever again and exiled him with none of his belongings.After months of traveling by foot through the deserts and the plains, Magho came upon a group of three hairless men wearing dresses.  They were sitting in a circle with their eyes closed on the ground.  After observing them from afar for a few hours, Magho caught sight of an ogre from this corner of his eye.  It was in flight! As it descended towards the men, Magho picked up a long branch from the ground, charged it, leapt off a rock, and dashed out its brains with one miraculous swing.  The men broke their trance and saw the aftermath of what transpired.  Grateful as they were to have been saved from the ogre magi, they granted Magho rest at their monastery.  Mistaking their kindness for an invitation to join their order, Magho never left.

His father Tasgall was a ranger and member of the Pathfinder Society and his mother Apirka was a cleric of Gozreh. As a child Addrir was very withdrawn and often had trouble socializing and fitting in to any particular peer group. His parents were killed by soldiers of Ruthazek while they were out in the forest east of Nantambu. Addrir was only six years old when he learned of the death of his parents. After they died he went to live with his uncle Ailig on the outskirts of Nantambu. Addrir enjoyed being out of the city center and more immersed in nature. Ailig was a druid and while began to teach Addrir about nature and the ways of the druid, he also suffered greatly from a personality disorder that would cause him to fluctuate between periods of great anger and periods of quiet withdrawnness. At his worst in the periods of anger he would take it out on anyone around him, and living in isolation this was often Addrir. Addrir was often physically and mentally abused by Ailig. Even with all the abuse Addrir was fascinated by the ways of the druid and he put up with it to learn more about the druids path. Over time the abuse really began to wear at Addrir and he felt he knew enough to make it on his own. After living and training with his Uncle for three years Addrir decided to leave. His dislike of the large city atmosphere and love of nature led him to run away into the forest of the Mwangi Expanse. Addrir had always had an affinity for nature and training as a Druid had sparked something inside of him. He survived in the forest alone living off the land for a while until disaster struck. One day while Addrir was out foraging for food he saw a small contingent of Ruthazek's soldiers and was seen by them. He attempted to escape, but was caught and beaten within an inch of his life and left for dead, unconscious and bleeding in the middle of the forest. Shortly after the departure of the soldiers a great breeze began to blow in the area and storm clouds rolled in. There was a great thunderstorm and a lightning bolt shot down from the sky and struck Addrir in the middle of the chest, but instead of killing him it transported him to a timeless place where he communed with the deity Gozreh. Addrir surrendered his old life and accepted the blessings and new life from Gozreh and was returned to his body in the forest fully healed and newly adorned with a tattoo of a leaf with a large water droplet falling from it covering a large portion of his back. After waking Addrir was approached by a pair of Elven rangers of the Kallijae tribe who wittnessed the whole event. They were at first content to let him die as they generally regard humans as meddlesome and linked to trouble. However the elves knew and respected Gozreh and saw the dieties divine intervention on the part of Addrir. This softened their opinion of him considerably. They took him back to the elders of the Kallijae tribe and explained what happened. Addrir was permitted to stay with the elves. He had much in common with them and learned vast amounts about the natural world under their tutelage. Slowly over time Addrir discovered new abilities he had access to since his encounter with Gozreh. However old habits die hard and Addrir's predilection for not fitting in reared its head again, exacerbated by the natural differences between elves and humans. After three years with the elves Addrir is over come with a feeling that he is destined for more. Recalling his father's affiliation with the Pathfinder Society Addrir bids farewell to the elves and heads to the Pathfinder Society Lodge and seeks membership. Addrir desires to travel far lands and learn more about the natural world.The local head of the Pathfinder Society was a good friend of Addrir's father and remembered Addrir as a small child. At this point Addrir is too young to become a full fledged member of the Society, but is permitted to help out where he can for food and shelter and to begin light training to prepare him for a life of travel and adventure. After living at the lodge for three years Addrir is offered a chance to go to Avistan by ship to assist with a mission the Society is conducting. Upon reaching Avistan the party encounters a great storm that shipwrecks them in the Mushfens. They are discovered and attacked by Varisian wanderers. Addrir manages to escape, but he is alone again, this time on an unknown continent. Addrir recognizes many similar natural patterns in Varisia. Many things are the same but many are also very different. Addrir begins exploring The Sanos Forest and venturing further in to Avistan to see what is out there."9/26/2017 15:23:21,Vilmar,Elf,Sorcerer,Fighting the good fight - traveling with caravans as a guard for hire.

He then knocked up a whore named Jenora who gave birth to a deformed baby girl named Aria. Aria had six fingers on her left hand, a thin tail, a faint smell of brimstone, and later grew a twisted ram's horn on the right half of her skull in her teenage years. Her mother was forced by the brothel owner to give up her child, but no one was willing to take her until her mother came across the Temple of Giggles.The Temple of Giggles was happy to take her, but not all was as it seemed. To the outside world the Temple of Giggles was a fun loving, frivolous church that worshiped gnomish gods. From the inside it was a cult-like following of people who wish to be whisked away to the plane of Bytopia. Their rituals often involved hallucinogenics and they would indoctrinate new people by infecting them with Crackle Fever.Aria grew up believing that fits of spontaneous laughter was the norm. When she was young she would often break into forced laughter at unpredictable intervals, trying to make herself like the others devotees, but as she got older she only broken into a nervous laughter to keep the other churchgoers from interrogating her.Aria found her passion in translating and transcribing the gnomish scripture into common script, but that passion delved too deep and she began to pray to Deneir in secret. She was caught praying by her mother – who chose to undergo indoctrination so that she might be able to spend more time with her daughter – and recognized the risk when Jenora threatened her for worshiping the gods that forsook them.The Temple of Giggles managed to summon a Deva in the hopes that it would of spirit them from the mortal world to Bytopia, but the angel decided to only take Aria who didn't worship the plane nor the gnomish gods that reside there. The planes perverse goodwill infected Aria, turning her cynicism and anger into kindness and forgiveness. The Deva returned Aria to the mortal world after the goodwill had subjugated her former personality."9/27/2017 6:35:29,Gaylord Freejack,Human,Wizard,"Unaccepted by a bigoted mining community, Gaylord set out into the world to find his fortune - but fortune found him!"9/27/2017 13:40:16,Fat Chavez,Human,Cleric,Homeless9/28/2017 4:36:00,Timon,human,bard,"Timon started out as a regular, happy-go-lucky bard who could neither see nor do any evil.

Due to his parents, he had mostly human features, except for two obious details: his elvish ears and his grey skin. Often bullied by other children and neglected by the owners of the orphanage, Orrin had to adapt to survive his childhood. He learned to get his hands on what he needed even when others wouldn't give it to him, either through guile or charm. Quickly he left the orphanage to try and live on the streets of the slums, where he developped a sense of street smarts, by looking at cheating merchants or the thieves that operated on the streets.He never got the respect others did, though: his grey skin and elfish ears in a human city always got him the ridicule of others, always calling him a grey rat. Especially elves and particularly one or two drow that passed him looked at him with disgust. As such, he's developped a disgust for those who look down on others too, and he finds it necessary that those people will meet him at the same level: if a noble can be humiliated, he will be humiliated! When he works in a tavern at day, he's being tripped or laughed at. Usually those same people would find themselves with a strange liquid in their drinks, causing their bowels to break all food in the process of being processed.The local Thieves Guild, the Sons of the Traveller, did notice his skills and recruited him: from that moment on, Orrin had better protection and became more bold, robbing the houses of the very lords laughing at him or the other unfortunate souls on the street. What was meant as an insult become a badge of pride: The Grey Rat has visited you!This became more symbolic to him when he found Jester: a rat, slightly bigger than normal, whom he trained and kept as a pet. With his help, the thieves guild took on some very bold heists, stealing the signature ring of the head of the merchant's guild, sabotaging the guardhouses throughout the city and, most notably, stealing the sacred book of Onatar, the god of craft.This, however, earned them too much infamy in the eyes of the nobles and merchants: in their next heist, they were betrayed by some of their contacts. They lost two leaders, and were forced to leave Eswick. They decided to move their enterprise elsewhere, and start over with the gold and contacts they had left, but in order to move inconspicuously, they travel seperatly until they reached their new city.At this very moment, Orrin is still traveling, trying to find a new place to call home. Unexpected adventure found him first..."9/28/2017 20:21:59,Vripe,human,rogue,"About as lucky as he is dumb, this rogue is a terrible ally, but a great distraction.

The colourful displays and residual magic of the month's feast days to Nethys would have a permanent affect Twilek didn't unlock until much older. They travelled the Varisian deserts and plains, usually stopping in villages or towns or camping close to Shoanti tribes for safety without interfering and angering them. Lily was an entertainer by trade as well, adept in a multitude of performances whereas Jard provided for the family as a travelling merchant, able to buy most supplies and hunting or crafting whatever else.Twilek was the second son, 5 years after Imiko and 2 before his sister Irlana and another 3 years before twin brothers Radu and Nicu. All of them shared their rust-brown hair yet their eyes were all different, apart from the twins' grey irises. It was impossible to tell Radu from Nicu and they enjoyed pulling pranks and blaming it on the other.Life on the road was hard and after the twins were born the family was forced to settle to manage. The closest town friendly to halflings was Korvosa. Imiko was completely enthralled by the ships and inspired by the halflings who crewed them. When Twilek was 12, Imiko left on his first voyage, bringing back meagre savings to support the family. This continued for two years, until the day they received the terrible news that Imiko had turned to piracy. All of a sudden, the family was ostracized by everyone they knew and business quickly dried up. It took every last favour his parents had in the city to leave the city on board a ship for Magnimar.***Magnimar was not welcoming either. Life in Underbridge was harsh and cheap; Twilek witnessed muggings and other crimes on a weekly basis. He shut it out of his mind by visiting the monuments that gave the city its title and recklessly climbing the crumbled arch bridge. The awe he felt looking directly at history overcame all other thoughts. Arrested for the umpteenth for trespass, one day a curious scholar noticed what she thought was a child in the cells and decided to talk to Twilek. Noting his interest in the ancient artefact, she revealed she was an agent of the Pathfinder Society and paid the pittance for his bail. She led him to the Heidmarch Manor, which acts as one of many staging points for the society, and the centre of all missions into Varisia. As the centre was being repurposed from a home to a lodge, much work had to be done and he was given the mundane task of re-scribing the ancient books brought in from Absalom. So he learned as he recorded, returning day after day in the evenings, poring over books on every and any topic and earning a few silver in the process.***One day he was rerecording a table of all the previous pathfinders. ""This record,"" Twilek grabbed the attention of his newfound tutor. ""The last name is my mother's and the first name is mine!""The tutor raised her eyebrows as she walked over and looked at the record, reading aloud despite the archaic font of the writing, ""Twilek Sigani - Halfling - Trap finding, minor evocation - 4588AR to 4603AR - Venture Lieutenant- MIA after black dragon collapsed tunnels at site 5F2... I'm so sorry you had to read that. Reading records like this at your age...""A Venture Lieutenant! No wonder exploring is in your blood. Such a prestigious position... there will surely be another book about him. Maybe you should cross reference the site code and go from there.""Twilek had been told he was named after an uncle on his mother’s side, he never dreamt of something like this! He immediately did as he was told, ordering in chronicles of the site in Ustalav, specifically an ancient temple to Lamashtu, evil god of monsters. According to the books, the black dragon was an expected complication, but they didn't expect it to be as old and large as it was. Only two survived of the group of five. The survivors' records depicted various horrors both as frescoes on the walls and combating the very same in the corridors. This immensely excited Twilek rather than scaring him off and as he continued his work he also met with a few high-ranked pathfinders as the months passed.***However, Twilek's enjoyment was eclipsed by the harshness of life for his family. His father's store had been robbed twice and the other kids were housebound for fear of the outside. After just 8 months in town, the Gronleafs were on the road again, following the coast up to Sandpoint. Finally, a place they could be accepted and live freely! Except... many people in town already knew of Imiko the pirate. And so the family were confronted by the sheriff.The rest of the family stood against the back wall of The Hagfish as Jard stood defiantly against the sheriff, his small size juxtaposed against the built man.""The people of Sandpoint won't wait to hear this,"" the sheriff said. ""The family of the famous Imiko Gronleaf here in town.""""Don't you mean infamous?"" quizzed Nicu from the back. The sheriff let out a hearty bellowing laugh. ""Not at all! Why he's among the best things that have happened to the town! Without his generous donation, my guards would be starving! But see them now in their imported armour and uniforms!""With that all the patrons in the inn applauded enthusiastically, and the family was accepted into the town quickly. They moved into a vacant house on Frog Alley (behind 17), and all commenced working, the kids taking apprenticeships. Two months later, they were relieved to meet Imiko in port after such a long time, yet he yearned for the sea and its adventures, leaving a small fortune for them and the town, apologising for not being with them and stating that he was a man now. Jard accepted this as Lily cried, but they all came to terms with it eventually.***The years dragged on and Twilek had good relations with Sheriff Hemlock, argued with Brodert Quink, conversed with Chask Haladan and listened attentively to Mayor Deverin's adventure stories on the rare occasion. Then the town experienced the Late Unpleasentness, the Gronleaf family grieving with everyone else, but luckily unscathed. During the rebuilding process, Twilek was called back to Magnimar for training with the Pathfinders and from there, sailed a long way to the Grand Lodge of Absalom. Surrounded by new experiences, purple and knowledge, his entire year in training went by like a flash to him. Numerous tests, challenges and missions later, he emerged victorious and a full-fledged society agent ready for adventure! ***With the bounties of the City at the Centre of the World at his disposal, he prepares himself a wagon to live in permanently, painting it brightly in blue with a red roof and stashing adventuring gear inside. Sailing back to Magnimar, upon his return he hears of the opening ceremony that same day and only stays at the lodge to report in before heading back to Sandpoint."9/30/2017 6:56:39,Kuros,Human,Monk,9/30/2017 14:36:07,Stormthorn,Cleansed Blight,Rogue,"A Cleansed Blight warrior who found purpose in defending his tiny town.

She'll stand up for herself but has trouble asking for help when she needs it. While Nerys doesn't have trust issues, it takes a lot to become close with her; she's cordial with the group, but keeps them at an emotional distance (I said cordial, not friendly). She knows she's a good fighter but relies on that too heavily to ""prove"" herself to others - she feels like she needs to show she's worth keeping around to the people she travels/trains with, which feeds into her focus on combat, the thing she's best at. Her cool, distant attitude towards others is sourced in part from her tendency to overthink relationships & social situations - she takes a ""good"" approach to interaction, but leaves people feeling like she just wants things from them, and isn't interested in becoming friends, etc.Nerys comes from a large forest region with several distinct elf communities - deer elves, fox elves, etc. While each is independent and distinct, there is comingling among them, and elves from different areas frequently travel between them. Deer elves, being sharp sensed (good hearing, smell, etc.) and lithe, are known for archery prowess. Nerys had little interest in this from a young age, however, and instead studied swords & magic. This made her a bit of a pariah in her home community, with only her family sticking by her (though there was tension at times). Other deer elves felt that Nerys' style of fighting was brutish and sadistic, and community members avoided her. This, combined with her desire to see the world outside the forest, resulted in her deciding to become a lone traveler, studying fighting by seeking out people to observe & learn from.Nerys likes the excitement of battle & the pleasure of winning a competition (her distant nature belies her competitiveness), and she likes observation and strategizing. Fighting feeds into all of that. "10/5/2017 7:11:56,Tecla Moldovite,Half-elf,Bard,"My real name is Theodas Mecla. But that's a secret. As is the rest of my story.Raised in a human village. My elven father hung around for a while, but underlying tension with the townsfolks finally chased him away. That was 50 years ago. No siblings.Mom and I worked as tinkers. We weren't destitute, but there was never anything extra. I've always hunted and scrounged to make life easier.For living in a small town, I'm well educated. When I was much younger, my mother put me in touch with teachers, so I learned some history and have always liked to read and write. I don't know what my mother had to do to get me these lessons. I don't want to know.Being exposed to these people with some class, ever since my lessons ended, I have hung around them when I could (which was rare) and snuck around to be near them when I wasn't supposed to. I watched their social events and was fascinated by the music. I'd hum along, up in a tree, behind a hedge, climbing the rooftops. Eventually I worked up the nerve to steal a viol. I'd go out into the foothills to practice, but apparently didn't go far enough. The constable confronted me at home after someone heard me playing and recognized the stolen instrument. My mother fought with him and I fled. (I don't know what happened to her. Maybe I don't want to know.) I panicked. I was sure this was a disaster and, um, maybe I overreacted. I ran through back alleys and broke into a few shops, where I grabbed a few weapons, some clothing, and some supplies, then headed out. I traveled for about a month, trying not to attract notice.A week ago I arrived here in Celia, tired and hungry.

During the robbery, I laid eyes upon the tome. Something about it stole my interest to the exclusion of all else. As I approached the tome I began to hear whispers in my mind. Upon touching the tome, time itself seemed to stand still. A bright light appeared and a voice of power proclaimed that I had been chosen; that I would be instrumental it plans.The light offered me a pact, if I would bind myself to its will, it would grant me great knowledge and power. Being a simple street urchin, the idea of power was enticing.

None of my co-conspirators were anywhere in sight. I had no idea just how long I had been standing there, but the sounds of clamouring footsteps suggested I should be on my way with great haste. I managed to escape the nobles house, but not before being spotted and recognised, by the city watch. I spent the next few days escaping the city and haven't been back since.The tome whispers to me often, mostly just beyond comprehension. Sometimes the whispers continue into my dreams, showing me secrets that evaporate when conciseness returns the next day.

Why am I here? How the hell did that happen? Does this smell like chloroform to you?  Unfortunately for Duane Choquette, the GM who will be putting Lola through the Curse of the Crimson Throne, the fine line that divides truth and fiction gets a bit hazy in Korvosa.How Lola was initially sold into slavery appears to be a matter of some debate.  Respectable sources have provided several equally plausible explanations, the validity of which have been debated with academic vigor.  There is credible truth to the rumor that Lola talked her own parents into selling her for the sum of 18 coppers and a bag of tricks. It was a pretty good deal by halfling standards.  However, equally plausible is the explanation that a Chelaxian beekeeper found her stuffed in an apiary at the age of 12.  Lola may also have been part of an experimental halfling breeding program to reduce the cost of slaving expeditions. Unfortunately, the program was scrapped when it was discovered that the halfling work ethic gene was inextricably connected to an increased dependency on sardines, which anyone with half a brain knows are prohibitively expensive in Cheliax.  The breeding program was deemed financially unsustainable, and the Chelaxian state returned to the economically sound practice of kidnapping.It is likely that Lola escaped from the dreaded Chelaxian Turnip Pits through circumstances both mysterious and brilliant.  There may have been a situation involving a particularly lucky set of dice, a tribe of Mwangi cannibals, and a feat of diplomacy that ended with the slavers in a very bad position.  Unless you were a Mwangi cannibal.  In a comparatively likely account, a forged application, a misplaced mailbag and a judicious dose of whiskey produced a foreign exchange program that resulted in a Chelaxian halfling named Nigella landing in Varisia, and a somewhat disappointed Shoanti exchange student named Mofongo who later wrote a strongly worded letter about the quality of dormitories at the Chelaxian Turnip Pits.  It is also entirely possible that Lola smuggled herself out of the Turnip Pits disguised as a pack of wild dogs.  Reliable sources stipulate that three halflings dressed as a Calistrian concubine supposedly arrived in Korvosa aboard the Dread A’tuin.  Lola had the misfortune of playing the left leg.  If you were not already aware, it is extremely difficult to ride sidesaddle as three halflings wearing one yellow toga.  The logistics can be somewhat distressing. The standard explanation includes an exuberant sea captain known as Roberts.  If the stories are to be believed, Lola was swallowed whole by a whale halfway across the Arcadian Ocean.  She purportedly survived off of hard tack and the barnacles growing along the creature’s esophagus.  Only her mastery of the fabled Brown Note saved Lola from certain digestion, and placed her, somewhat odoriferously, in the Korvosan harbor. Credible accounts have also indicated that Desna herself brought Lola to Korvosa on a chariot, dropping the halfling off with three gold, 50 silver and a mandate to do something anywhere but Taldor.  Incidentally, you never want to be Nigella in Taldor.There is undeniable proof that Lola was chased by anywhere between 15 and 74 men in bath towels down Dyer’s Row.  Eyewitness accounts of the incident vary.  Apparently, this may have been due to Lola’s theft of a debutante’s virginity through unintentionally unique methods.  In fact, the young lady’s misfortune at Lola’s hands - or feet, if the rumors are correct - was due to a well-placed kick so impressively forceful that the Korvosan heiress in question suffered irreparable damage to her reputation. That is, at least, if we are to take the word of El Pompador Churrasco, philanderer extraordinaire.  Other viable explanations have implied a connection to the Laundress, a serial vandal who struck communal baths in Korvosa over a period of two and a half years.  Conservative political scholars have suggested that the Laundress may actually have been a radical member of the Elven People’s Front.  Debates are ongoing.  A third hypothesis suggests a case of unfortunate timing.  On the day in question, no less than twenty-six complaints were filed with the Brothel Owners’ Oversight Bureau citing misrepresentation of Calistrian concubines who turned out to be three male dwarves in a trenchcoat.  The bureau’s monthly meeting dissolved into riots when the coat check caught fire.“And that’s how I ended up getting chased by the guys in bath towels down Dyer’s Row.  Then I ran into you, and we ended up here.” said Lola, polishing off Diego’s third beer.  He hadn’t actually drunk any of this one.  Or the previous two.  Diego paused to wipe down the mug with a murky dishrag before asking “But who is Duane?”"10/11/2017 1:45:02,Draghard,dwarf,warrior,A great and powerful dwarf running from home destroyed by orc!10/13/2017 6:58:07,Deipho Rolsiri,Half-elf,Rogue / Cleric,"Born and raised as part of a secretive order of assassins dedicated to “The Blessed One,” a good of death.

He didn't feel any particular affiliation with Bes, but Bes seemed like the sort of god who was chill and wouldn't mind someone worshiping him for fun.Tezelin's plan worked splendidly until Bes appeared to him in a dream and told him to go out adventuring, on the grounds that ""if you're worshiping me to amuse yourself, you should at least amuse me back"". Tezelin wasn't exactly thrilled by the idea, but it's hard to say no to a god who's providing you with magical powers, especially when said god can and will pester you in your dreams until you do the thing.Tezelin isn't really sure what he's supposed to be doing, so he's kind of just falling in with the first group of adventurers he finds and hoping for the best.

A rare pair, the human and orc truly loved each other and wished to raise their child together. Unfortunately, one evening while her father was at the market, he set her down to inspect a fruit sellers merchandise and forgot by the time he was done. He didn't realize what he'd done until after he'd returned home. Her mother questioned where he'd put her. In his backpack perhaps? Among the pears? Panic quickly set in and they rushed back to the market. They searched and searched but Rhokimira was nowhere to be found. Her parents would never see her again, instead wondering day to day what terrible fate must have befallen their child. Did she fall from the barrel and drown in the sewer? Was she kidnapped? Will she be raised in slavery? These were questions they would never answer.However, the truth of Rhokimira's fate takes a quite different tone. Shortly after her father left the stand, a passing elf named Lurias would see her sleeping form. Lurias was a very intelligent elf, learned in many forms of science, history, and magic, and he was quite aware how half-orc children were frequently abandoned by their parents out of disgust or hatred. He also had a large heart and knew that he could not leave this child to die in the market place. Gently, he took her from her perch and carried her home, whispering assurances all the while.It was with Lurias that Rhokimira, now bearing the nickname 'Kimi,' would grow. Living with the nomadic elves within their forest, she believed completely that she was also an elf, and a young one at that. Her adoptive father, while very bright, was also quite scatterbrained and overlooked the vast gap in lifespans between their races. Though she was much taller than the elves her age, she would play with them and learn with them, leaving her mental age at about 6 years old by the time she turned 21. Though she was young in her villages eyes, she was strong and insisted on following her father on his trips into nearby towns. Knowing how the roads could be dangerous, Lurias decided to teach her some of what he knew as a magus and a spelldancer. Under his careful eye she learned how to wield swords and axes in defense of herself and her family. At the same time she would learn dances and songs to strengthen her body and spell casting. The more she learned of the performing arts and magic, the more she learned to weave them together to the benefit of those around her. With Lurias and her village, Kimi was happy.When she was 18, however, she was lost again. On a visit to new town, Kimi and her father became separated in the crowd. Once she realized she couldn't see her father, she began to panic and cry. Desperate to find her father, she nearly knocked over a bard who'd been playing for tips on the side of the street. The half-elf, Rhea, was startled by the large crying woman, but held her ground and demanded an apology. Kimi immediately sobbed out an apology and an explanation of what had happened, begging Rhea to help her find her father. The woman in question was taken aback at the force of the apology and the tearful request, but took to comforting the larger woman and agreed to help. Learning that Kimi's father was, in fact, and elf was a surprise, as was her mental age, but Rhea resolved not to press and moved on. They searched the streets for several hours, but the crowds were loud and thick they could not find Lurias. They settled in a tavern for dinner and tried to find the way back to Kimi's home so that she might find her father there, but the elven village had moved only recently and Kimi had never been the best at geography. When they left to try and find the path they unknowingly left in the opposite direction. The two women found themselves hopelessly turned around come nightfall having attempted to follow a path through unfamiliar woods with the hope that it was simply a very new path to the elven village. They made camp and Rhea found herself once again comforting the scared and lonely half-orc. By morning they'd concocted a plan.They'd go on an adventure! With Rhea's street smarts, Kimi's swordsmanship, and their combined musical talent, they could go anywhere and find anyone they wanted to! And so they set off, travelling for several years and adopting each other as their new sister. While Rhea would occasionally have Kimi act as the unknowing distraction to some of her less-than-lawful activities, She cared for her and made sure that the two of them would be comfortable and happy through their travels. Though they wouldn't find her father, they kept looking as they performed from town to town.

Despite his strength, he was never assertive or vicious enough to rise through the ranks, and was picked on by those of higher status. Though he didn’t realize it consciously at the time, this was in part because his slowly developing psionic powers allowed him a slight degree of telempathy. As an unusually nice gnoll he was disturbed both by the psychic emanations of the evil gnolls and his own instinct that they were not like him.One day, a Bloodfang raiding band attacked a group of adventurers, taking heavy losses but killing most of them and capturing one, a paladin of Pelor. It was decided that as recompense for the gnolls his party killed he would be sold into slavery the next time a slaver caravan came by, which it generally did about once a month. However, Doryc sensed something of a kindred spirit in this paladin, known as Sir Gerard.For about a week after Gerard’s capture, Doryc would sneak over to where he was kept to talk with him and offer a share of his food. Seeing both his kindness and the fact that he didn’t read as evil, Gerard became friends with Doryc and told him stories of his adventuring days. He talked about how close he felt to his companions, and spoke with fondness and almost paternal protectiveness about his party’s sorcerer. His role in combat was to keep her safe while she cast the mighty spells that won them the day. She was based fairly heavily on Nylin from the Shaldar campaign.After several days of interaction, Doryc decided that he couldn’t stand to see his new friend sold into slavery.  He and Gerard hatched a plan to escape. Because most of the low-status gnolls (like Doryc) got stuck with guard duty regularly, he would have a chance to free Gerard during the night when most of the gnolls would be asleep. Their plan worked perfectly, right up until the two of them were on their way out with most of Sir Gerard’s gear. By sheer awful luck, the one free survivor of Gerard’s old adventuring band chose that night to try and rescue Sir Gerard from the gnolls himself. When he couldn’t find Gerard, he panicked, and ended up waking up enough of the gnolls to sound the alarm. Gerard, realizing what had gone wrong, insisted on running back to save his old friend, and when Doryc tried to restrain him he broke Doryc’s nose getting free. Doryc ran back trying to save him, but arrived too late, and found both Gerard and his friend dying. With his last breath, Gerard urged him to run, take his holy symbol and find Gerard’s old friend Malkorak. Half-blinded by tears, he did.Though it took him several weeks of searching, he eventually managed to track down Malkorak and tell him what had happened. Fortunately, Malkorak scanned him with detect evil and found that he didn’t show up, otherwise Doryc’s lack of tact and poor explanation might have gotten him killed."11/2/2017 13:37:36,Martigan,Human,Barbarian,"After falling in love with the thane’s daughter, Martigan is exiled from her homeland when she refuses to kill the child of a rival ruler.

He had another older brother, but Reed died when Asher was 4 and Reed was 7. Asher doesn’t know the details; all he remembers is Reed being there one day, and then being gone the next. He remembers tears and being sent to his Uncle Rowan’s place more frequently and for longer periods of time. Reed had been kidnapped and subsequently killed in a plot to take his family’s estate. Afterward, Asher’s family was never quite the same.Before, Asher had been pampered and spoiled. After Reed’s death, he found himself either sent to Uncle Rowan’s or pushed aside so his family could take care of business. The twins, distant before, seemed equally less likely to take care of him and infuriated whenever he didn’t take anything seriously. His parents were more withdrawn, seeming only to talk to him when he did something wrong. But despite of that, there was always someone watching him, even if a hired guard. Asher found the combination of the constant guard and his family’s silence stifling. In fact, the only place he truly felt free was at Uncle Rowan’s. Even as he got older, he was still under guard (sometimes even without his own knowledge, which always ended in argument).Asher didn’t like to say that he left home on a negative note, but he wouldn’t say that he left on good terms. His father fell ill a few years before he ventured on his own, and his mother became preoccupied with caring for him.

The day before he left, Asher had argued with his brother on responsibility, with his brother accusing him of never helping the family (something which Asher insisted he tried but was always turned away).

They decided to raise her among them in their isolated monastery rather than let her die.  As she grows, she has a recurring nightmare about an impeding disaster that would destroy a city.  As she grows, they get more intense.  After talking with the monks, they realize her nightmare is actually a vision.  To stop the disaster from happening, she sets off on a journey to find the city from her vision and protect it."11/6/2017 22:31:16,Sevash,drow,barbarian,"Sevash's people inhabited a harsh, desert realm. They were nomadic, moving from oasis to oasis, city to city, their unrooted lives preventing much in the way of solid government. They were divided into clans that competed or went to war with each other as often as they worked together. Sevash's father, Tehebash, led his clan to great glory, becoming a powerful warlord. He eventually united most of the clans to fight a war against an elven kingdom, carving out a clear and lasting territory for the clans to live and work on. As a result, Sevash was essentially a prince to this new kingdom. He was sent to receive an urbane education in the northern cities, but he returned to the kingdom torn by strife. His father clung to power, but his uncles and other usurpers were all vying to control the kingdom. Along with his northern schooling, Sevash had been well-trained in combat by his father, using the ehl-herkar style of fighting, in which one gives in to the rage of battle, harnessing it to achieve great physical feats. Sevash excelled in this style of combat, yet he considered himself above it by virtue of his schooling. He wanted to bring the kingdom into a more sophisticated future, leaving what he saw as primitive tribal ways behind. When he did let the rage sweep over him, afterward he carefully combed his white hair and stitched any rends in his fine garments, seeming embarrassed by his own barbaric nature. He is constantly in conflict between his warrior heritage and his educated side, and has not yet figured out how to integrate the two halves of his life."11/6/2017 22:39:54,Smok,human,bard,"Smok is a small, wiry man with an awkward, crooked face. He's not especially strong or athletic, and in fact is rather clumsy. The one thing he's good at is making people laugh. He joined a group of Blue Banner warriors fighting in the War of the Nine Clans, and soon found himself promoted from cook to mascot. His ability to revive the morale of the soldiers after a defeat, keep them smiling on a hard march, or even whip them into a fervor just before a battle became far more valuable to the company than any combat skills Smok may have been lacking. He proudly declared his nickname as company mascot to be ""Smok,"" which in his native language means ""dragon."" However, it is also used as a slang word for ""penis."" Smok knows this, and the other soldiers do as well, so they often ride into battle with cries of, ""We never fight without our Smok!"" with Smok singing a ribald song utterly out of tune. During battles, Smok often uses his wit to shout jibes at the enemy, affecting their morale and inciting them to make ill-considered decisions. Indeed, in one famous incident, Smok shouted insults at an orc captain, who grew so angry he accidentally choked on his own tongue. Smok had mocked him TO DEATH.

However, he wracked up a huge debt while learning magic and had to flee his homeland. Now he adventures as an unassuming wizard of moderate power and an outsized ego."11/11/2017 14:48:39,Geirolf,Human,Paladin,"At the age of 15, Geirolf left his farming home in a small village in the kingdom of Bergenwald to join a mercenary company, lying about his age. The Whitestone Company accepted him, and he trained as a spearman in their infantry. For two seasons, they fought against orcish incursions from the northeast, and he distinguished himself enough to advance to the rank of squad leader, then Sergeant. In his third campaign year, the company was hired by Duke von Schoenbeck, one of the Dukes of Bergenwald, to hold his border against a Duchess with whom a dispute had broken into open fighting. Two of the company's three field cohorts  were tasked with guarding the Duke's own city and its surrounds from encroachment by the opposing Duchess, while the third, including Geirolf, was assigned to garrison the Blackwolf Fort, which guards a pass leading into the Duke's lands. The fort was assaulted by another mercenary company, Damian's Dragons, hired by the opposing Duchess, with vastly superior force. After holding out for four days, the captain in charge of the cohort surrendered the fort to the Dragons, who treated the Whitestone soldiers honorably. Those who gave their parole—their binding word not to resist the occupation of the fort by the other mercenary company—were permitted a great deal of freedom in and around the fort, though no weapons beyond a dagger. A few weeks into the occupation, another force was spotted approaching the fort. It proved to be the Sand Scorpions, a third company with a much more brutal reputation.  Duke von Schoenbeck had hired them to take his fort back...and when, after a few days, the captain of the Dragons met with the captain of the Scorpions under flag of parley to discuss surrender terms, he and his guards were slaughtered, in violation of the Code all three companies were sworn to adhere to. A long and bloody siege followed, in which the Dragons and the Whitestone Company fought side-by-side against the Scorpions. With both companies manning the defenses, the fort was too tough to break, but it wasn't long before supplies began to run out...especially when the Scorpions began using magic to ruin them from afar. After two months of siege, the defenders agreed they needed to get word out about the situation, and the Whitestone Company was closest. Geirolf and a half-dozen other men and women volunteered for a perilous mission to sneak past the besieging army and reach Duke von Schoenbeck's city with the news. Four survived the breakout, and were pursued relentlessly by squads of the Scorpions. By the time they reached the Whitestone outer pickets, only Geirolf and Adya, a woman from the Dragons, remained, and both were injured and feverish. Before they could deliver their message, the tenacious Scorpion pursuers caught up to them, and the Whitestone sentries died fighting them. The two continued on, but were set upon by the last two of the Scorpions within minutes. They were forced to stand and fight, and Adya gave her life to protect Geirolf. He wears her armband even now in her memory and that of all the honorable Dragons who fought and died beside Whitestone soldiers. Geirolf continued to the inner perimeter of the Whitestone camp, where he was recognized and taken to the infirmary tent. There, he gave his message to the company's commander, Elisa Whitestone, who gave the order then and there to start packing up the camp and heading west to Blackwolf Fort.The siege was broken and the Scorpions slaughtered, almost to the man, but all that remained of the defenders were a scant few dozen men and women, malnourished and demoralized.Geirolf was given the Company's highest decoration, and given a place at Commander Whitestone's side when she confronted Duke von Schoenbeck. The orders found in the possession of the Scorpions showed clearly that he had ordered them to kill every member of the Whitestone Company who had participated in the surrender, a direct violation of the contract he signed with them. However, he refused to pay—both the penalty fees for breach of contract and the original contract price, saying that by surrendering the fort, then leaving his city, they had forfeited anything he had agreed to (despite there being clauses in the contract for that express purpose).For this, the Mercenary Code has a clear answer: the Duke was blacklisted for life from ever being able to hire a bonded company again. Furthermore, the Whitestone Company's two remaining field cohorts sacked the Duke's city (mainly the Ducal palace) to make up for the pay he refused to give. Naturally, the Duchess he was feuding with also took ample advantage of the opportunity to take the territory she wanted from him.During the sack of the city, an important incident occurred. Behind a false wall in a warehouse belonging to the Duke, a squad Geirolf was leading discovered a hidden basement that had clearly been used to worship Tiamat, which is a capital crime in Bergenwald. Geirolf quickly pulled the squad out, replacing the false wall, and sought advice from his captain. That advice was to call on the local temple of Bahamut (which they had carefully avoided disturbing in the sack, along with the other temples) to see if they had anyone there who could ensure that the place was made safe for people of good will again. They were fortunate enough that the temple had a dragonborn paladin named Emidhaar resting there on her way through the land, and the next day, Geirolf's squad returned with her to the hidden basement.This time, they surprised a meeting of Tiamat's worshipers in progress, and a terrifying fight ensued. Geirolf had never before seen a clash of magics such as this, and was astounded by the paladin's ability to protect him and his squad from the curses thrown their way by the dark priest. With her aid, they slew the priest and the most obstinate of his followers, took the rest prisoner, and cleansed the evil taint from the place.To Geirolf, the Whitestone Company was never the same after that season. Most of his close friends had been killed in the siege, and his view of the Dukes who were effective rulers of Bergenwald had changed from one of somewhat petty but ultimately harmless distant figures to one of malicious overlords willing—even eager—to sacrifice anyone they viewed as beneath them if it served their ends...or just amused them.He served with the Company for another season, and in between seasons accepted a promotion to and training as an officer. He also began training in more individual combat styles, using a glaive instead of a spear. However, he was no longer able to fully commit to fighting for someone else's gain, and by the end of the season, he requested, and was granted, an honorable separation from the Company. Commander Whitestone herself told him that if he ever wanted a position within the Company again, he had only to ask for it: he would be made a full Lieutenant on the strength of his performance in that last season.After leaving the Company, he sought out Emidhaar, the dragonborn paladin of Bahamut who had aided him and his squad against the Tiamat-worshipers. She was not hard to find, as such people are not common, and provoke comment. However, it took him three months to catch up with her.Once he did, he first asked her if he could become her squire, but she said she did not wish a squire at this time—frankly, she told him that he would get in the way of what she had to do. However, upon understanding his deep desire to be able to protect people the way she did, she did agree to allow him to travel with her for a month and a half. That would take them to a major temple of Bahamut, and allow her to train him in the basics of both Bahamut's worship, and what it meant to be a paladin. If he still wished to follow that path when they reached the temple, he could stay there and they could finish his instruction. If not, he could depart and find his own way.By the time they reached the temple, Geirolf was only more certain that this life was what he sought. He spent the next few months there, practicing both his martial skills and his devotion to Bahamut and His ideals."11/12/2017 0:47:54,Caleb Tierce,Halfling,Rogue,"Caleb was born in a small town in the subterranean country of Heimgaar, to Jarrett Tierce and Silvana Langston.

Thanks to Nera's latent magic, she and Caleb just barely managed to escape the disaster, though this event left Caleb with an intense phobia of water.Trekking through the underground with the few other survivors, Caleb and Nera were eventually taken in by their maternal aunt Beatrice, along with her wife, a dwarf named Olena, who lived in one of Heimgaar's larger cities.Beatrice began to teach the siblings in various skills as they grew; Caleb was tutored as a scribe and linguist, while Nera got further training in magic from her aunt, who used to be an adventuring wizard. However, Caleb was still a mischievous child, and would often sneak out after dark to explore the wider city.Eventually, around the time that Nera was getting ready to depart to the surface on her own adventure, Caleb's exploring caught the eye of a local mercenary, Dask Rellos (an ex-evil cult member and assassin who used to be an adversary to Caleb's aunts, but has since mellowed), who took him on as an apprentice and began training him in various rogue skills.Some years later, after most of his rogue's apprenticeship had been completed, Caleb received a letter from his sister encouraging him to come visit her on the surface, thus leading to the start of his own journey."11/12/2017 11:28:25,Finn McCool,Human,Barbarian,"Finn is the eldest son of the McCool clan, a minor noble family.

Until she discovered alcohol whilst working as a Soldier. Despite not loving the way it tasted, she was frequently bored and would drink for the sake of it. Unfortunately, having a love for breaking things resulted in awfully destructive behaviours, especially when drunk. This lead to Kava being exiled from her town and family and, to this day, she doesn't know if her parents are alive or not. Whilst wandering in the wilderness drunk and alone she found a group of adventures who were, at first, worried at the sight of such a rare being, then accepted her into their group. After several years of travelling with this group, on the eve of their 10th year together, she suddenly realised she hadn't touched a drop of alcohol since she joined them. When she mentioned this, and that she wanted to know why she had started drinking, to the wizard who had sent them on so many journeys as a group, he sent her to see a friend of his who could allow her to uncover any lost memories. It was only at this time Kava uncovered that, while training to be a Soldier, she had not only been abused verbally and physically as part of her training, but sexually, by almost all the Officers training her. Kava had always known her promotion to Officer had come as a surprise at the time. The wizard's friend also helped her uncover short flashes of memories of torturing and murdering the Officers who had abused her. It was hard to tell if she had done this over some time or in one mad night. After these revelations, she remained tight lipped on the subject for several more years, never allowing any of her adventurer's group to know anything of her sessions with the wizard's friend.

She's five foot six, with a long tail, four feet long.She was orphaned at a young age--so young that she barely remembers her parents. The only thing she has left of them is her mother's holy symbol--a token left over from the Adarre society. Kethra herself is apathetic towards the gods, though she often clutches the symbol when she feels frightened or nervous--or perhaps just needs a bit of a courage boost.The streets were an unforgiving place. You either learned how to survive, or you died. It was here that Kethra learned the roguish abilities that allowed her to survive, and eventually become an adventurer worth joining the Wasteland Foxes. In addition to the roguish abilities of sleight of hand; insight; deception; persuasion; and acrobatics, Kethra also became a light sleeper who could fall asleep nearly anywhere and a knack for squeezing into tight spaces.Even now, her upbringing leaves its mark. She refuses to be separated from her supplies, keeping them close, always. She detests having less than twenty gold on her person. She hates leaving places where she has steady supply of food; medicine; and/or shelter. Her place in the world taught her the worth of words, and how much it can mean to be shown kindness--or even just a bit of respect. It also taught her how fast, and how easily, things could change.Perhaps the most prominent mark left on her is her inability to trust. It wasn't always this way. When she was young, she met a fellow urchin named Lia Anskuld--a Salma half-elf. The two worked together to ensure they had ample food and medicine, and took turns on watch to ensure they got sleep. They developed a bond of sisterhood they promised would last forever.But when Kethra was sixteen, Lia betrayed her. Kethra managed to evade prison?or perhaps served her time. Now, she seeks answers. She wants to know why Lia betrayed her… and whether it was worth it. And perhaps, when it's said and done, she might want revenge.(She might also like to discover the fate of her parents.)Despite her lack of trust, deep down, Kethra dearly wants a family--as most orphans do."11/26/2017 11:26:06,Kurbo Blaensworthy,Ghostwise Halfling,Grave cleric,"I was washed ashore onto an island and found by my friend-now-stepsister who brought me into a church where I grew up.

If she is not exploring the forest, Borba is in the company of Sir Gregory, her best friend and ex-paladin from the Order. Fascinated with the tales of his life as a paladin, Borba requests that her old friend teach her how to become one too. Under his tutelage, Borba undergoes rigorous paladin training and learns how to heal wounds and wield a halberd. One day, her typical training session goes awry because Borba got distracted with the fantasy of her parents returning. Sir Gregory berates her for this, causing her to run deep into the forest to cry. Lost in her emotions, Borba fixates on the thought of being abandoned forever by her parents. This triggers her innate Orc bloodlust, causing her to wreck havoc on the trees around her. She passes out from the exhaustion of it all and dreams of a mystical Elk that assures Borba that her parents will not abandon her and that they are serving nature. The elk sees potential in Borba as a defender of nature and promises her that it will aid her should she venture forth to find her father. In return, Borba must protect nature and educate others on the importance of its preservation. Excited, Borba accepts the gift and takes the Oath of the Ancients. Before the dream ends, the Elk tells Borba that her necklace (a gift from her mother) will guide her way to her parents.

Using the skills that had served him so well as a child, Voss subtly brought himself to the attention of the baron. Fex recognized Voss's skills and offered him a job as one of his spies. Since then, Issachar Voss has worked as an instrument of the baron's will in Longacre, rooting out rebellion and meting out punishment as need demands. He's satisfied with the position for now, happy as long as he gets to bend others to his will while safe from reprisal — and the pay doesn't hurt either."12/6/2017 20:10:13,Allan Bellamy ,Human,Swashbuckler,"Allan Bellamy was born to a family steeped in the arts: his father was a composer whose works had been showcased at the Kintargo Opera House and his mother was an oft-featured soprano in the same venue. His older siblings — two sisters and a brother — were all virtuostic instrumentalists, well on their way to careers in the orchestra. Unsurprisingly, Allan's own artistic skills flourished in this environment. Though he was only an average singer and could never do more with an instrument than strumming chords on a lute, he was a powerful orator. He easily found a home in the Kintargo Dramatics Society, a group which performed classic plays between opera seasons. He was poised to perform his first starring role as King Haliad III, the instigator of the Everwar and a role every dramatic aspired to, when on the eve of opening, word came from Egorian that Queen Abrogail had banned any positive depictions of pre-diabolist rulers of Cheliax.Thwarted in his theatrical dreams and full of a newly-kindled hatred of the diabolist monarchy, Bellamy left Kintargo. He eventually joined a wandering band of guerilla performers who would perform brief works lauding the olden days and severely critical of the Thrune dynasty. Allan particularly distinguished himself through ridiculous performances as Queen Abrogail herself. Though they were hunted by the authorities, they managed to evade capture by never remaining in one place for very long. Friends in towns all over the Chelaxian countryside helped to shelter them between shows.On one particular night, Allan received word that there was to be a protest in Kintargo against the newly-installed Lord Mayor, Barzillai Thrune. He implored his fellow performers to hurry the show so they could be present for such a significant event. Unfortunately, as he took the stage to perform the part of the notorious Jackdaw, a hastily-knotted rope unfurled, dropping a sandbag squarely on his head. When he awoke in the home of a sympathetic audience member, the troupe was gone and his memories of his life were mixed up with the plot of the play he'd been about to perform. One thing remained firmly in his mind: he had to get to Kintargo to help incite rebellion, just as he had in the days of the Chelaxian Civil War. The Jackdaw would rise again!"12/17/2017 2:05:28,Gippy ,Elf,Wizard,"She is a trans woman and a serpent sorcerer.

On Ladardon’s 35th birthday a feast was held to celebrate his appointment as Orzammar's newest commander of the Crimson Guard. Ladardon participated in the Provings and was accompanied by Gorim Saelac, Ladardon's second and best friend. On the way through the Diamond Quarter and the Provings, Ladardon met his elder brother Trian and their younger brother Bhelen. Crown-prince Trian, the heir to the throne, had arrogantly demanded that Ladardon return to the ceremony at the throne room at once. So respectfully Ladardon attend his ceremony.  In the throne room Ladardon meet several other nobles, the King, and Kenshin Silverfire. After the ceremony Bhelen told Ladardon that Trian is plotting to kill him, because the Assembly might choose him over Trian, who ""won't step aside."" However, because of the impeding expedition, there was no time to talk to Trian. The king sent Ladardon, along with Gorim, on a special mission to retrieve the Crest of the Fireforge clan from the Fireforge Thaig. After fighting several Darkspawn encounters, Ladardon finds the chamber with the crest. However, there are mercenaries waiting to take Ladardon out. They carry with them Trian's Signet Ring. After retrieving the crest, Ladardon headed back to the meeting point, only to find Trian’s corpse eviscerated on the ground. As the Ladardon stood over Trian’s body, Bhelen and the King's party arrived. Bhelen claimed that Ladardon killed Trian to become the next Crowned-Prince. No amount of protesting convinced the Dwarven lords otherwise. As an added horror, the cocky scout and Frandolin Ivo, two other attendants, acted as eyewitnesses and vouched that Ladardon killed Trian. Ladardon was sent to the Deep Roads to die, while Gorim was banished to the surface. But Ladardon, being a skillful fighter in the arts of sword-play and lucky, was able to stumble upon Kenshin Silverfire and The Order of the Red Lotus and was recruited as a Warden-Recruit into the Order.At the Weisshaupt Fortress, Ladardon met the Grand Master as he came to greet Kenshin and his party as they entered the stronghold. After conversing with the Grand Master, Ladardon was informed of the Joining Ritual and its criteria. Ladardon after resting for the night was let into an arena filled with about a dozen or so Darkspawn, his objective was to kill the Darkspawn until he had obtained three vials of their blood. Upon accomplishing that no small feat, he was instructed to mix the blood with lyrium and drink it. The concoction was not the easiest drink to swallow and upon finishing the drink caused Ladardon to writhe in pain and experience visions of the true nature of the Darkspawn – Red Lyrium. Once the ritual was complete, Ladardon was promoted to Warden-Ensign and was taken under the mentor-ship of Kenshin, who would teach Ladardon all he knew in the manner of the sword, which could go unhindered since he was considered dead by the Kingdom. Many years passed and Ladardon progressed at a steady-rate. Ladardon rose up the ranks of the Order to the point of earning the title “Master”, he had now taken Kenshin’s command, as Kenshin had been promoted to “High Master”. He had run many operations and was a formidable fighter and had earned the respect of many of the members of the Order. He even studied the skill of smithing, and had become a formidable smith in the Order. However, he wished to earn the title of Paragon, and put his traitorous brother in his place, by finding the Dwarves greatest treasure, The Anvil of the Void, and with it craft the first ever Lyrium weapons. In order to do so he left the Safety of Weisshaupt Fortress, after gaining permission, and the underground Kingdom to find the knowledge of the location of the Primeval Thaig, knowing that Caridin, himself, had traveled outside the Kingdom to obtain knowledge for the creation of the Anvil of the Void."12/20/2017 15:54:55,Revel Junic Pharidian Baccharnale,High Elf,Fey Warlock,"Born into a noble family as the scion of a renowned candy manufacturer, Gustav Baccharnale was a quiet young man who often preferred the company of plants and books to the residents of his family's estate.

Like most gnomes living amongst their own kind, in his youth he had many names given by many people. Some stuck, some did not. For now, I’ll introduce him as the name he will come to use – Naoise ‘Zapp’ Garrick.Naoise grew up a very average forest gnome, albeit in a slightly unusual forest gnome community. In the wake of the Starstone’s cataclysmic effects on the land, this particular clan of forest gnomes had found themselves more exposed to the other races then they found comfortable. Cut off from the Sylvan elves they once knew as friends, they had formed an alliance with the halflings who lived across the plains on the edge of their forest. Needing allies to survive, the Garrick clan gnomes and the plains halflings had formed a comfortable pact – both perhaps relieved to be fighting alongside other small folk. As the land changed in the great roil the Starstone brought about, Naoise was born into a forest gnome clan whose isolated patch of woodland sat atop great cliffs and extended into the Hinterland of a sheltered bay – the remnants of the now sea-flooded plains the halfings once lived across. The halflings they called allies had founded a prosperous harbour town, with mercantile ships often taking shelter from storms, receiving repairs, or restocking their supplies in the welcoming – if pint sized - settlement.The forest gnomes stayed in the forested hinterlands so long as masts of ships could be seen in the harbour. But when the port sat empty, and no big folk were striding about the town, they would venture down to trade and talk with the halflings they befriended. Perhaps unusual for forest gnomes once, this was the status quo into which Naoise was born – but in all other ways his childhood seemed normal for one of his people. He loved animals, and would spend endless days searching out their nests and homes, returning daily to check if they were safe – sometimes stealing food from his mother’s table to feed them. Their underground home was warm and bright, and the temperate forest canopy was an above-ground labyrinth of verdant green and occasional blue sky which Naoise climbed through, gracefully as the small creatures he adventured with.His parents were loving, but Naoise was in the younger half of his 14 siblings. Never causing trouble, he was a profoundly average boy. Almost boringly so. But the gnomish zeal for life shone through him like it did all his clan, and he was content throughout his childhood and teenage years with the mostly peaceful life he thoroughly enjoyed, occasionally excited by their trips to the halfling town when no ships were docked.Naoise was 15, and never expected his unremarkably average life to change. He was content, but unknowingly on the precipice of a great change. It was a late summer night, and a fierce storm was rolling in off the sea. The first-of-the-season thunder boomed and heavy rain beat against the gust-battered leaves of the forest. Naoise didn’t know what spell drew him out of his burrow that night – although the wise will recognise fey enchantments when they hear of them. In the thrall of a powerful fey creature, he ventured out into the storm, slowly making his way through the trees to the cliff edge overlooking a tempestuous sea. He remembers this through his own eyes, but his thoughts were alien. Standing on the verge of the cliff, waves boiling beneath him, and shaking with the peal of thunder, the fey creature appeared behind him, shrouded in bright blue light and glowing mist. He remembered facing this captivating creature, held in awe, fear and reverence – utterly enchanted. The fey held its hand against his head, and with an explosive arc of lightning he was sent spiralling unconscious into the furious seas below.Naoise first reckoned he should have died that night, although has since grown to accept that his fate was in the control of something more powerful than a simple storm. He had been hauled up at daybreak by a damaged ship, slowly creeping its way to find repair in the halfling port-town after suffering at the hands of the same storm Naoise had been drawn out to. By all rights he should have been terrified – he came-to surrounded by grizzled big folk of many races, colours, and degrees of hygiene. But traces of the fey enchantment still lingered on him, and presented with what many forest gnomes would consider a nightmare, he simply took a deep draught of the spiced liquor offered, and allowed himself to sit up. Stood far away was someone who clearly dressed as the ship’s captain – or perhaps not stood far away, but standing half the height of the other sailors. A halfling. A Captain Halfling. At the time, Naoise was still not himself. He answered simple questions, and seemed happy that they were on their way to the halfling port town. The superstitious amongst the sailors thought him a sea spirit, and thought best not to risk upsetting him for fear of ill-luck on the waves. To the rest he was a few hours amusement, and a day later he departed the ship – still fettered by the remnants of enchantment, his farewell to the Captain was as simple as if he were saying goodbye to his mother before she left for market.It wasn’t until he had made his way home that the final echo of the fey spell which held him died away. He came back into himself whilst sat at his family burrow table, surrounded by his 14 curious and concerned siblings, tearful mother and bewildered father. He cried – finally feeling the terror that should have taken hold of him a day before. He rested for days. And when he awoke, he noticed something that his siblings had been forbidden to mention – a forelock of his strawberry blonde hair had turned brilliant white. Finally refreshed to his gnomish self, he and his family dismissed it as but a quaint quirk. They buried their concerns beneath an optimistic excitement for the adventure Naoise had experienced – and the amusing mark it had left on him.His family took the unusual step of going down to the harbour without checking for ship masts – their good-natured need to thank the ship who saved Naoise overcoming their terrified reservations of big folk. But the ship had moved on. They enquired with the dockmaster – who told them that as luck would have it, the ship was due to return in the Spring – the town had been commissioned to make some replacement parts in light of the temporary repairs the ship had been given. Whilst his parents seemed pleased to hear this, Naoise felt different. Not anxious, not excited, but vexed. He didn’t know why, but it burdened him.Months began to pass, and things began to change in Naoise. His old habits lost their appeal. The hinterland forest seemed small, the boughs of the trees less exciting to climb. His smile dropped, and amongst gnomes, this was a thing of great concern. His family thought him sick but he showed no signs of physical illness. Their worries multiplied when the strangeness started. Gusts of wind would surge through the burrow in the night. Candles were blown out. Lanterns rattled. And Naoise became more distant. He would spend hours at the edge of the cliffs staring out to the horizon, or looking up at the clouds secretly hoping for wild weather. A thought burned in him, and whilst he ignored it initially, it couldn’t be snuffed out.It was only when spring came back around that his family persuaded it out of him. They knew he had been changed that night. And when sixteen loving faces all peered down on him imploring him to share his burdens – he told them he needed to leave. He needed to be on the seas, in the winds and the rain and the salt spray. He yearned for this like nothing before – and planned when that same ship returned, to entreat the captain to take him on.A wanderlust and need for adventure is not unknown in gnomes – and whilst unusual for those in the forest – they remained very gnomish in the outlook. Excited for his experiences. Happy that there was something to be done to make him better. They all awaited the day ships would return to the harbour with nervous excitement.It was 8 months since the storm that the ship finally returned. Naoise carried out his plan, although admittedly without much planning. A day after the ship docked he asked to be let aboard – and the sailors who still thought him a sea spirit gladly obliged. He spoke with the Captain – who humoured him for a while. Naoise and his family perhaps never expected his offer to actually be accepted. A rugged crew of humans, half-orcs, and an odd wayward dwarf was no place for a gnome. Perhaps Captain Burrbough saw something of himself in this diminutive aspiring Sailor. He was a strange sort of man – full of laughter and a sense of humour which others struggled to master. Maybe the image of this tiny gnome alongside his half-orc helmsman was too humorous for him to pass up. But arrangements were made – and within two weeks, Naoise Garrick was aboard a ship on the high seas.The transformation on deckhand Garrick was profound. His gnomish love of life returned twice as strong – his grin was broad, his energy high, and his zeal for the seas near unmatched. Captain Burrbough’s vessel – the Foamrover, was a ship of exploration and trade. Many edges of the map had changed after the effects of the Starstone – and there was profit and excitement for those ships willing to re-chart the seas and trade with the newly isolated pockets of the changed world. The life seemed to suit deckhand Garrick – and he quickly grew into his role. His gnomish sight, and life living in burrows, meant that life below deck was without challenge for him. His days climbing through trees and running along boughs meant he took to the sails, ropes, and masts of the ship effortlessly. He could even entreat seabirds to lead them to land, and after they found a new island doing just that, it seemed his place on the ship was secured. Captain Burrbough liked him, the crew found him humorous. The only quirk was his white forelock – which the crew quickly deduced could predict the weather. Straight, flat, glossy meant clear skies, hot suns. A curl to the left meant rain. To the right meant wind. A corkscrew-ringlet meant both. The superstitious thought this troubling. The practical thought it useful.The only snag was the severe, unreadable First Mate – the half elf Lady Thalasstra. Her sharp features, keen intuition, guarded mannerisms and forceful presence were respected and almost feared by the crew. And Garrick had no idea what she thought of him. For all the whimsy and laughter of Captain Burrbough, First Mate Thalasstra provided a sombre counterweight. Deckhand Garrick avoided her as much as he could, but on one night during his 8th month aboard, he couldn’t avoid scrutiny any longer.Deckhand Garrick awoke in the night – the ship was anchored, but tossed around in surging waves. The seamen were arguing as to whether to hoist the anchor – but they were near shoals, and couldn’t afford to drift. Rain poured down and winds were increasingly strong. In the distance, a peal of thunder rolled across the swell. Naoise’s blood pounded in his veins – he was breathless, wracked by adrenaline and a compulsion he could barely control. He had to get above deck. The crewmen saw as he staggered passed them – noticing one thing over any other - his white forelock of hair writhing, twisting and coiling ceaselessly like the dismembered tentacle of some abyssal creature. First Mate Thalasstra heeded the nervous calls of her crew to come see – and she was greeted by a spectacle that left the crew terrified to step out onto deck. Stood amidst the storm was Deckhand Garrick – seemingly unmoved by the wind, streaks of fog rose like smoke from his skin, only to be snatched away by the fierce gusts – facing the crew, his white lock still twisted and thrashed like some wild serpent. Thalasstra stepped out towards him, but before she could get within arm’s reach, Garrick yelped and she was thrown back, sliding along the slippery deck, driven by an unnatural blast of wind. Her eyes widened, and as the hairs on the back of her neck rose away from the skin, she dived backwards. A great crash of thunder seemed to sound from the deckhand’s hands – arms outstretched either side of him as he struggled against some unseen grip. The crew had barely recovered from the shock when his hands were twisted skywards, two great arcs of lightning erupted forth into the clouds. The scene played out for the next half an hour. Captain Burrbough joined the crew in watching as the deckhand’s arms were thrown around like a puppet – bringing with them surges of wind which went unnaturally against the storm, earsplitting bursts of thunder, and flashing bolts of skyward lightning.The half hour passed, and the storm quietened. Deckhand Garrick was left prone, slumped in a pool of fog which shrouded his form. The crew were spooked, and more than one were ready to end his life there and then – thinking him cursed, that he had raised this storm. Thalasstra, however, wore a characteristically reserved expression. She promised the crew that if anyone threatened their fellow deckhand again, she would have them dragged behind the keel of the ship – and with all the grace her half-elf blood afforded her, she scooped the unconscious gnome up in her arms, and laid him down in the Captain’s Quarters.Much happened in the following weeks. Captain Burrbough and First Mate Thallastra spoke at great lengths with a terrified Naoise, under which circumstance he learned more about her than he ever thought to glean. She had been born to an elven mother, after a romance with a human sailor. She and her twin sister were raised by elves – and her twin sister showed a profound aptitude for magic. Whilst showing no inclination towards spellcraft herself, Thallastra had sat in many of her twin sister’s lessons, working on her own tutelage, and suspected that the young deckhand could be an addition to the crew unlike any other. She herself had joined the ship under similar desire to Naoise – her father’s seafaring blood nursing a need in her she could not bear to ignore – despite her education and childhood not lending itself to the sailor’s path. Captain Burrbough seemed to take this like anything else – another source of amusement for his bizarre humour, and some extra excitement to match his already exciting life.Naoise Garrick made a valuable friend that day – and under the encouragement and protection of the First Mate, and with the prompting of some beginner’s lessons she half remembered form watching her twin sister – discovered his gift could do more than forecast the weather. Years went by and with every storm, Deckhand Garrick would stand at the bow of the ship, learning to no longer fear the tempestuous power in him, but learning to evoke it. And with every step further along accepting his newfound power, his other tricks took on new life too. The ship continued exploring the changed edges of the map – and Naoise became an irreplaceable asset. A capable sailor with gnomish charm and optimism, his natural dexterity became athletic. His skin tanned, he became unusually strong (for a gnome). He loved nothing more than making new friends and meeting new people in the taverns of the towns they traded with. His magic progressed – he could mend snapped ropes or torn sails in a moment without any trace – his forest gnome illusions became the standard signals used to carry messages around the ship. The crew would eagerly await the storms to see deckhand Garrick perform a show of wind, thunder and lightning – tricks he had learned to produce even in the clearest of skies, although not with quite the same grandeur. One especially excitable young sailor started calling him Zapp, in light of his proclivity for lightning and thunder. The name grew instantly popular, and Naoise Garrick embraced the new title with a joy true to his gnome nature and their love of names.This brings up to the present day. We find Zapp decades older – a gnome of over 50 years. He remains short, lithe, and agile, but his athletic build can’t be missed under his tan sailor’s skin. The sun has kept his strawberry blonde hair light – worn pulled back into a messy braid but for his stark white forelock, which hangs loose down the side of his face. Captain Burrbough no longer sails – instead, he commands a whole fleet of merchant ships from a homely mansion not too far from the town Zapp knew as a child. Thalasstra was made Captain of the Foamrover, and unlike the rest of the now elderly Burrbough’s merchant fleet, her crew are pure explorers. They search out the remotest islands and towns into which to expand Burrbough’s trading empire. Zapp remained under Thalasstra’s wing – her initial acceptance, encouragement and mentorship proving the start of a long and powerful friendship. She made Zapp her first mate, and as a half elf in the prime of her life, leads a crew of motley explorers, all of whom revel in the magical gnome, who climbs from rope to mast, with hair which can forecast the weather.Zapp seems to be leading a fantastic life – always eager to see new towns and meet new people, although one has to wonder if deep down he has a desire to find people like him, touched with inexplicable power. He is loyal to Thalasstra, almost to a fault, but balances out her severity with his lust for life, and hearty enjoyment of ale when the crew makes landfall. He has become adept at a few spells useful on a ship, and otherwise seems naturally able to make storm-like magic. Other than that, he knows very little about his power, and perhaps now is growing curious enough at to seek out someway to develop it further."1/15/2018 9:07:39,Diana Stanley,Tiefling,Paladin,"Once a member of the Cult of Mangaia the New Moon, I discovered that the leader of the cult, Father Martin, does not believe in Mangaia, and has caused the cult prophet to suffer the backlash of defiance.

Early on, Mavis' mum ran off to ""reinvent herself"" and the re-invented version didn't have a tiny daughter, father unknown, so Mavis was raised by her gran, dead now the past couple years, who taught her the witching trade.Mavis' appearance, like her place of birth, is barely worth mentioning. She is certainly not ugly, but not beautiful either. Average enough that you would probably see her and promptly forget. If she were inclined towards a life of crime this would be useful - ""Well, officer - she was a -- person? of average height? her hair was... brown maybe...?"" In fact, her hair is the same brownish color of bathwater after child #7 has had their turn in the tub, not quite straight enough to be remarkable; her eyes are a similarly unremarkable brown and her skin, apart from having finally grown past a blemishy phase is equally average. Her bosom is on the smaller side and she has a figure that will probably settle to pear-shaped when she reaches her gran's age.Mavis, however, has an overblown belief in her own beauty, imagining that it is her loveliness and feminine charm that had all the young men of the neighborhood making indecent suggestions, rather than an ability to observe that the women of Mavis' line have had daughters but no husbands for the last few generations, and a hope that the daughter might take after the mother. Mavis has no time for the attentions of these village louts and is generally mistrustful of any man's intentions.Not long ago, the town's mayor discovered that his wife's failure to conceive was not just bad luck, but aided by an occasional potion; and that the mayor's wife had solicited this prescription to avoid the chance that her future child looked more like the innkeep than the mayor; and Mavis' hometown became much less hospitable. Mavis made clever use of a sleeping draught and ""borrowed"" a set of clothes from one of her gentleman admirers, chopped her hair off, and set out with a pack and a knife at her belt rather unconvincingly disguised as a young man (""Martin"") to seek her fortunes elsewhere.Unfortunately, Mavis has hardly any money (scraped up the bit gran had sat aside for just-in-case) as the neighborhood witch often gets paid in barter (at least she has some idea what to do with the knife, people aren't that different from goats or pigs, right? and gran taught her some very basic hand to hand combat, just-in-case - two or three ways to squirm out of someone's grasp, etc.) and very little idea of how to make it in the outside world. Besides her skills, she's got two things going for her - she has basically no other choice, and at least in Mavis' mind, she's as clever as she is beautiful (and she learned things proper, not that garbage book-learning they do in the cities to seem all high-and-mighty.)"2/9/2018 19:18:19,Yrena Fern,half-elf,thief,"I have a half-sister, six years my senior.

As his father was an elf and likely to outlive Flock, his father begged the judge to take Flock's 100 years as well as his own, so that Flock could enjoy a full and happy life. With his father imprisoned and nowhere to go, Flock drifted until he found a big city, where he lived in the fringes and alleys, until finally he found a quaint little shop selling lesser treasures. He immediately struck up a friendship with the proprietor, a fierce Minotaur lady called Feather, and set up a small-time detective agency. The shop subsequently became known as 'Flock and Feather's Emporium and Detective Agency' until the two earned the interest of the local magical authorities, who employed them as contractors."3/1/2018 12:14:21,Dorcy Redleaf,"1/16 elf, 15/16 human",Ranger,"Dorcy learned at a very young age that she could talk to animals.

The God Talkers of his village (better known in elvish as the Amanduné) had plans for Goose that would help unlock his true potential... as they had said many times in the past. Goose, wanting no part of whatever stuffy ponderings these ancient, withered, willowy, elves had in store for him, used his quickly developing power to beat a hasty escape from the ancient tree city, never to return.	On the road, Goose learned that growing up as an outsider had its’ advantages in the wider world. With his dashing good looks and quick tongue he was able to turn many situations with rough rapscallions from potential beatings into nights of merriment. Finding that beyond having a quick wit and a few parlor tricks up his sleeve, he had no real employable skills, Goose fell in with a band of Musicians, Actors, Entertainers, Storytellers, Escape Artists, Magicians, and Mercenaries known as the Wild Rovers. Being relatively green and clueless, the band of merrymakers, miscreants, and murderers taught him most of what he knows, and molded him as a person. In this band is also where he earned his famous moniker, as his attempt to perform a daring sword dance turned into a wild magic burst that polymorphed him into a goose, resulting in much leaping and honking as the animated blades twirled around him.For twenty years Goose roved the land as one of the wild bunch, womanizing, drinking, and honing his performance craft everywhere he went. But he found that no amount of liquor and laughter was able to drown out the baleful chorus resounding from within. Since he was a child, Goose had been tormented by some unknown force, that to him were simply bad dreams or perhaps the result of too much magical exertion. But no matter the rest he had or the control over his abilities mastered, Goose found these dark visions were always close at hand. Having no shape or form, he only knew the presence and the voice that occasionally penetrated the woeful din.Morohtar… Morohtar...LINGER NOT LONG. THE EVE OF ARRIVAL DRAWS EVER NIGH. HE REQUIRES YOUR PRESENCE.II. Discovery and Ruin	Around the age of 40 Goose left the Wild Rovers and set out on his own, determined to find some semblance of inner peace. He wandered from town to town, telling stories of the land  and giving various performances for spending money whenever he could. He became somewhat of a household name in the towns surrounding the capital, and after a time began to attract attention. After a rather rowdy show in the Dwarven mining encampment near the city of Oresdepth, Goose was approached by an agent of The Bard’s College nearby. Goose took the invitation as an opportunity to settle his mind and perhaps change his ways, maybe mending the chaos inside.	Goose found himself rather comfortable in the melodic atmosphere that encompassed the Oresdepth Bardic University, but the university did not seem to be as comfortable with him. Other students and bardic hopefuls knew of Flying Sword Follows Goose, but mainly as an uncouth halfbreed magician that thought himself a talented performer. Goose of course wanted only to learn himself better, and cast aside his old ways. 	Goose spent years studying the bardic ways in that place, and was soon due to graduate, he would a be a full blown bard! The final performance was at hand and Goose had prepared what he believed to be a stunning mix of magic, music, and storytelling. The headmaster called him to the stage and beckoned him to begin, in front of all his peers. A feeling of peace washed over Goose as he told his story, his past. Weaving spells into images, accompanied by a soft lute that he played. 	The hoi polloi, refusing to recognize the talent inherent in Goose, would stand no longer to let such a disgraceful excuse for a bard continue to perform. All it took was a lone voice to start the avalanche, as a small voice in the audience shouted “Down with halfbreeds!” and hurled a ball of refuse at the spellbound sorcerer, followed in suit by a wave of others. And before their eyes the gentle melody and images vanished, only to be replaced by a wild magical field that seemed to fill the room; and the slight, joyful, musician that was once Flying Sword Follows Goose was replaced the by a wrathful beaming entity of hate and destruction. With little more than a glance from Goose, a thunderous boom resounded from the glowing godlike figure, causing the close-by audience to cover and cower as the hall around them was ripped apart by a wave of pure force throwing chairs, books, chandeliers, and bards through the air. 	Seeming more like a demon from the Abyss, the jovial entertainer was no more. On ethereal black wings the spellbound entity tore a swath across the building, rending the great hall from its foundation with a simple gesture. Abyssal heat burning in his eyes, the entity’s blackened visage cracked a freakish smile, and as quickly as it came the dark entity vanished, leaving the frail body of Goose shaking on the cracked earth. The Building crumbled around him as the occupants all pointed, aghast, and ran for their lives. Beating a hasty exit Goose left his home at the University and fled the city for the East.III. The Golden Lion’s Tail	After 15 years away, hiding in the far desert city of Shabal, still haunted by the growing chorus inside, almost moreso everyday, Goose did his best to keep to himself and stifle his wanderlust; when he heard the all too familiar sound of a Northern ballad. Having lived the simple life of a street performer for many years, Goose had learned to speak the flowing native tongue of the East and had dealt with all manner of rough sellswords and fortune seekers, flowing into the city port from foreign lands. He excelled at eavesdropping and pickpocketing, becoming one with the city, and the din of livestock, horses, and northern men were a welcome sight; more purses to lift. 	As Goose watched the gleaming caravan from afar, he leapt from his roost in a garden above the city into the street below. No sooner had he adjusted his hat to the sun and shifted his belt, he heard a familiar hiss behind him. “Gooossssssse. Ssssso nice to ssssssee you here.” It was none other than the Yuan Ti Body Trader known as Utszu, a grotesque creature with the head of a snake and the body of a muscular humanoid man.	Utszu was a member of a proud and noble family of Yuan Ti, who used their might and keen senses to enslave lesser races that they had dominated and venture to the port cities to trade them to rich merchants and landowners who wanted cheap labor. Goose was no stranger to these ‘people’ and had on several occasions used a few sorcerous tricks to release the more unfortunate among the slaves right under Utszu’s nose. Although he had evaded Utszu and his patrols on many occasions, it looked like his number was finally up...	Goose saw the way this reptilian man handler leered at him and knew from prior experience that there would be trouble. The Yuan Ti were rare to encounter in these parts, but he had never met one with anything but a foul temper and an even fouler stench. “You owe me coin Gooosssssse. Thosssse ssslaves were not yoursss to take, and you will pay, with blood or gold, I do not care.” Seeing several other heavily armed reptiles behind Utszu, Goose could feel the magic inside beginning to boil up, but he kept it down and reasoned with the lizard. A bag of fine Northern treasure from the foreign caravan in exchange for the trouble he had caused. Utszu’s eye slits narrowed and he waved the sorcerer off. “Ssssundown Goossse, or we will find you.” The band of dinosaurs departed and Goose released the burning, clutched, orb in his fist.	Keeping pace with a richly adorned carriage in the massive caravan that was slowly parting the human sea of Shabal, Goose distracted the guards with wonderous illusions of Phoenixes flying and flaming dragons making circles overhead, much to the amusement of the wide eyed escort. Using this distraction Goose deftly grabbed a loose bag from the carriages luggage rack and began to drift back into the crowd, when a rough voice called out from behind him.	“You are quick lad and that was a fine trick, but you might want to put that back before the clergy has your head” Slowly turning around, Goose was met by a grizzled older man in plain travelers clothes. “Look, with skill like that I think we might be able to work something out and forget this whole situation hmm?” His thick Northern accent blew through the greying mustache that covered his entire mouth, giving him a walrus-like appearance. “The name is Halfdan and i’m the master of The Golden Lion’s Tail, this caravan you see here. And that bag you decided to swipe belongs to the Church of Bahamut, who I guarantee will NOT take kindly to theft”	Realizing that the first good thing to happen in many years may have just rolled up next to him, Goose had flashes of his life with the Wild Rovers and felt the omnipresent wanderlust boiling up inside him. A way out of the grasp of Utszu and an excuse to restart in another place... The stout man who called himself Halfdan held out his hand, “Now I don’t usually do this, but I can tell you aren’t a Shabali pickpocket here to beguile us out of a few holy symbols and a handful of tithings. Hand over the bag and come work for the caravan for a while. Then we might call it even.” 	Without so much as a word Goose thrust the bag into the burly caravan master’s hands and climbed aboard the back carriage. Onward, Goose felt that this is where he was meant to be...	"3/8/2018 6:32:03,Mun'aki,Elf,Bard,3/12/2018 8:56:01,Bridget Valhelena Ingridsdottir,Dwarf,Warrior,"Born to the Two Axe Clan of Borthfagldur, Bridget's parents had hopes for her to become an engineer and named her accordingly. But as she matured, she rebelled against her traditional upbringing and, shortly before an arranged marriage to an intelligent and conscientious architect, she ran away from home. Leaving the mountain holds, she fled to the human lands where she earned her keep through physical labour. But her brash nature and general anger with the world (and herself) pushed her from job to job, and she didn't settle down or make friends. Unable to make ends meet, she took the ceremonial axe (that she had brought with her as a memento) to sell for a bit more coin; but, mistaken for an experienced warrior, she was invited to join an adventuring party by a bypasser. Having little to lose, she accepted the offer, hoping that the decorative axe would hold out when wielded in battle. Until she has proven herself to be independently successful, her pride prevents her from returning to the hold that she misses so much; but one day she dreams of going home with glory and riches to her name, and vindicating her rash decisions as a young girl."3/12/2018 9:17:02,Temperance Gruukash,half-orc,warlock,"Raised by a cult of Jaziran during the spell-plague, he's been sent out into the work to try to gather pieces of the world-serpent to send to Jaziran in an effort to restore him to full power.

Nara left home and set off on this long journey. Along the way, she met a half-elf named Kael, who was on her own journey to become a paladin. They traveled together for almost 10 years, but parted ways when Nara reached the cave promising each other that they would meet again in the future and get married. However, she discovered that someone, or something, had gotten to the cave first. There was no sign of her mother or the magic. Frustrated but refusing to give up, Nara went to a tavern in the closest town with the intent to simply rest up until she figured out what to do next. However, in the tavern she overheard some people talking about a prestigious and brutal fighter's school nearby, Arrowhawk Academy. She decided to find the school. She attended for 6 years, learning two-weapon fighting and battlemaster techniques.

Now the hat controls his will and makes him commit evil acts that if I’m being honest, he’d probably be complicit in anyways."3/23/2018 9:44:50,Lied Tea'Sun,Human,Thrallherd,"Lied Tea'Sun was the third son born to a stonemason in the township of Delphi of Phil. He was apprenticed with a traveling wizard after Lied's mental abilities began to manifest. The wizard Beltran as a minor court wizard, and a troubleshooter of sorts for Duke Beltran.Lied spent several years employed as a gopher and lackey, while trying to learn the mystic arts. He learned a great deal about magical theory, the planes and the players in the various courts, but was unable to manage even the most basic cantrip. However, his psychic powers continued to develop, eventually enabling him to create his own gophers to deal with the basic chores left to him.A winsome lad, Lied was often time trotted out at gatherings, in part to entertain the other guests with his ""pets,"" and in part to help sway stubborn nobles to his master's view by offering counterpoint opinions with a child's voice. As he aged and grew into his position, Lied took on more diplomatic duties for his master. Lied also was sent to escort many young nobles of his age, while they traveled, in order to keep them safe.Eventually, Lied left Beltran's service after an unfortunate incident. Lied learned through mental whispers that Beltran intended to cheat a local lord out of his holdings, in order to find a place to settle down. Lied quietly informed the lord, but Beltran learned of Lied's interference. The parting was unfriendly; Beltran still holds a grudge against his former pupil.Lied traveled on his own for a few years before arriving at the rebuilt Shire of Hamp, which was in the midst of a spring solstice celebration. Later that night, Koa-Tao invaded, mere hours after the height of the celebration. Lied, along with several others in the village for the festival, managed to drive out the invaders, in large part because of Lied's ability to grant instant, quiet communication between the defenders. However, in the process of ousting, Lied learned that the Koa-Tao planned a much larger force to attack the nearby keep. The attack on the shire was meant to gain a staging area and resupply point. He also learned that another force was due to arrive soon.Lied convinced the local militia leader to send out a small force to warn the keep, while Lied prepared, along side those who were able, to defend the shire. Lied's strong words and personal magnetism inspired the defenders and, by the time the Koa-Tao arrived, they faced a group of grim, determined and nearly fanatical militia, along with potent astral beings. The siege of the Shire of Hamp took two days, with Duke Yueh's men arriving on the second night.The Koa-Tao were routed.Few of the village defenders survived, but those who did were hailed as heroes. At Duke Yueh's behest, Lied began an investigation into why the Koa-Tao attacked and how they managed to get so far inland without detection. On the way, Lied met up with a young priestess, Merrowynn, who was traveling from Livermore Falls to Derry. They agreed to travel together, at least as far as the city.It was in Derry the both learned how deep the corruption ran. Lied's investigation eventually uncovered a sizable group of clerics -- disaffected with the way the city refused to acknowledge their church as the true church, above all others -- had set up riots and other social unrest on the sly. Their intent was to show that having multiple faiths within a city, each equal, was disharmonious. Lied and Merrowynn uncovered and exposed the plot. They also learned that the funding the cabal used to bring in outside rabble rousers came from outside the city. Someone else wanted the city distracted while the Koa-Tao invaded. Merowynn, disgusted with how the clergy acted within the city, decided to travel with Lied to Gloucester, in part to get away from the very disappointing high priests, and in part to give Lied's warning weight when he arrived.Lied and Merrowynn's activities did not go unnoticed.Roland Cort was born into a minor noble family. The first son, Cort was raised with the expectation of ruling his lands, once his father passed away. However, Cort's father's passing came far earlier than thought. When Cort was 12, his manor was raided by Orcs, who slew his family, their servants and most of the local peasantry. Cort's father was not a benevolent ruler, and with the lands ruined by the raids, the remaining commonfolk left their villages for safer harbors. At the age of 12, Cort inherited his birthright: A burntout husk of a land, and none to work it. Bereft of kin or caretakers, Cort took to the streets. He spent several years earning his livelihood stealing what he could and always moving. His dreams were wracked by his memories of the slaughter. One night, after a particularly horrible nightmare, Cort awoke to a dread realization: He would forever be haunted by his past unless he took action.Not long later, Cort was caught stealing from a woodsman, Cypher. Cort plead, swearing his life and service to Cypher if he spared Cort's life. The woodsman, who was on a task set by his master, Walter, agreed to take Cort on; he was tired of carrying his own gear, and the thought of training someone so used to the city life amused him.Not long later, Cort began his tutelage into the arts of the woodlands, while stealing coin and other small trinkets from locked rooms to fund the pair's journey. Because Cypher did not have a sword small enough for Cort to train with, the woodsman gave him a long sword, far too large and heavy for Cort's slight build, and demanded Cort fight swiftly. Cort's training was strongly encouraged by Cypher's oak walking staff, which he used to beat the lad when Cort was slow.Within two month's time, the pair made their way to Keene, where the woodsman was to assassinate a local lord while the lord was on a hunt. Cort was given a bow, which he had proven to be naturally proficient with, and some distinctive silver-fletched arrows. The Cypher gave Cort a small bag of gold -- his share, he was told -- then left Cort at a tree copse and instructed the lad to wait. The gold made Cort suspicious, Cypher had never been generous before, which proved well founded. Cries of men quickly filled the forest, and not long later, men on horseback rode into sight. Cort hid, his eyes wide at the sight of one of the men, who was holding bloody, broken haft of an arrow, the fletchings identical to the ones he carried.Scared and furious, Cort managed to slip away from the men.Cypher didn't manage to slip away from Cort.Fifteen and angry, Cort decided the best way to get vengeance would be to strike out against the Orcs who first raided his home. Cort spent several months in the deep woods, carefully stalking and slaying any Orc or small Orc group that came across his path. He also made periodic forays back into human-controlled lands, buying whatever he needed, and killing whenever he needed something he couldn't buy.Cort's raw talent was noticed by an elder halfling named Arthur Bishop. Bishop introduced himself to Cort as a machinist, looking for someone to help him fix a problem: A young half-elf named Jill Ireland owes him money, and he wants it or proof she'll never pay. Cort takes the job, and does well. Soon, Bishop hired Cort on a more permanent basis, promising wealth and all the support Cort could want on his quest for revenge against the world, a world that Cort feels owes him. Bishop spent time training Cort in the arts of poison and stealth. He also attempted to dissuade Cort from favoring such oversized weapons, to little effect.After several years of service in the kingdom and abroad, Bishop asks Cort to deal with a simple matter: Two young adventurers are traveling near Derry, and should be delayed, but not slain. Bishop inform Cort that their current employer wants them holed up for at least a week, but not stopped entirely. Disgruntled, Cort makes his way to the outskirts of Derry and picks up the trail of two humans.Lied and Merowynn still remember their journey to Gloucester as among the worst treks of their lives. The horses they were riding constantly went lame, sometimes throwing them into burr patches or sharp ravines. Their food supply turned without them noticing; both took seriously ill from food poisoning. Not long after, a storm cut loose and a changed stream washed out the trail. After spending a full day getting the horses around the washout, one of the two geldings died, evidently from eating a particularly bad patch of nettles. A journey of five days stretched to 11. Sodden, hungry and fatigued, the pair arrived at Gloucester only to find the city in chaos and the gates closed: Someone had assassinated the city's lord as well as the heirophant of Baccob.Within a day, it is announced Koa-Toa glue was found near the assassination sites. A day later, Duke Yueh issues a call for the lords of the land to join together under his banner to take the war to the Koa-Toa.Lied and Merowynn manage to sneak into the city, and immediately begin their investigation. Through great effort, they are able to gain access to the sites where the lord and the heirophant were slain. They also track down an eyewitness, Serrano, who claims to have seen humans nearby when the assassinations occurred. The eyewitness says he could identify some of them, if he ever saw them again.Lied convinces Serrano to hide in a room in the dye district, then he and Merowynn quickly head to see Duke Yueh, who is preparing for war. Lied lays out all that he and Merowynn have learned so far: That someone funded dissidents in a nearby city to distract the local lord from the danger of the Koa-Toa army, and that someone seems ready to frame the recent death of a high clergyman and the Lord of Gloucester on the Koa-Toa. He also says they have found an eyewitness to one of the attacks, who says he can identify the culprits.The duke, in the midst of planning a campaign, did not appear convinced that the eyewitness was telling the complete truth. Lied tells him that Merowynn created a zone of truth to help confirm his story, and that many of the details in the witness's tale matched up with what transpired. Duke Yueh said that he'd need to investigate the man's story further; he told them he'd send other inquisitors to speak with him. Yueh then set the pair on a new task: They are to head to Manchester and speak with a man named Quisling. Quisling said he had information about a noble dealing with the Koa-Toa.After leaving the interview with Duke Yueh, Lied and Merowynn part company: Merowynn said that she had done all that she could, and that her church needed her to take up her assigned duties in Gloucester, especially after the assassination. Lied disagreed, but they parted on good terms.Merowynn returned to Gloucester, where Santibanez, the second in the city church, had ascended to power. After receiving her report on where she'd been and what she'd been up to, Santibanez assigned Merowynn to the comforting of the sick and dying, with strict instructions to stay out of the local political rings. Merowynn spent several ten-days tending to the ill, when she learned that the witness she and Lied hid away had been found dead, a bottle of cheap ale found in his hands.Merowynn, suspicious, begged Santibanez for permission to investigate. Santibanez told her that she'd spent far too much time on her own, and needed to learn discipline and order: The man's death was an accident, and any investigation was the purview of the local militia, not the church.The next night, Merowynn snuck into the church crypt and found Serrano's remains, a brown bottle placed on his chest. After careful consideration, she calls forth Serrano's spirit and asks him about his death. She learned that he did not die accidentally, but was instead poisoned. He never saw who killed him; Serrano found an ale bottle in his room, and thought it was a gift. He said the last thing he remembered while living was resting on his bed before sharp pains bit into his belly.After Serrono's ghost faded winked back into the afterlife, the world suddenly turned sideways as Merowynn staggered under an unfamiliar pressure. Her balance returning, Merowynn leaned up against one of the tomb walls and felt sickened as she realized her connection to the divine was muted and fading. Baccob, displeased with her disobedience to duty, stripped her of her divine connection.Weeping, Merowynn fled the tomb and into the night.Lied, riding his new horse, made his way over the space of a few weeks to Manchester, where he met up with Quisling. Quisling, a human with a happy temperament and a roguish grin, informed Lied about a local lord named Junta. Quisling told Lied that Lord Junta had a small cabal of wizards and monks serving him as a personal retinue, and that Junta had a hand in bribing station guards along the coast, as well as funding dissidents in Derry. Why, or incriminating documents, Quisling couldn't provide. He did however offer whatever aid he could in Lied's investigation.Lied spent several days wandering the city and asking questions, getting by on charm as best he could. He discovered that Lord Junta did indeed have a sizable retinue of powerful mages and monks at his service, and that many in the city felt that the king didn't support his faithful well: If they wanted things done, they'd have to do them.Lied mused for another day at the inn, then contacted Quisling and had him describe the seneschal of Lord Junta's house. Armed with the basics, Lied dominated the seneschal and arranged to be hired into the house as a servant. Once inside, Lied spent the better part of three weeks investigating and gathering evidence. It soon became clear to him that Lord Junta was extremely disturbed about being out of contact with one of his partners, though he never heard a name, and that whatever the lord was involved with, it was not going according to plan. Lied was able to gather several documents related to the plot, including a copy of the lord's ledger.Lied fled the lord's keep in the company of the seneschal, whom he then sent to local tavern with orders to get very drunk, then to brag about his lord's work. Lied left the city and began the long journey back to Duke Yueh, with proof of the mastermind behind the conspiracy.Lied rode a day away from the city, then teleported himself and his horse back to Derry. From there, he rode out to where Duke Yueh commanded the region's armies in a bid to strike back at the Koa-Toa. Lied laid out what he had discovered. Duke Yueh praised Lied, and set into motion plans to conquer Lebanon and put Lord Junta to trial, then death. Yueh ordered Lied to return to Derry and await word; he would require Lied's testimony at the high court. He also paid Lied well for his hard work. Lied returned to the city in the company of several warriors in Duke Yueh's service as a retinue.Some days later, a diminutive mage — seemingly half mad — forced her way past Lied's guard in an inn's commonroom, shouting about a poisoned gift that moved the body. Filthy, half-starved, the woman presented a human skull to Lied and begged him to listen to its words. It took Lied several moments to place this unkempt woman: Merowynn.After a lot of food and a bath, Merowynn was calm enough to tell Lied about what had happened to their witness, Serrano. She also told him that she'd later snuck back into the tombs and claimed his head after a particularly bad night of drinking. When Lied asked about her state, Merowynn told Lied that she had been cast out of the church for disobedience; since then she said she'd been too distraught to try and plan her future. After a very long discussion, including the promise of sobriety, Merowynn entered into Lied's service as a wizard.Deciding to make sure they had all the evidence they could for the high court of Lord Junta, Lied slipped into the tombs later that night in order to take the ale bottle buried with Serrano. While there, Lied was attacked by a young man carrying what appeared to be a troll's longsword. Summoning up an astral construct, Lied was able to fend his attacker off, but was badly hurt in the process. The running battle awoke the guardians of the churchyard. Foreseeing trouble, the man broke away from their fight. Seeing his own opportunity, Lied snatched the bottle from the tomb and teleported to an inn outside of town, then back to the townhouse where he and Merowynn were staying.That night, Lied got word from Duke Yeuh that it was time for him to assist in the capture of Lebanon and the subsequent high court: The war with the Koa-Toa was complete. Lied and Merowynn left Derry immediately, the bottle safely hidden away.The journey took several weeks to complete, as neither Lied nor Merrowynn had been to Lebanon before. The time on the road was not wasted, however. Merrowynn took samples from the bottle, in order to determine what kind of poison might have been used -- a long shot, at best. She also began performing scryings, using the bottle as the focus. Both resulted in limited success: There was enough residue left in the bottle to identify that poison was used, but not enough to clearly identify what it was, though it did seem to be potent, and rare. The scryings turned up little, save that the bottle was locally made, and had gone through several hands.Lied spent the journey partly riding in the carriage with Merrowynn, and partly back in Derry, teleporting between the locations during the evening stops. He spent the nights roaming the city and asking questions, often in disguise or, in certain instances, by using his charm. With the little information he was able to gather, he learned that the bottle had been placed in the room by a young human servant, who'd not been seen in the city since. A clear sign that a professional had been at work. He also learned that the wine was one of the more expensive, and usually only found among collectors or the wealthy, something their witness would not normally have access to.Slightly delayed, they arrived at Lebanon on the eve of the final assault. Lied and Merrowynn fought bravely, and played a good part in the city's taking. Lied also became fascinated by the use of ground troop maneuvers, which eventually spurred a life-long study of group tactics.The city taken, the guilty found, the land began to rejoice. Lied and Merrowynn were invited to sup with Duke Yueh and King Haart, who had arrived too late with his own men to help deal with the matter. After the dinner, the king was to hear the guilty's pleas, then render judgement.The duke spoke with the king at length that evening, accepting the king's praise. Duke Yueh began making inroads towards claiming the lands he'd saved, as it was clear those who ran it were unable to govern with any skill. The king seemed inclined, but noncommittal. After the feast, a dessert wine was served for the enjoyment of the royal table.The wine the Duke served came from a distinctive brown bottle, with Derry's mark.Lied 'arranged' for the bottle to be spilled, and then made sure to spirit it away after the next wine was brought. He passed the bottle to Merrowynn, and asked her to mystically examine the bottle for poisons. She didn't find any. What she did find was that this bottle and the bottle from the gravesite both shared owners.Lied pigeonholed Lord Malachai, the right-hand man of King Haart, and begged him to delay the hearings of the local lords by a day. Lied did not go into specifics, saying merely that he had stumbled across evidence of other crimes that might prove unconvictable, should the trials precede. Malachai recognized Lied's assistance in the battle, but was not greatly impressed with what little he brought forward. Still, he was willing to talk with the king, and suggest a noon-time hearing, rather than a late evening one, so that more of the local populous could attend. Lied, grateful for what time he got, moved quickly forward, doing his best to shake loose the wine of the evening.Lied presents his evidence, impressing the king, but the exchange is overheard. Lied and Merowyn fend off an assassin sent to slay them in revenge, Cort, eventually turning him to their side. After many further adventures, Lied gains the position of Minister of Law for the kingdom."3/23/2018 9:46:52,Fosco Bushdimple,Halfling,Monk,"He was a member of a dangerous street gang, the Silver Serpents, and an underground cage fighter known as the Hook for his deadly chain and sickle combo.

Just past 18, she's left her mother's hut and the care of her father, a farmer, to experience the world. (But: See goals.)2) She has helped fund the livelihood of what remains of her family through her witchcraft skills. She left nearly all of her years of savings behind to help her father, whom she treasures.3) Despite her youth and exuberance, she's remarkably skilled in getting along with others, as well as settling down disputes. She favors calm debate, and, if that fails, a frying pan to the back of a head.4) Not being a fool, she will present herself and her craft as a sort of 'hedge wizardry,' or herbalist  to strangers. Despite this, she is deeply proud of her studies, and has spent many, many hours listening to the secrets held within the songs of her familiar, a thrush.5) Her mother, Morgaise, and her mother's mother, were also witches. Her mother left the family when Selene was 8 in pursuit of her own goals. Her departure was not amicable among the family. The departure was glossed over to the best of Selene's father's ability among the communities they visited.Reasons for adventuring:1) The character is hunting down her mother, who left to join a coven of hags. Selene has heard vague, contradictory rumors of the types of damage this coven is doing. She sees it as her personal goal to end the group, and to either convince her mother to return, or take vengeance for those she's wronged. Selene is a bit fuzzy on what will actually happen when she finds her mother (as, again, she's inexperienced.) Unfortunately, Selene has no real idea where this coven is operating out of.2) The player would like a chance to watch the character develop. I'm not particularly interested in taking her into a dark and gritty place, at least not permanently. But it would be good to see an optimistic outsider try to establish her place in the world.Place in the world:1) Selene Paige keeps her witchhood secret, presenting herself as a hedge wizard or wise woman to anyone who asks. She's heard enough stories of scared villagers taking out frustrations on practitioners of the craft without really understanding what they are facing. [character known secret] 2) Selene's mother joined the coven under some duress, but she was never a particularly nice person: That was Selene's father, Rachel. How much Selene's mother regrets her decision is an open question. [character unknown secret] 3) [See people known, below] Selene is unaware that Lothos Marksbane argued passionately with Marcus Windfinder against racing ahead of the goblin raiding party, fearing the trio would be slain. During the congratulatory celebration later, Lothos swore a half-drunk Marcus to secrecy, something Marcus now deeply regrets. [character unknown secret]Friends and foes:1) Inquisitor Rodrick DelDemin has long trailed behind Selene. He suspects her of selling charms and curses linked to a slew of ill animals, stillbirths and failed crops, in part because of who her mother is. DelDemin is also a former adventurer partner of Selene's father, Rachel. As such, he won't commit to killing or capturing Selene until he's sure of her guilt. While DelDemin will not admit it, he wants Selene to be guilty.2) Lothos Marksbane is an archer of great skill, and a childhood friend. The pair, along with Marcus Windfinder, spent years traipsing the woodlands and territories surrounding her summer hut and getting into trouble with the local village elders. The trio discovered and warned a village of a raiding party of goblins, which earned each of them some renown.3) Marcus Windfinder is the second-best archer in the village, behind only Lothos. He spends his days bringing in game for the town, and his nights watching Lothos draw in eyes and ale in equal measure at the local tavern. The villagers who notice think Marcus, a plain-looking man, is jealous of Lothos's skill. Marcus, however, finds quiet doubt as to how honest his childhood friend really is.Personality quirks:Selene smoothes her shawl when nervous and widens her eyes when angry. She gets into music-mimic contests with her thrush when bored (which she loses. Badly.)She regularly carries a small frying pan, bound to a detachable rope tied to her belt. She refers to it as her 'iron logic.' While Selene is perfectly capable of being focused and on-task, if things are not actively urgent, her primary focus is exploration and discovery.Selene would most likely walk into the area of gameplay while searching for signs of her mother. She's not the kind of person who ignores others' troubles, so as long as there was some group actively seeking to solve whatever was taking place, she'd join in. Her reasonings: In part to help out, in part to earn her daily bread, but mostly for the excuse to discover more of the world around her."3/23/2018 9:50:01,Hrrikke,Aarakocra,Monk/Cleric,"For the brothers of the Monastery of the Yellow Rose, to ride the remorhaz is the ultimate test - a trial of agility, cunning, and the raw endurance necessary to withstand the beast's burning skin. As such, when a nest of Aarakocra fell betwixt the planes and surfaced on the White Worm's own head - and when, against all odds, one of these unlucky orphans actually survived the ordeal - the brothers took the child in without question. Only the Crying God could have brought such fate to pass.Hrrikke grew up slightly detached from the other monks, not least due to the suddenness with which his inhuman body matured. He grew and ascended the ranks rapidly as a scholar, but was prevented from mastery by an incomplete grasp of his own abilities. The Aarakocran body is simply not the same as a human's. He may have wasted away his potential, never passing the rank of Immaculate, had an expedition of penance not gone awry, leaving him stranded and alone for forty days and forty nights.By the time he returned, he had not only perfected his previously shaky martial arts, but also awakened to a primordial form of magic of his very own. The monks quickly agreed: this was beyond their grasp, as a group made - for the most part - by humans and for humans. The young Aarakocra learned best on his feet, without species-exclusive teachings to slow his progress down. They would have to entrust him to the care of the greater Church of Ilmater, and hope that the Crying God would reward young Hrrikke's continued sufferance in the outside world.Two years have passed since, and Hrrikke - now middle-aged by Aarakocran standard - has received some clerical training, and is considered a model servant of Ilmater. So much so, in fact, that he has been selected as part of an exclusive exchange program amongst the followers of the Triad. Now, he ventures forth alongside the clergy of Tyr and Torm, to introduce the light of Ilmater to the legendary Order of the Gauntlet."3/23/2018 9:51:07,Bairen Kamelot,Human (Variant),Fighter/Bard,"His father a distinguished captain, and his mother a Lady of some repute, it was only fitting that Bairen himself ended up quite the dull young man. His youth was spent frittering away his allowance on bottle after bottle of ink for what he called ‘poems’, which mostly ranged from mediocre to dreadful. It was only after his mother stopped giving him gold in favor of glares that Bairen began to take life into his own hands, earning what spending money he could through practiced performance. He would have liked to believe that the poetry was what drew his crowds. Alas, more likely it was the brawl that would doubtless erupt once some poor local had had enough of his babbling. The boy couldn’t write to save his life, but he was a fine grappler.Perhaps he had some inkling of this, which led to his depression as he grew. Try as they might, his parents never quite managed to groom him into the noble sort; though his diction grew more genteel as time passed, his disposition remained as appealing as ever. That is to say, not quite. By his 30th birthday, his mother had finally given up on bequeathing the Kamelot inheritance upon her little Bairen. By his 35th, his father had given up patience. And so it was that Bairen came to find himself on the battlefield, packed off to a small mercenary band in the middle of nowhere, fighting a small local war he cared even less for than the rest of the world. The letter in his breast pocket told him not to come home until he’d learned to be proud, which confused him. He was incredible as people came, and none knew this better than Bairen Kamelot. His strength was ludicrous; his idiocy, much the same. But his comrades appreciated him, and in time, he came to reciprocate. He had never been trusted before, even to be a failure, but here he found allies who had no other choice. It was, in his life, the highest goods of his living times; so those last few missives said.Nobody knows what happened to the mercenaries Bairen first learned to trade drinks with. Nobody knows where his young daughter - Haato, she calls herself - came from. Certainly nobody knows how she got to the Kamelot estate, a year and a day from her father’s departure; or how she found her way inside, past the gate and the walls, to curl up at the foot of her grandmother’s bed; or how she did all that with a scroll in one tiny hand and a letter in the other.But the biggest mystery of all, they say, is about Bairen Kamelot himself. If he was with those mercenaries; if this is his daughter, as she claims; and if this letter truly is in Bairen’s own hand:Then when, where, how… Who or what could have taught him?For Bairen Kamelot has learned to write."3/23/2018 9:52:02,Unit SH3,Warforged,Sorcerer/Bard,"A homunculus created as a servant to an aging wizard, much of Unit SH3's early life was spent tending to the wizard's prized sheep, until the day the adventurers came.After that day, Unit SH3 continued to tend to the  prized sheep for about a week before returning to the keep to find it leveled.

In a work environment, he favors button down shirts and ties with semi-hidden star wars symbols on them. While trying to be comfortable, he tends to wear dark, loose-fitting clothing, usually while carrying a bag of carrot sticks or celery. On odd weekends, Kay is dragged out of his home by his older brother, Jay, to take part in mountain biking or paint ball events. While Kay vigorously protests going on these excursions, he finds they help him burn off a lot of his nervous energy, and keep him connected with his brother.Current Appearance: A member of the Yokai race, Kay has white hair and teal eyes, both of which he tries to conceal when visiting 'civilized' areas. He wears rough work gloves, a beginner set of greaves and breast plate, as well as an average cloak and a red knit cap. He uses the latter to hide his hair. He carries a simple scythe on his back, along with a longbow, both of which jut out above his 4'10""-tall frame.Pre-transformation Info:Kay is a 31-year-old corporate accountant, formerly of Wisconsin, most recently of Boise, Idaho. He spends most of his days tracking down tax-code errors and improving database cohesion. Needless to say, when the opportunity arrived to try a realistic-feeling game different life, he jumped at it.Kay has spent a number of years playing a variety of online games, including ""World of Warppath"" and ""Ever Online."" He has very limited experience, though, with the precursor full sensory dive systems that have become popular in recent years.Kay is a little surprised that his name got pulled as a winner, as he does not remember entering the contest. He suspects his brother, Jay, had something to do with it. That said, once he was notified he'd reached the semi finals a few months ago, he embraced the idea of exploring a VR world. He did, however, fill out a living will before arriving at the test center. He does not believe the kinds of trouble that happened two years ago will strike again, but it's always important to be prepared.Kay is definitely looking forward to spending a few hours of fun in the life of a barbarian, one who never has to worry about preparation or checking every detail twice, just to be sure. (The chance to vent a little of his nerd rage on a few helpless kobolds also sounds wonderful.)Background:Kay has an older brother, Jay, as well as an on-again, off-again girlfriend named Mary Sue Regionald. Mary, for reasons she refuses to explain, hates Star Trek, something Kay loves to tease her about. Kay's mother and father live in Florida, where they operate a bed and breakfast just outside Fort Walton Beach.Kay is happy with his life as an accountant, but feels like something is lacking.

People are liable to attack you, either physically, through their words, or with small acts of passive aggression like raising prices or casting suspicious glances. By the time she was 10 years old, Dehlirhia had been arrested twice for something she hadn’t done, and while the true culprits were eventually found in both cases, she had been incredibly lucky that they were.    Her family - a single father and two brothers - were generally supportive of her, and they all generally helped each other survive off of whatever pay they could manage. When her eldest brother, Gaelen, was lynched for some crime he supposedly committed, the Axiom family silently agreed to spread out to have a better chance of surviving.    The somewhat well-respected Axeies, her father, stayed in the city and continued his job as an archivist of old tales and spells, while her younger brother Venaith moved to a smaller town, planning to make a living by selling magical ingredients. As for Dehlirhia, she decided that people were simply not for her, and moved to a secluded place out in the woods. She made a simple living there, hunting animals and occasionally selling the hide for a small amount of gold, which she would then use for small luxuries like soap and a heavier blanket. Usually, things were peaceful.    However, trouble did its best to find her, and during a particularly vicious attack Dehlirhia lost her old weapon - a simple axe - and gained several scars. She had intended to save what looked to be a stray cat from a pack of monsters, but instead ended up in the middle of a battle. Fighting one-handed with a cat in her other arm was not easy for her, and she had just about given up, assuming that the silvery mist beginning to cloud her vision was her life force fading.    And then she teleported up into a nearby tree along with the very confused cat.    As it turned out, the mist had in fact been a teleportation spell, not her last breaths, and the cat was in fact a rather awkward wood-elf druid. The two became friends simply due to having been in a life-threatening situation together, and when the druid eventually announced his intentions to leave the forest, Dehlirhia insisted on following him so that he “wouldn’t get himself killed”."3/23/2018 9:57:13,Ouranos Nantarath,Triton,Paladin,"After drifting into a deep current during a tense battle against the sahuagin, Ouranos was nursed back to health by a family of merfolk en route to Myth Nantar.

Malcom favors simple tunics and rough pants; things he doesn't mind getting damaged as he wanders the woods. He does keep a, slightly stained, scholar's outfit in his backpack, for festival days or the rare visits to town.Background: Malcom grew up as a huntsman and occasional poacher in the woodlands near Duke Merci's summer manor. Malcom lost his father to a boar attack two seasons ago, when his arrow missed its mark, something he's still sore about. His mother weaves and raises bees, then sells what surplus she has at the local markets. Malcom has an older brother, Tomas, who handles the farmwork and has already inherited the land. His second-oldest brother, Ferrus, tends to the cow and several sheep to the best of his ability, which ranges from quite good to comically bad, depending on whether or not his leg is acting up.Malcom, following in his father's footsteps, hunted to bring in extra food for the family, as well as trade goods or tallow for candles. Since his father's death, however, Malcom sees that his family's needs are stronger than what the land can provide: It is obvious that they are one or two bad winters away from starvation and death. As such, he has set out to make his fortune, seeking better hunting in lands away from Duke Merci's control, or perhaps even treasure snatched from one of those rumored ruins he hears in the tales of bards. As well as he knows the uncharted lands, surely he can find his way to someplace long forgotten, and then safely home again.Personality: Dedicated. Untraveled. Has a deep respect for the learned, and wishes he was one.Animal Companion: ""Meerkat,"" a Sunda Clouded Leopard (Big Cat animal companion). She is a sucker for dried Gecko strips, old boots to gnaw on, and lap time at inopportune moments. Malcom once trained Meerkat to pounce, sans claws, on any blanket rolls with red trim, as part of a prank on his middle brother. The trick stuck, but expanded to pouncing on Malcom when he's in deep sleep. Malcom now keeps a spare blanket specifically with red trim, to keep Meerkat occupied and happy at night.Additional notes:Boar spears were created specifically because boars are ridiculously dangerous; European nobility who hunted them were either bored (or boar-ed!), wanted a chance to prove personal bravery, or weren't too concerned about the staff (or some combination there-in). I was aiming to create the image of the classic rogue woodsman, rather than the more realistic hunter, the latter who'd be working with beaters, or who'd be on the watch for smaller game and quite possibly using traps.Malcom left to seek his fortune, specifically to help the family. I imagine that his relationship with his mother is good, and a little strained with the inheriting brother, in part because he is the inheritor, and in part because the inheritor isn't doing enough to see to the family's long-term future.I'd left both Duke Merci and the events surrounding his poaching past open, in part because I didn't want to overload the application, and in part because I was thinking to let that part of the story unlock as the game progressed. In my head, Duke Merci would be viewed as evil by Malcom -- he has land and refuses to let the commoners hunt on it. From Merci's viewpoint, he's performing medieval conservation efforts: He wants better hunts for himself, and knows there won't be enough game for him, or permitted hunters, if he allows his people to over-hunt the lands. I don't believe Malcom was ever caught, simply because he'd likely have lost a limb for the crime. There’d likely to be suspicion, though, especially on the local level.For a modern equivalent, I'd equate the poaching to moonshining: His family are the people you see if you want fresh meat, and the local law is overlooking it, either because the guards are also being supplied, are taking bribes, or have other things to worry about.(As a side thought: Depending on how prevalent monster attacks are in this world, armsmen/guards may not give a lot of thought to hunters heading out into the woods. If stepping in the wrong glen means vanishing for 30 years via a fairy ring or encountering a gnoll, poaching may be viewed as a 'self-correcting problem.')That said, if there's an interesting story to be had, I'm perfectly fine with the idea that one of Malcom's motivations was to get out of the region for a while to let the heat die down a bit after a deer hunt went bad. I'd prefer not to do a wanted man scenario with him, if for no other reason than it would be a detriment to other players' experience to have a hunted person stuck with them. But, I could easily see him wanting to avoid home until he has enough gold and influence to make any simmering problems go away.As far as childhood friends or Ferrus's leg injury, I was leaving those details open for discovery during game play. I know that Malcom can't be [I]too[/I] close with anyone, or he would have planned for a shorter journey, or talked a friend into coming. I also don't see him as having a girl who got away, mostly as I'm not interested as a player in pursuing that particular story arc. But these caveats wouldn't mean that he was an unlikable person, nor that he was antisocial growing up. The easiest solution is that he's independent minded, and likely wishes to solve his family's problems without dragging others into the mess (especially if, as was common for the era, his social peers are also subsistence living. With that being the case, a young body simply can't be spared from work to go out adventuring, unless the family in question simply can't support feeding everyone.)Personality for him is nebulous; I never really know who a character is until I sit down and run him for a bit. I know that he's been raised to view the law as a good suggestion, at best. I know that he'd have to be comfortable working on his own, as hunting can be an individual, or small group activity. I know that despite his time and resource constraints, he still made time to train up his animal friend to pull a long-term joke on his brother (which only mostly worked out for him.) I know he views family as very important, which would inform a good relation with most of them, as well as a need to protect, both of which would lean to a “Good” alignment type.So, he'd be a slightly lawless, self-sufficient type, one who'd likely think less of someone who couldn't handle themselves in the woods, as that's what he knows best. He's not humorless, and he will work hard for long-term goals. And he has a craving for knowledge: He carries a scholar's outfit, in part because he wants to dress as his ideal person, a person with wisdom or breadth of experience. His upbringing wouldn't have allowed him too much exposure to book learning, but he'd know enough to believe that all of the world's mysteries might be answered by finding the right sage or reading the right tome.If we're talking cooler climates, I'm happy to swap out gecko meat for something more accessible, such as owl or guinea. I was just fleshing out some details on the cat's personality."3/23/2018 9:58:31,Dr. Duke Balfour,Human,Sage (Adjunct professor of humanities at Maine Maritime Academy),"Appearance: Duke is a wiry fellow with dark hair and a thin goatee. He generally carries himself loosely, walking with confidence. He favors a brown corduroy jacket, which is worn over button-down shirts.Archetype: Sage (Doctorate in Literature [old English])Job/Profession: Dr. Duke Balfour teaches humanities to undergraduates at the Maine Maritime Academy. Balfour has been working as an adjunct professor there for the last two years while he finished his doctoral thesis, Body, Text and Self in Old English Verse: A Study of “Beowulfian” and “Cynewulfian” Rhetoric. On the weekends, he helps shepherd the academy's Small Watercraft Club's activities, to mixed results.Nationality/Languages: Duke has a U.S. nationality. He speaks, or at least reads, English, Old English, Middle English, Latin, Portuguese and French. He has an abiding love for French poetry, and is constantly collecting older, or rarer, works for his library. He very nearly wrote a thesis on Marceline Desbordes-Valmore's work. While the call of dusty libraries eventually won out, he has since published a number of academic analyses on her poetry.Back story: Born in Kansas, Duke Balfour was born the first child of three to Emily and Lucas Balfour, and grew up on in a small suburb outside Topeka, Kansas. Lucas taught mathematics at Topkea West High for decades. Emily took a medical retirement from the Coast Guard when Duke was six, after an accident at sea cost her the lower part of her right arm, directly below the elbow. Evenings at home consisted of hearing wild sea stories while diligently working simple mathematics problems. Weekends were spent on Kansas River, learning to read the water and general boat safety. As he got older, Duke began taking the boat out with fellow high school friends, which lead to a number of scraps between his fellows and some of the rougher sorts around the docks. While none of it was serious, it did spark an interest in self defense. Duke spent his sophomore and junior years learning to box at a local YMCA, before dropping the sport in his senior year to the combination of waning interest and limited time for extra hobbies. While Duke never mastered the higher-order mathematics to his father's satisfaction, his mother's wild sea stories, and both of their encouragement, eventually led him towards a career in academia, with a focus on the softer arts. Duke's siblings include a sister, Olivia, and Peter, the youngest of the family. Olivia has a degree in law enforcement, and recently started working in a Montana police department. Peter has just graduated from high school, and is at loose ends. Duke has dated off and on, most recently with a professor in the physics department, but has not yet made a solid connection. He does speak at least once a week with family, and emails more often. Peter visits Duke at the academy for a weekend every now and again.Temperament/Behavior: A confident dreamer. The combination of boxing during his youth, as well as overcoming rough waters and rougher weather, have left him with a general confidence in his ability to handle challenges. He knows he's not the toughest guy out there by any stretch, but he has already faced danger, and knows where his limits are. He has a general dislike of computers for anything more complicated than word processing or sending an email. He usually carries a book of some sort with him, wherever he goes, in case he gets bored. He walks whenever possible. Duke has heard every single John Wayne reference imaginable, and hates all of them. He's not big into movies: He prefers being active, or spending time among the comforts of the archives and rare book collections.Supernatural experience: Walking back late at night from a weekend sailing event, Duke noticed an unusual glow coming from the waters near a crag. Curious, he half-climbed, half-skid his way down to the edge of the Atlantic, where he found nine glowing lights just under the surface of the water. The yellow lights faded, leaving three blue-green lights, which almost immediately shifted to seven red dots. The ocean air blew in strong at that moment, which forced Duke back on his heels. As he regained his balance, he saw five purple lights wink out of existence. Getting cold, he made his way home. The following day, he revisited the site, to see if he could see anything. When he arrived at the bottom of the crag, he found a strange plant growing out of the water, with knots grown in odd patterns throughout the stem. When he reached in to touch it, for a moment he lost his hearing altogether, and a shine of iridescent light flowed through the veins of the weed, before settling into the knots. The plant now sits, alive, in an aquarium in Duke's office, while he tries to discover what type of plant it is, and why he saw what he did."3/23/2018 9:59:13,Calusar Voninvenn,Water Genasi,Warlock,"A failed squire who, frustrated at the loss of his hundredth duel, blamed the blacksmith for creating a faulty sword and blasphemed against the honor of the forge. For his insolence, Calusar was struck down by an apparent agent of the blacksmith’s god; he unexpectedly survived, but was cursed to serve the surprised blacksmith until further notice.Despite his initial resistance, Calusar came to understand the blacksmith’s dedication, and even began to enjoy working at her side, and seeing the efforts that went into masterpieces he could never dream of creating. As such, when another unsatisfied customer came by – a knight who had twisted his wrist on the battlefield – the young squire lost his temper and challenged the knight to a duel. His patron, pleased with this development, granted him the ability to pour the strength of his own emotions into his weapon; and though it broke in the end – he was not yet a true smith himself – he won the duel handily.With that, the blacksmith’s honor was restored, but Calusar, having challenged and defeated a knight, drew the ire of the local nobility. In order to avoid damaging the smithy’s business, he bargained with his patron to change the nature of his sentence, and left town bound to carry out his patron’s whims."3/23/2018 10:01:10,Mika,Half elf,Favored soul,"Mika was an anomaly in their small farming village when they were born - a half elf with innate magic in a village of humans. Quickly decried as the bastard child of an unfaithful mother, Mika’s mother gave them to the leader of the village, an exiled noble who saw the potential to further their own schemes in Mika’s innate powers. The noble raised the child to believe in a made-up harvest deity named Pieri, and to also view themselves as nothing more than an extension of this deity. Over time, they were taught to call themselves Pieri as well, and to view all other deities as inferior and dangerous due to events in the story of deity-Pieri. They grew up into a religious zealot whose idea of evangelism was “convert or die - for your own good” - just as the noble had planned. The noble then set Pieri out on the countryside. Their plan was to let Pieri wreck havoc on the countryside, only for the village to step in and provide aid (and surreptitiously take over in the process). If people actually converted, then that was another way to take power. If anyone in power took notice, the village would then step in and take Pieri down, knowing their weaknesses and all. Then they would get quite the boon for taking down such a dangerous fanatic - and the noble would have a base of power to work off of.The plan worked, except for one small detail - the noble vastly underestimated Pieri’s power. Eventually, someone did call for the destruction of Pieri, but when the village sent soldiers out, they were decimated. Enraged by their home sending forces against them, Pieri made their way back and burned the village. After that, they mostly disappeared, occasionally resurfacing to enact their particular brand of evangelism. Now flying under the radar, Pieri gained even more power - until the world began unraveling around them. Due to wider world events Pieri had been unconcerned with, the entire plane was falling apart. They sought shelter in a remote desert town under the protection of a demigod druid; the town would soon become the only remaining place on the Material Plane, held together by the druid’s willpower alone.Parties of the plane’s most powerful heroes were sent out as the plane unraveled - but all of them were doomed, never to return. Finally, there were only six “heroes” left - including Pieri. And so they set out with the others, the Material Plane’s last hope for survival."3/23/2018 10:02:28,Hilda,Half orc,Cleric,"Her parents were sailors but she got seasick easily, so had to stay on land. She stayed with her grandparents, but was much taller than them and kept bumping into things as she got older. One day she stumbled into an inn in need of a barmaid/cook. She loved cooking above all else, so applied and got the position, that alsp came with a room off of the kitchen. She then fell in love with the innkeeper's son, and they eventually got married and ran the business. They had a few kids and everything was dandy until a disaster struck the town. Hordes of undead were shambling toward the town. She happened o be shopping at the time in the market, so she immediately started herding people into the local church. Almost everyone was inside except one small child. She threw herself on top of the child and prayed, then got a divine blessing of clericdom. After the event, her children were all adults and helping her husband run the inn, and she felt called to travel and help others as her parents had done. She makes sure to write and travel back whenever possible, but she is now a healer and protector of the nearby towns."3/23/2018 10:05:43,Rochia,Feral Hellfire Tiefling,Rogue,"The fact of the matter is, some kids don't get to go to Wizard School.Rochia was born in a slum outside of a large city, and promptly abandoned in a dumpster. Too homely to be adopted by some benevolent noble and too alien to be picked up by the average orphan gang, he was instead picked up as an experimental subject for the local hospital. They called him ""roach"" for his seemingly miraculous survival, no matter what they did. He was understood to be useful for testing new surgical techniques or medicines for several years, until small tremors and strange sounds began to manifest in his immediate vicinity. He was dropped back out onto the streets with the vague understanding that magic had helped him somehow; and so he came to take an interest in the magic users of the city.Wizard school is expensive, class-restrictive, and a full-time job; completely outside of Rochia's reach. He instead took up odd jobs at anywhere he could have chances to be close to the city-dwellers, and took his time becoming a familiar, uninteresting sight. Bathing was right out; the dust hid his reddish scales well. Never raise your head, never meet any eyes, never surpass mediocrity in any way: this was his mantra. In this way, he managed to steal arcane secrets for almost a decade before being caught, taking time to add each eked-out spell to his mental toolbox.Rochia meets the party soon after fleeing for his life from the only place he's ever known. He carries with him the fruits of years of contingency plans, set into motion over the course of a week: a full set of stolen adventuring equipment, and more gold than he knows what to do with. Driven by desperation, he offers any service he can to the mighty-looking group, if only they'll take this miserable little urchin along with them."3/23/2018 10:07:15,Arrhenia Citrinitas,Tiefling,Sorcerer,"Charmed her way into the Guild of Alchemists & Apothecaries at a young age and worked her way up.Very good at her job, and a popular conversationalist at guild parties, but for reasons which totally have nothing at all to do with racism, she doesn’t work at the front desk. Fascinated with the inherent dissatisfaction of the sapient condition, she studies how chemistry may improve it for individuals. An ancestor of hers, tired of being a tiefling, permanently infused the family bloodline with dragon essence by unknown means -- and yes she's certain it wasn't by mating -- so solving that mystery may go some way toward her goal."3/23/2018 10:07:33,Llewellyn Oth Sewan,Human,Wizard,"Llewellyn was born in the sprawling ramshackle slums outside the walls of Macropolis. Unlike most of his peers and his parents, Llewellyn is literate, havingreceived a better than average education from the free school run by the monks of the Hand In the Flame cult. When he was twelve, he was apprenticed to his uncle's glovemaking shop, and fully expected to follow both his uncle and father into the garment business. However, in his late teens, he had a life-changing encounter with an itinerant festival mage, who convinced Llewellyn to leave off glovemaking. What followed was nearly 40 years of tedious and oft-regretted servitude as a student-scholar and steward to the Mage's Council, located in the Office of the Seven Towers. Now, after his retirement from the civil service, Llewellyn has struck out on his own as a sellspell, always hungry for the one big job that will allow him to buy his way into the landed gentry."3/23/2018 10:07:40,Styl Neinarte,Eladrin,Fighter/Wizard,"She seemed the ideal warrior. Her agility was remarkable; here was one who truly felt how to dance with the blade, coursing like water around her opponents' attacks. Belying that seeming lightness, her magic was incredible; with a flick of her hand, she could clear vast swathes of a battlefield at once, a force of nature unto herself. And even when that arcane might ran out, she would never falter, pushing her way through her foes like a wildfire on its inexorable path of destruction.If only she wasn't so damned mysterious.Styl Neinarte was the perfect Eladrin warrior in every aspect but one, in that she didn't seem like a very good Eladrin. She never wept at the beauty of the stars; she never lost her temper in a brawl for dominance; she never even threw her hat in the air in celebration at the conclusion of the day's training. It was unnatural, was what it was. Like some kind of stone-faced shadow from beyond the moon, Styl was always simply... there. And then there's the matter of those eerie new spells she was experimenting with. What were her classmates supposed to think? Steinheart, they called her. If we're all being honest here, I have to agree. That girl just isn't right.It couldn't be helped. There was simply no way we could send her out into our society like that - not if she never learned to let loose, like a real fey fighter, show everyone the color of her blood and laugh it off for once - you understand, don't you? That is not how things are done. Not at this institution. So, well, we had to make her... disappear.Oh, don't look at me like that. No, no, she can come right back, after she's grown up a bit. You know how it is, with these younglings. A few beatings out there, a human or two she can raise and care for until it dies - do her a world of good.Give it a century or two, she'll come right around. You watch.Nothing like the proper fey way to solve a problem child."3/23/2018 10:07:48,Kannadi Albedo,Human,Warlock,"A mid-autistic daughter of a new-money noble family, born with access to the best private tutors. Kannadi acquitted herself well in academics and magic, but her talents were spent running much of her family's accounting.One day she inspected her family's newest holding, a salt flat relatively unexploited due to it being a nesting ground for monsters. The mercenaries she employed to clear it out were killed to a man, not by local fauna but the archfey Nacil, the self-proclaimed Crystal Dame, Dehydrated Duchess, Lady of Salt, et cetera. Nacil would have killed Kannadi too, but found her mind so fascinating she offered a pact so that she might realize her true potential. Kannadi agreed on condition that her family alone could (carefully) harvest the flat."3/23/2018 10:08:43,Pennie “Pen” Pepperring,Halfling,Wizard,"Pen is a merchant with dreams of power and wealth and a willingness to do just about anything to get it. Their mercantilism started in basic trade goods - primarily food and raw materials - but he quickly expanded into black market goods, most frequently magical items and artifacts of questionable origin. With the death of his grandfather, he inherited a set of magical stones, unlike anything else known to the Three Nations, that his grandfather had supposedly found on an uncharted island after a shipwreck. Determined to find the source of the stones and secure a monopoly, Pen signed up to become part of a ship’s crew."3/23/2018 10:08:59,"Syprinn ""Meteor"" Rubrofuscus",Dragonborn,Cleric,"Syprinn Rubrofuscus, cheerful enough to go by her juvenile name ""Meteor"" if you're her friend, loved history and hated how much of it lay forgotten.Her greatest desire was to uncover hitherto-forgotten secrets, to remember for those who can't and preserve for those who can, but archaeology doesn't come cheap. She attached herself to whatever expeditions she could in the hopes of building up more connections and gathering funding. One day her expedition discovered a forgotten temple. She stood in the wrong place and touched the wrong thing, and found herself chosen by the temple's god to defend others in their name.The decision wasn't hers, but knowing the need that she could fill, she accepted it regardless. Now she balances service with education and exploration, not exactly enthusiastically when it comes to holiness. She has something of an eye-rolling relationship with her patron, humoring them for the power to better learn and serve and protect rather than worshiping them on their own merits."3/23/2018 10:10:47,Canary Temp,Ghostwise Halfling,Ranger/Cleric/Druid/Rogue/Sorcerer,"So, he hails from a small tribe of Ghostwise halflings who lived under a mountain pass, on the border of the Underdark, known as the Crystalline Clergy. They believe that their ghostly blue eyes and their limited telepathic capabilities (Silent Speech) are gifts from sharing the heritage of a Sapphire Dragon who once ruled this area of the Underdark; and in thanks for this, they worship the god of the gem dragons, Sardior of knowledgeA group of adventurers from the Surface (I've taken to the name ""The Primordial Heart"", but whatever works) went on a mission to assassinate the Elder Brain of the nearest illithid colony, and didn't do so hot. They fled, and stumbled upon the Crystalline Clergy, hiding and resting outside of the village to discuss their options; the mind flayers caught up to them, which they figured out when they started seeing halflings dropping from psychic blasts. In the ensuing battle, they rebuffed the mindflayer attack, but most of the village was destroyed. They picked up the first halfling they'd seen fall, and ran, fearing a cave-inBetween guerilla attacks from various other Underdark beasts and simple lack of supplies, they weren't in any shape to take care of their halfling ward, so when they got to the Surface, they made a deal with a local Druid to heal him and their party rogue, who seemed to have gone down on the way out; then, they left to wherever they came from, whoever had sent them on that quest, to lick their wounds and have their own continuing adventuresThe halfling was nursed back to health, but the extended period of time without treatment made some of the damage too severe; he couldn't remember his name or identity, and he could no longer comprehend Common, which put him in a dark place for a bit. The Druid eventually turned him around to a greater appreciation of nature, with a major breakthrough being when the Druid realized that always taking him out into the sun didn't make him listen - it was night, another of Sardior's domains, that made the halfling appreciate the beauty of the worldThe halfling took a new name from the phrase the adventurers had left - they wanted the druid to heal their 'canary in the mines', so he became ""Canary (Temporary)"". He became accustomed to the Surface, interacting with Surface animals, and began returning to books again to get a better hold of more languages.The sad thing about the Underdark is that it has a lot of horrible things, like Intellect Devourers, which eat your brains and possess your body. This is what had happened to the Primordial Heart's rogue, who had also been left with the Druid for healing; which is why Canary had to fight off a powerful assassin puppeted by an aberration with the help of the old druid; which is why, at the end of the fight, the old druid died, and Canary had nothing to do but seek out the rest of the Primordial Heart.At first, he didn't really know what he was doing - it was just a goal to follow. But, as he tracked them, he started noticing more and more destruction in their wake, and began to suspect that more than one member of the party had been replaced by an Intellect Devourer, in the mad dash for the Surface; and that said devourer may be capable of reproduction.So that's where Canary's at, headspace wise. Short term goal, hunt down and destroy aberrations nearby. Long term goal, seek out the Primordial Heart, if necessary kill the Devourer(s?) in their midst, and gain closure for everything that happened to him and his village. Life goal, learn every language there is, so that someday, even without the Common tongue at his disposal, he could impress Sardior with the strange knowledge and story of his life."3/23/2018 10:11:36,Xandor Undoviel,Elf,Ranger,"Xandor Undoviel is an elven ranger from Dernall Forest on the island of Alaron, which belongs to the Moonshae Isles. He has been well-trained to fight against the goblin hordes that infest his forest home. As a young man he took on forester duties, but soon after reaching adulthood at 100 years, he joined a group of human and elven rangers called ""The Righteous Arrow"", which is led by the human ranger Dorn Strongbow and which wages war against the goblin infestation, often in cooperation with a group of druids called ""The Sacred Circle"".Dorn has taken Xandor under his wing and become his mentor. Xandor is also close friends with Thia Siannodel, a young half-elf ranger who is also a member of the Righteous Arrow. She and Xandor may have deeper feelings for each other but have never acted on those feelings. Finally, Xandor has become good friends with Benjen Snowraven, a human fighter who washed up on the shores of Alaron one day and joined the Righteous Arrow after being nursed back to health by the group.Less than a month ago, Dorn spotted a dragon cultist in Alaron. Intrigued, Dorn followed the cultist to Caer Callidyrr and watched her board a ship to Baldur's Gate. Leaving behind a message for Xandor that promised a quick return but unfortunately did not reveal his motivations, Dorn boarded the same ship to track the cultist to the mainland. But Xandor began worrying when Dorn had not yet returned to Alaron after two weeks, and he decided to search for him. Docking with a ship in Baldur's Gate, Xandor quickly discovered secret ranger signs that Dorn had left behind and tracked him through the Wood of Sharp Teeth to the Uldoon Trail in the Greenfields, but still hasn't found him.Xandor is an intellectual, logical, quiet person that doesn't easily show his feelings; this can be interpreted as coldness or aloofness but in actuality he has a lot of compassion and always tries to do the right thing. Through his experience in the Righteous Arrow where humans, elves, and half-elves work together against the goblins, and the broader cooperation he's seen across Alaron including dwarves, gnomes, and halflings, Xandor realizes the benefits of diversity and is not biased against other races. He is less familiar with exotic races such as dragonborn, tieflings, and githzerai, as they are very rare in Alaron, but he has read about them and is fairly open-minded toward those who are different.He wants to learn about the Sword Coast's geography, cities, races, and lore because the land is new to him. In the early morning hours after his trance, he likes to read books about Faerûn's history while the other party members are still asleep. He recalls the maps later with a photographic memory. Within the party, he favors the role of scout: stealthily preceding his companions on the lookout for traps, tracks, and enemies. If he discovers something, his job is to forewarn the party rather than engage alone. When the fighting starts, he prefers to keep his distance from the enemy and fire his crossbow. In battle, he favors a well-planned rather than spontaneous approach. He refuses to kill helpless enemies or torture them.He wants to help others and make the world a better place. To do that, he feels compelled to continuously improve himself in order to become ""the perfect ranger"". And to do that, he must enhance his skills and equip himself with the ideal items (discovered in books and from other people). In towns he visits, he often asks around about such items. He's also interested in learning rogue skills — not what he considers the ""negative"" ones like stealing, backstabbing, and assassinating — but the ""positive"" ones like discovering and disabling traps and picking locks. These are meant to complement his outdoor ranger skills with similar indoor skills that enable his party to proceed in its missions unimpeded and unharmed.Around his neck on a leather cord, as a memento, Xandor keeps a fang from the first worg he ever killed. He plays the flute proficiently but usually when others aren't around to hear. He has an idiosyncrasy where he often employs other people's full names and titles in everyday conversation."3/23/2018 10:13:53,Olon,Human,Wizard,"Olon, born with a club foot and abandoned by his birth mother, was raised in an orphanage not far from Pwyll, and was indentured to the Yellow Wizard at the age of seven.

In addition to training her magical abilities (and bringing the explosions under her direction, if not always control), she also studied the lives of the greatest of wizards (pulp serials, and the odd smutty magical romance). Now that she has been graduated (released), she has set her sights on becoming a world-famous witch."3/23/2018 11:00:58,Griftlok,Dwarf,Fighter,"I set out to adventure from the City of Schools.  Fresh out of the academy, my merry band of dwarves were enlisted to explore some infested caverns far to the south. We were ambushed by a band of kobolds who had been terrorizing a local village, but we beat them back.  We tracked them to their lair and flooded it with water from a nearby reservoir.  Our mission to the caverns ended in tradgedy with the loss of several of our company and without much gain in the ways of stories, treasure, or experience.Several weeks later we blundered our way into trying to infiltrate a thieves guild.  Without much in the way of deceptive qualities, we were quickly discovered in our mission and an all out war ensued on the streets for control of the city.  We eventually prevailed and took over the local thieves guild building.  We repurposed the building as an inn and trading hub.  This new hub brought many new characters to the town, including a troop of gypsies circus performers with mysterious demeanors and trinkets.  During this time we also sold our services to a local merchant who had been losing shipments to his warehouses to the southwest.  We loaded up in a boat and proceeded to travel to his warehouses to investigate the situation. No sooner than having stepped ashore, than we were beset by giant rat men with swords whom our weapons did little to slow.  We fought our way through the mass of rats to a nearby building, barricaded ourselves inside, and took some time to rest, heal, and formulate a new plan of attack.  With little time, our only option was to clear out the infested buildings.  We foolishly set fire to the warehouses and we did manage to clear out the infestation of were-rats.  Unfortunately, it also destroyed what was left of the merchant's property and sent him into bankruptcy and destitution and meant that we could no longer expect payment for clearing out the rats.The most significant occurrence is when our band was called back to the stronghold of our youth.  Great earthquakes had broken open sealed tombs in the royal crypts and the stronghold was under attack from trans-dimensional armies.  We returned home and made our way to the crypts with magic scrolls to seal them up.  We entered the tombs and found mud creatures coming out of the walls and stealing treasures from the dead.  A battle ensued in which I picked up the armor and axe of a great dwarven king from ages past.  We battled the creatures and managed to seal the tombs from intruders.  I then returned to the stronghold and, using the appeal of the relics I now wielded, I raised an army to perform a sneak attack  on the besieging army outside our walls.  We crushed their resistance and they fled back to their own dimension.  After the battle though I was confronted by the current king of the stronghold. I would not relinquish my new relics that I was now weilding for I believed myself to have been chosen to lead a crusade against our enemies and to crush those that stood against us.  The king banish our group from our home and we returned to our lives at the inn and trading post and had many more adventures from there."3/23/2018 11:01:15,"Angelica ""Angie"" Jones",Human,Warlock,"The earliest clear memory that Angelica Jones had was of sitting beside the mill pond and watching a frog slowly die. Her mother owned the mill, and the land along the river, in a farming community a thousand miles from the sea. She was the third of four living children, nearing nine years old in the spring, and a child like any other – by turns willful, curious, shy, laughing, angry, or any of the other moods that fill a child’s life. But today it was calm, and she had been skipping stones across the waters when a swift movement caught her eye. A snake lunged and bit at a bullfrog, and Angelica flung the stone in her hands, striking the snake in the side and startling it away. It disappeared in the grasses along the bank, and she forgot it as she knelt to watch the frog struggle. The frog kicked weakly, coordination gone as it bled in the mud. Then it only spasmed, then twitched, and then was still, even when Angelica poked at it.That was when she first heard her master’s voice, a long slow sigh in the still air. Would you burn? it asked, and she said aloud, “Yes.” And the frog was burning, and the grass was burning, and Angelica shouted in alarm and excitement and stamped out the thin flames amid the grasses and the greasy smoking frog, and because there are few things as dangerous as a fire near a grain mill, she had nearly forgotten everything but her fear by the time she ran back, out of breath.The next day she had a fight with another girl, and when she shouted, it was with a voice like thunder, and the fire was there, and that was another set of clothes ruined and another scolding. It grew from there, the growing flame inside her and the damage around her, the fear on the faces of the other children and the worried set of her mother’s mouth as she was beaten. Then came the knock on the door, late at night, and her master had come for her.A woman in tattered black stood on the doorstep, holding her hand out for Angelica. She was tall – too tall, inhumanly tall, bent down to reach for a child’s hand. She was bald, and her skin was a waxy yellow and spotted with age, and she smelled like damp earth and sweet rot, and Angelica didn’t care in the least as she was lifted up and held close. They traveled through the night, through cold empty air and tunnels of dirt, through places that chimed like bells as the moonlight twisted around them, and places where the slightest breath was a shriek. When morning came, she was home.The sunrise revealed an ivory spire, the Sea-Bone Tower, built from the bones of whales and leviathans, the teeth of squids and sharks. It also revealed the first of her sisters, Muire and Tess. They were also students and apprentices here; they hugged her and called her Angie, and made her welcome. Muire was the oldest, an elf wrapped in vines of holly, a soft-spoken historian and mentor. Tess was in the middle, a human with dyed pink hair, a poisoner and a friend. Angie was the youngest, completing the trio as she began her training.The first year was for learning, more than Angie had ever had before. Muire taught her history and politics, the names of figures known and unknown, maths and logic and rules of magic and scholarship. Tess taught her the thirteen classical poisons, anatomy and dissection and the secrets of life and death, blood and pain. Her master visited only infrequently, but taught her to call the fire in her veins and to strike with it. Muire also taught her the joy of reading, whispering softly aloud the fanciful tales of handsome witches and ages of adventure as they lay in bed feigning sleep. Tess taught her to run, and to cook, and held back her hair when she vomited out one of the fouler potions. And at the end of the year, when her master died in the dead of winter, Angie burned the old black rags in the fireplace where they held their vigil and waited for the master to return.The second year was for magic. Muire taught her runes and sigils, binding, cursing, and haggling. She also gave Angie the first volume of the chronicles of Tabitha, and showed her the secret corners of the library where the smutty tomes of dubious historical accuracy were tucked away. Tess helped her carve her first wand, and learn to see the glitter of magic, to tell a ward from a blight, and a charm from a curse. She also taught Angie to lie with a straight face, and helped pick up the pieces when she was caught. This was the year her master first killed her, passing her the bowl of poison and laying her on the table, catching back a piece of her death when that first new gasping breath again filled her lungs.In the spring of the third year, Muire left. They all cried together, and held a celebration with cakes and a far-too-good wine, and swore to be sisters forever. Before she left, she gave Angie a broom bound in iron, and made her promise to learn to fly it, and Angie instantly and forever forgave her for growing up tall and beautiful and swore that she’d only remain a little bit jealous. Some weeks later, her master left and returned with a new charge for them. Her name was Crane, and she was bleeding and fearful and would speak only a whisper when they met. Tess was the oldest now, and her skills could be turned to healing, and so she cleaned and bound the wounds while Angie cooked and drew a bath, and they learned of Crane’s slavery in the gladiator pits. Together, they were agreed – Tess would teach her how a woman fights, and Angie would help unlock the magic in her blood, and they would make her a great witch and a sister.At the height of that summer, their master gathered the three girls on the slopes in front of the tower in the early morning light. She spoke a grand spell and split open the air to let forth a torrent of salty water and a monster, summoning thirty feet of whale to a place that had never seen the sea. She bade them to kill it, and clean the bones, and prepare the flesh. For three days they worked without pause, surrounded by blood and fat and viscera. Tess brewed potions to chase fatigue and strengthen tired arms. Angie cut and sawed, with blades as large as she was and knives as small as her finger. Crane cooked and boiled and salted, casting wind to disperse the ceaseless crowding flies and throwing gobbets of flesh to the watching coyotes and foxes in the night. And at the end, they drowned Crane in a vat of blood and oil, to separate her spirit as they reshaped her flesh. And for all that they complained of the monotony, few things ever tasted as sweet as the whale steaks they ate afterwards.The fourth year passed in a blur. Crane grew taller than Angie, which was hardly fair when she was a senior witch to the other girl, but it couldn’t be helped. She studied more magic, learning to call other powers through the fire inside her, and to lend her power to others. She conjured with Tess while the other witch summoned ghosts, and she read with Crane, teaching her to study and learn. When her master died at the end of the year, Angie washed and oiled the body, while Tess whispered the secret name in her master’s ear.In the fifth year, for a short time they were four. The master of the tower brought them a young girl, covered in pox, one eye milky white and the other crudely sewn shut. They sat with her through the sickness, bathed away her sweat and cut open her eye to pack the socket with healing moss. Her name was May, and with her arrival, Tess’s smile grew thin and edged. One night, Tess came with her pack of poisons to say goodbye, leaving Angie with a brace of ritual daggers and a promise that they would be sisters forever. And then Angie was the oldest of the three witches.She dueled with Crane on the lawn, swirls and arcs of magic leaping back and forth between them. She sat with May while the other girl learned another sight, tearing open the veils of the past and future. She showed Crane the secret corners of the library, and they laughed together over the ridiculous romantic witches and their adventures, while vowing to have their own adventures one day. She taught May to cook, and May taught her to make tea, and they both fed Crane when she would forget her meals.  They were sisters together, and though she knew she would eventually leave, she loved them.As the time grew nearer, she made for Crane a goad, a wand and weapon and mark of authority all in one. For May she sewed a cloak, heavy and soft and weighted like the warmth of a hug. For herself she made a tall hat, and found a set of tall boots, because she wasn’t going to be this short forever, not if she could help it. And when her master told her there was a new world, and a ship to sail her there, Angie knew this was the start of her adventure. She would be a great witch, and make her sisters proud."3/23/2018 11:22:09,Sacha,Tabaxi,Cleric,"Grumpy old cat-person, pharmacist, occasional adventurer"3/23/2018 11:27:09,Book,Warforged,Fighter,"Book was forged to manage the library of a great wizard, a duty he faithfully performed for 100 years.

One day he came across a village being terrorized- by raiding kobolds, or a starving owlbear, or a power-mad undead dwarven tax collector (it was so long ago it really no longer matters)- and, inspired by many of the stories of heroism and bravery he had read and re-read, he stepped in and saved the townsfolk.

Leanora survived the sickness, and the con man, an elf named Baldan, noticed her nimble hands, and took some pity on her situation. Baldan took Leanora in and trained her in how to steal, charm, and con her way into a quick buck. Despite being her mentor, Baldan's pity only extended so far and he was not an affectionate figure in Leanora's life. Leanora did not realize this for most of her young life, until the pair got in a little too deep into trouble during a con. The two got caught and arrested. During her interrogation, Leanora realized that Baldan would sell her out to save his own skin if given the opportunity, so she beat him to the punch. She put all the blame on him, escaped, and got the hell out of dodge. Left with very little money even after their cons, due to a gambling habit, Leanora now found herself directionless.

This wasn't really a problem; they lived in an island fishing village that always needed sea witches, their uncle was a sea witch already. Unfortunately, unbeknownst to Brégevic - an only child - their mother was the last in a secret bloodline. They had been exiled from their home country hundreds of years ago, as members of a forbidden order of lorekeepers, and she wanted Brégevic to continue the tradition.Brégevic preferred consorting with the elements. After thoroughly wrecking their relationship, she gave in. Brégevic became a very competent, but very reckless sea witch. When they were twenty-five, they were approached in a bar by a fish person asking them to help a ship navigate the sea long past the season it should have been possible. They agreed, and the fish person sent them on their way and wiped their memory of the encounter.The voyage was a disaster; they limped into Brégevic's home village, halfway through the crossing, and many told them to winter there. It would be foolhardy to press on. Brégevic insisted. The ship set out, and was wrecked.Brégevic washed up on shore alone, the only survivor. They fled south, taking casual work as a dock hand despite their physical frailty, their confidence gone. They didn't contact their family again, too ashamed to admit their mistake. Eventually, they met several other misfit transients and decided to set up a private investigation enterprise together, and Brégevic slowly regained confidence in their skills."3/23/2018 13:22:03,Thashk,Orc,Bard,"""BANG.

Some of the members of the company owed their allegiance to the ducal family of Caermeirionshire, and others were affiliated with the Temple of the Sun.Rain was a senior commander in the Silver Company, a group of mixed Sun Soul monks and Caermeirionshire vassals during the end of the war, and Aldren Steelwing was the junior commander. Rain and Aldren have some level of name recognition / minor celebrity from that and from the bard’s song (more below).Notable BattlesBetrayal in the Silver City – Rain was involved in foiling a High Lord’s plot to betray the Temple and the Silver City from within.Rescue from the Mad Wizard’s Maze – Rain was captured by the enemy for several days and questioned about intel – Rain lied to the inquisitors in a way that led to escape/rescue. Aldren and Rokan led the rescue.The Battle of the Seadrake — Met and recruited Rokan of Kanutu.The Battle of the Maw: Rain risked burnout to help his cadre hold the front, and was left with visually distinctive sun-scars on both palms from channeling sunfire for too long.Since the warRain’s rejoined the monastery as a teacher and occasional diplomat with a particular interest in mending the harms left by the previous war and ensuring that the next generation of acolytes is better prepared in the event of the next war. In the absence of warlike hostilities Rain takes groups out into adventure-prone areas for training and mending.Some bard Rain kinda wants to strangle went off and wrote a stupidly popular song about the captivity and escape, and the battle that left Rain with star-scarred palms from fire channeling – not that it’s a bad song, it’s good enough to be popular and memorable, but Rain doesn’t like the reminders.He’s always taken care to be well-dressed and respectable-looking for both his house and his monastery, but he’s intent on impressing on the younger acolytes that good manners and ass kicking are not at all mutually exclusive.On a mission for the Relief Agency, Rain is captured by cultists (for the third time) and nearly sacrificed; Aldren and Rokan rescue him, and Aldren spends the next 7 years solid teasing him about “again? seriously? you need to break this habit, it’s bad for your health.”"3/23/2018 13:36:53,Ben,Human,Hacker,"People who met him online know him either as Kenobi or as Solo depending on whether they met him as a white hat/“Light Side” or black hat/“Dark Side” hacker/slicer/term du jour. People who met him in real life are sometimes not entirely sure how much is cosplay, how much is eccentricity, and how much is flat out nuts. He has a hackervan called The Falcon (because of course it is).Ben is so dedicated to his Jedi facade that he’s either delusional, the ultimate method actor, or an epic troll. Has a British / mid-Atlantic accent, but nobody’s sure whether it’s real, whether he’s convinced/deluded himself into thinking it’s real, or whether he’s constantly jerking everyone’s chain.Nobody actually knows his legal surname.

Apparently, a highway robber.

At night, by the campfire, he’d play dragonchess with Jingles, and frighten her with tales of the undead highwaymen who roamed the backroads—they were the competitors of still-living highwaymen, and she would have to learn to fight them off!Sadly, Jingles’ mentor died after getting run over by a nobleman’s carriage, and she’s since had to fend for herself—with mixed success. She lacks her mentor’s charisma, and has had to use her crossbow to shoot one or two drivers who wouldn’t acquiesce to her demands. To her own surprise, she feels little regret about this--like the Shrike (whose plumage hers resembles) Jingles finds it very satisfying to impale her victims on the ends of pointed sticks."3/23/2018 13:46:12,Ffion,Half-elf,Bard,"Ffion grew up on a smallholding in the middle of Golden Fields (northwest of Nightspell, near Left Hand River) as the only child of her human father Hywel Battlesea and her elven mother Jhaer Shacyne. Her childhood was not idyllic; she was expected to do her fair share of work and times could be lean if the harvest didn't come through. Nonetheless, she worked hard, even if it was just so she could finish faster and hide out in the fields to write poetry and compose little songs, her true passion.Her father was kind but also stern, and more than once Ffion found herself in trouble for letting the pigs out of their pen or encouraging the chickens to roost outside the barn (due in part to her conviction they'd be happier free, but she couldn't pretend it didn't make her happy to see the chaos a pig trying to get into the kitchen caused). Ffion grew up knowing her father expected her to take over the running of the farm one day, and his expectations weighed on her. Added to her mother's apparently inability to see that Ffion was maturing like a human child, not an elf, by the time she reached sixteen she had come to the decision that she had to run away.Still, it took another three years of plotting and saving the pennies she earnt by singing on market days and penning love poems for hapless farmhands before she eventually left home, and even then, it was the long-awaited birth of a baby brother, Rhys, that pushed her to take the plunge. She begged a place in a passing troupe of entertainers, the Lucent Chorus, winning them over with a flattering song and the promise that she was a good cook, and left a note telling her parents she was leaving for good.She spent the next several years travelling with that same troupe, honing her craft and learning how to draw a crowd and keep their attention. It was also with this troupe that she met the first man she'd truly fall in love with, Hallam Dain. A minor human noble (the fourth son, unlikely to inherit), they met in a tavern when she was performing in Oakengulf, and he pursued her respectfully but determinedly. When the troupe moved on from Oakengulf he insisted on travelling with them, and Ffion was charmed, taking him into her bed soon after. They spent a year together, but Ffion—young and trusting—didn't realise that behind her back, he was also pursuing another member of the troupe, a tiefling woman called Temerity who Ffion counted among her friends. The two lied to her for the entirety of that year, even making excuses when Ffion expressed worries to both that she and Hallam were growing apart. When Ffion discovered the deception, heartbroken, she left the troupe and went to the only place she could think of: her family's farm.Despite her fears that she would be rejected as Hallam rejected her, her parents welcomed her home with open arms, introducing her to not only her brother Rhys, now four years old, but a baby sister as well, Meredith. For the first time in her life, Ffion threw herself into the backbreaking labour of farm work, and came out stronger mentally as well as physically. When she left home again, it wasn't under cover of night but on good terms, and to this day she makes sure to visit her family at least every second year, sending home trinkets and letters when she can't be there.Since then, Ffion has most often travelled alone, though she has many friends across the continent, and more lovers. Unwilling to place her heart in danger again, she tends to pursue single nights with men and women who often have spouses at home, feeling sure it's better to know ahead of time that they can't commit themselves to her than to believe she deserves anything more.She is currently in Xaphingden City with the intention of performing for the royal family, as she's built up enough of a reputation over the years that there are nobles who will speak for her if she asks.Ffion has no idea that she has two full-blooded elf half-siblings from her mother's previous marriage. Her mother doesn't ever talk about her life before meeting Hywel, and all Ffion knows is that her mother's family were traditionalists who disowned her for marrying a human."3/23/2018 13:46:57,Blessing,Tiefling,Barbarian,"Born prematurely to a family horrified by her demonic features and glaucous skin, Blessing was abandoned at birth, exposed to the elements to die. She lay alone for almost a full day and night, kept alive by her higher body temperature and some primal determination not to give up on life.Near dawn on the day following her birth and abandonment, a nomadic clan of gnomes passed by and, alerted by the sound of crying, a woman called Mina Fairsteel discovered the baby. Mina was kind hearted, childless and filled with longing, and saw past Blessing's appearance, seeing only an infant in need of love and a family. She wrapped the baby in her cloak and took her at once to her wife, Teribeth, and the two agreed this child was the blessing they had been waiting for.Though the rest of their clan was not so quick to accept Blessing, the high status of the Fairsteels meant they were willing to take the chance, and as she grew up into a sunny, cheerful little girl, the whole clan came to love her as her two mothers did. And grow she did; slowly at first, but it soon became apparent that Blessing would end up half as tall again as her gnomish family. They never complained about Blessing's size to her face (and in fact, most welcomed it as a help) but after one too many incidents of too-small furniture broken, she came to think of herself as big and clumsy in comparison, and to this day tries to make herself small and unobtrusive whenever she can.Her teenage years came with another challenge. While she remained cheerful most of the time, Blessing became prone to mood swings and her temper was short enough to cause concern. After a bout of screaming rage that resulted in Blessing defiantly and deliberately breaking a beloved heirloom, her mothers decided enough was enough. Blessing needed an outlet for her anger and her strength, and fighting fit the bill in a way nothing else did. She showed a particular affinity for the greataxe, but her penchant for throwing herself into battle body and soul with little regard for her own wellbeing meant she was dangerous with all melee weapons, her fists included. On more than one occasion, merely her presence and reputation allowed the clan to avoid a bad situation becoming an all-out fight.On her twentieth birthday, she gave her mothers the heirloom, repaired, and received in turn a greataxe, forged and made for her in every way."3/23/2018 14:08:27,Gurdis Finknottle,Dwarf,Druid,"A mountain dwarf, she became intrigued by the eyeless amphibians deep in the caves.

She punched an offending soldier in the codpiece for mocking Bungletop's flower crown and he swore her a oath of service on the spot.Now they travel far and wide in search of crystals and bones and flowers to sell to aesthetic witches who want to look rustic without doing the work and are currently financing their first underground stronghold."3/23/2018 15:45:20,Linu Lomivazi,Half Arc,Fighter,"There's a popular phrase among children: ""Last one there's a rotten egg!"" It's supposed to be a challenge, ""We're now racing because the loser faces ridicule.""There's a slightly different saying used by conscriptors for the Iron Circuit's Cast Iron Brigade. ""The last soldier to muster is tortured to their death before the rest of the platoon."" This brigade was named because it was a melting pot of sorts; any time the numbers of the Cast Iron dwindled, the conscriptors used this line to get recruits from every background. Different homeland, different religions, different races. Half the soldiers couldn't even communicate with each other in the first rounds of recruitment and, for the most part, they didn't need to. The Cast Iron Brigade was faced with the missions that the more refined and homogeneous groups deemed too dangerous. The Front-Line, Sacrificial Lambs of the Iron Circuit army, so to speak.These conditions led to the rise of a few Champions. Linu Lomivazi wasn't planning on becoming one of those. She was second to last answering the conscriptors, she was first in line to watch as the last recruit was dragged out by the hair and tortured for two hours in the public forum. She was immediately, then, fearful of any part of the military and attempted every method she could to get out that also wouldn't get her executed. Every attempt failed, so horribly so that she earned the name Lomivazi, or ""Unlucky"" in the bastardized slang that formed in the camps.When basic training was complete, she ended up stronger than most after suffering the extra attention from the weapons masters who saw a need for discipline. When the first sortie occurred, Linu was one of the only 200 who returned from the front lines. Linu was the one with the most notches on her weapon. Linu was the one who took on the duty of calling the next draft. Over the next 5 years, Linu stayed with the Cast Iron Brigade as it was called to test the defenses of the Iron Circuit's foes. She grew to enjoy the thrill of a battle, she grew to be the shining example of foolhardy courage for the recruits who had to watch the last among them shrivel and die to the conscription. Eventually, she hit her 7 year promise and was released (forcefully) from military service. The woman who had tried to escape at every chance for the first two years was sad to see it go. So much so that she began searching for something to stoke that fire that was ignited in her by the Cast Iron Brigade. She went back to visit old friends in her home town when she ran into Vanyr who brought her attention to the summons of Rollo Brockhouse.Before her time in the military, Linu lived among the poor.The Purple stripe in her hair symbolizes power and mystery. Earned because of Linu's encounter with the slumlords who dominated the Iron Circle's poor district. Mystery because of Linu's heritage as a Half-Orc in a primarily Dwarvish and Halfling district.When Linu was living with the poor and dejected, she had to deal with the protection payments demanded by the slum lords just like everyone else. Linu had no skills in any craft and struggled to make the ends meet. When she couldn't, she had her bones broken and possessions taken. The only thing that never broke was her spirit as she vowed every day to pay back every pain she suffered.The monastery that fed and rested her came into the sights of the ruffians and she found herself stepping in to protect her source of food which put her in the good graces of Vanyr Oakenwood. After she found herself broken and bloodied and victorious, Vanyr is the one who nursed her back up. This started a friendship that lasted at least until Linu was conscripted to join the Cast Iron Brigade for the Iron Circuit. Linu did always respect the way Vanyr never backed down even when he was facing unwinnable odds.That's why she came back to check on him after her service. That's when she told him about her expedition north. He had to take care of some soup kitchen matters before he left so he promised to meet her at the encampment."3/23/2018 15:47:00,Tordek Strongarm,Dwarf,Paladin,"Tordek Strongarm comes from Citadel Adbar.

One day, Francis decided he'd had enough and vowed to be a force of change in the world.  He returned everything his father had ever given him- including the very clothes off his back- and left the estate naked.Francis eventually dedicated himself to the goddess of healing, who could physically manifest Herself and bestowed powerful divine magic upon him so that he could heal the subjugation wreaked on the impoverished masses.  During his adventures, Francis refused to handle or accept coin for services rendered, relying entirely on the donations of others for food, clothing, and shelter.One of the most confusing and stressful times of Francis' career as a celebrated cleric was his time in the Ashforth region.  While attempting to expose the town's reclusive mayor as a vampire and chase rumors of a dragon brood, he built rapport with the town's elders by leveraging his status as a cleric of a benevolent goddess who- he assumed, was a figure of power everywhere as proof of her existence was irrefutable.  In the end, the townspeople refused to believe his warnings or evidence that the mayor was indeed a blood sucker for infathomable reasons that still don't make any sense, nor did his impassioned cries for action against concrete proof that dragons WERE nesting in an abandoned church just outside of town.  The villager's bewildering actions aside, Francis met with further horror and confusion when his divine powers suddenly hinged on his ability to pay for them with jewels and gold.In all, it was a very stressful time and he left as quickly as possible, suspicious that he had wandered into a bizarro dimension."3/23/2018 16:37:47,Callie,Aarakocra,Druid,"She came from a village, and loves animals.

She was a fighter, not a dusty nosed scholar! When she came of age, she took part in the traditional Deep Hunt, as all young Tritons did, but she was blessed by a vision from Tempus, God of the Deep. Feloren hunted down the white squid and laid it on the altar to Tempus, and an ethereal tentacle took her sacrifice and pulled it deep into the inky dark. Then the tentacle touched her forehead, and she had a vision of herself as a glorious defender of the temple. When she awoke, she had been marked with a sucker print on her temple, where the tentacle had touched her skin. Awoken to her duty, Feloren forswore her previous life of luxury and lived instead for the glory of Tempus. For twenty years, Feloren was a glorious defender of the faith, as strong in her prayers as in her mighty arm. However, she forgot her duty for Tempus and drank heavily the night of the Blood Tide Festival, and a mighty host destroyed the temple while she slept in the marble halls of her father’s palace. The next day, Feloren woke to find that she was the sole survivor of a massacre - all Vuuzians around her had been slain by an unidentified weapon, and the temple desecrated. No trace of the killers was left behind. Crazed with grief, Feloren roamed the seas, fighting all comers, drinking dryland wine to ease her grief. She found no trace of the mysterious sea killers, and had given up hope, collapsing on the altar to Tempus to await her death.

As such, it came as no surprise when he decided to leave on his own journey of discovery.When he returned, however, Taggin was changed. He had learned things, as he had hoped, but the things he had learned were not meant to be known.

As a lowborn male, there wasn’t supposed to be much hope for him to advance in Drow society, or even survive. If he was lucky, he’d be strong enough to join the Drow’s military ranks, and perhaps rise moderately high enough to gain some respect before being assassinated by an underling.Yet Da’reth was not strong of body either, at least not enough to be a worthwhile soldier. And the frequent beatings he received did little to change that, although he did grow better at dodging.What he lacked in strength, however, he made up for in strength of personality and a creative mind. Where other Drow toiled away, he found a way to get others to handle his burden, as he composed quick little rhymes and ditties.Naturally, that was looked down upon in Drow society.One day, while out on basic patrol (also known as the position most likely to result in a quick death by invading adventurers), he came upon a party of travelers. Among them was a bard, who strummed away on his lute and improvising songs that had magical effects on his companions, in a very literal sense.So Da’reth introduced himself to the party, using his quick wit and clever tongue to convince them that he meant no harm. In fact, he assured them, the cruelty of the Drow was just a rumor spread by the outside world, that feared the creatures of the Underdark. When not under attack, the Drow were actually a welcoming species, and he would be more than happy to introduce them.Needless to say, he walked the adventurers straight into an ambush. But he picked up a few tricks from the bard along the way, and took the lute from the lad’s dead hands.From there, he practiced the bardic arts in secret, researching from the books he pilfered from the adventurers’ bodies. His ambush had earned him a little renown, but it was short and fleeting, and his curiosities were elsewhere. The outside world seemed to beckon to him, full of mysteries and opportunity for even a lowborn Drow such as himself.And so, on his next patrol, he deserted his post. In doing so, he let another band of adventurers through, and the damage they caused was surely enough to earn him an execution for his negligence. He’d tossed away any chance of ever returning to the Underdark, but he had earned his freedom, and that was worth far more."3/23/2018 23:07:10,Soren Oerkali,Aarakocra,Paladin,"Soren Oerkali was a typical Aarakocra, spending his days in flight and freedom. He had little in the way of aspirations, but being fit of body and charismatic, it was still assumed that he’d do well in life.In fact, his opportunity to prove himself came earlier than expected, when a group of bandits tried attacking his hometown. Soren was the first to rush to fight them off, and the sight of an enraged bird-man, swiping away with his talons, was enough to frighten off the invaders.Naturally, praise was heaped upon him afterwards, because why would it? He was, after all, the hero of the day. In fact, his fellows were beginning to compare him to the paladins who patrolled the countryside, fighting evil wherever they found it.That sounded like a pretty good career path to Soren. After all, paladins fought in the name of righteousness, so if he became a paladin, he could fight as much as he wanted, and it would be the righteous thing to do. The logic, he determined, checked out.After saving up enough to afford weapons and armor, Soren made his debut as the “paladin of the skies,” as he liked to call himself. Sure, he wasn’t entirely sure what being a paladin entailed, or what he’d have to do to truly become one, or the great risk he was taking on himself by journeying out into the unknown with no formal training or experience, but he was fairly certain he’d be fine. After all, there was evil to smite, and he was looking forward to starting the smiting."3/23/2018 23:07:32,Yorelin,Wood Elf,Rogue,"Don’t bother asking Yorelin what his full name is, he wouldn’t remember. After all, his family name was taken from him the same time his family was; the fact that he even remembers his first name instead of just “Cabin boy” is a blessing, although he could be remembering it wrong anyways.At a young age, his elven outpost was attacked by a band of raiders, who slew his family and took him as a prisoner. He was handed from captor to captor for a while after that, until he ended up enslaved by the Drow pirate, Kirth’et. He was to be kept as a cabin boy for a short while, until they next returned to the Underdark and made him an offering to the spider goddess Lolth.That return trip took longer than anticipated, though, so he spent a good amount of time on the ship, where he had to learn to steal whatever he could to survive - food to keep through the day, a blanket to keep through the night, and whatever else he could to keep his hopes alive of ever making an escape. In secret, he watched the pirates fight, and tried his best to pick up on their swordplay as well (though any time he was caught doing so, he was then used as a training dummy by the rest of the crew).One day, however, he did manage to make his escape. In the middle of a raid, he let himself get knocked overboard, and swam to safety as far as he could. There, he washed up on the Sword Coast, a battered Elf, but a free Elf.One would think that his life would have taught him to be compassionate to those not as well off as him, to compensate for the cruelness that he was shown. One would be wrong, in such a case. For he had grown hardened, and greedy, and after losing all the world had taken from him, he was determined to take all that he could, wherever he could, from whoever he could.Other people had done nothing to help him; other people had used him and sold him. So why should he care for anyone else? No, other people were just tools to be used, and a disarming smile while calling them “friend” was the best way to use them. After all that he had been through, Yorelin was hard to phase, and learned to keep a smiling poker face in any situation. His time on the high seas among pirates had made him an expert smuggler as well, which he took as his profession. But should his possessions be put at risk, he’d show no mercy nor kindness, and when given the choice between riches and the wellbeing of other people, he’d pick riches every time."3/23/2018 23:08:04,Ereldril,Half-Drow,Wizard,"To look at the history of a Half-Elf, one must first look at their parents, especially in the case of a Half-Drow such as Ereldril. How could it be that a Drow and Human could consummate, given the nature of Drow society?Ereldril’s mother was a Drow from a decently ranked house in Menzoberranzan; not high enough for a place in the council, but well enough to get by with decent respect. As such, the house could often afford certain status symbols, such as one-time adventurers turned slaves.It seems there’s never an end to the adventurers seeking to root out evil by venturing into the Underdark, but so many are unprepared for the dangers that await within. So when one human expedition was captured, their captors opted to sell them to nobles; a fair amount of noble houses enjoyed forcing lesser beings to bow to their whims, and once they grew bored of their slaves, they made decent sacrifices to Lolth.That was how Ereldril’s parents met, with his father as captive to his mother. The strong-willed adventurer was not easy to break, and often required some charm or domination spells to be fully compliant, until a combination of the constant magic manipulations and Stockholm Syndrome made him eager to serve his mistress.Naturally, such affection disgusted the Drow, who found increasingly life-threatening tasks to give her slave. Yet he carried them all out, time and time again, proving himself particularly hard to kill, so long as he could win her favor.Eventually, in a moment of curiosity and weakness, she decided to lay with the human. Thus, Ereldril was conceived.For a Drow noble to give birth to a vile half-breed would normally be enough to make her house not only lose Lolth’s favor, but lose its standing altogether. So Ereldril’s birth was kept secret, and after much prayer, it was decided that the house would maintain Lolth’s favor only so long as Ereldril remained a true Drow. Naturally, his human father had to be sacrificed to Lolth as part of the deal.Thus began Ereldril’s upbringing, to the same harsh standards as any Drow, and then some. With his Human blood, he lacked certain talents that came naturally to other Drow, though fortunately he inherited the natural ability to cast certain spells. He was expected to always have Disguise Self cast upon himself before going outside, so as to hide any signs of his Human heritage, and only show his true face to a very select few.Among those few were the house’s weapons master and mage, who trained him from a young age, as they would any other Drow children of the house. What Ereldril lacked in physical strength, he made up in finesse and quick-thinking, and he quickly took to magic and light weapons. Together, his instructors taught him the way of the Bladesinger, seeing his natural talent for weaving weapons and spell craft.Of course, Lolth later had them both turned into Driders for teaching Bladesinging to one who carried human blood, but that came long after.Eventually, a unique opportunity came to Ereldril, as his house was tasked with connecting with a certain faction outside of the Underdark. Fearing the light of the sun, many Drow declined to leave, but Ereldril realized that this was one case where his Human traits could perhaps come in handy; as a Half-Drow, his Darkvision wasn’t nearly as great as that of his kin, but he in turn lacked their sensitivity to the sun. As such, he was chosen as the house’s representative, and went to the surface, where he eventually joined the Lord’s Alliance. By forging an alliance between his house and those in the faction, he could provide his family with a link to the world outside the Underdark, and several important connections they could later use."3/23/2018 23:08:31,Phyll Nerkon,Human,Wizard,"When Phyll was a young child, he was part of a caravan with his family. His father was a merchant, not one of much wealth, but he did well enough for them to get by; he sold gear to adventurers, but he never thought he’d be caught up in any epic battles himself.Of course, the caravan was attacked by an evil necromancer and his army of the undead. Traveling heroes managed to save the day, but the  moment stuck with Phyll.“Why should undead only be used for evil?” he wondered. “Think of all the good they could do if utilized right.”He realized the the undead could serve more purposes than just attacking caravans and guarding evil lairs. There are plenty of tasks that skeletons and zombies could be put to work at - street cleaning, security, plowing fields, the list goes on.So Phyll began studying to be a wizard; he was an intelligent young lad, so his family used what money they had to get him books on magic that he diligently poured over, until he began getting a grasp of the basics of magic, with the focus of his studies on necromancy. Eventually, he was ready to head out and explore the world.Phyll has a dream for the future, a world where the undead are used to carry out society’s menial tasks, allowing a degree of comfort for all who live in it, and the freedom to pursue their passions. In return for fulfilling, safe, and comfortable lives, people would willingly allow their bodies to be used after death as the undead workforce for a time, paying back the society that has provided for them.Of course, consent is always important, particularly when animating the dead. So don’t be surprised if he asks early on if you’re okay with him animating your corpse should you die during the quest, at least until they can find a cleric to properly revive you."3/23/2018 23:08:54,Thelaw Jujurex,Goliath,Paladin,"Once, a band of goliath barbarians ventured down from their home in the mountains to raid a nearby village. Unfortunately for them, the village just so happened to be home to a band of paladins, united as members of the Order of the Gauntlet.Suffice to say, the raid did not go well.By the time it was over, only one goliath still lived: a newborn child, carried into war on his mother’s back. The paladins agreed that, though his kin may have been invaders, the child was blameless, and decided to raise him as a member of their order.So the child was raised, a goliath among humans (and the occasional elf and dwarf), to be a paladin like no other. Strong, fearless, and utterly devoted to upholding the law. Should any break society’s rules under his watch, he had the might and the guidance to be judge, jury, and executioner. He is the shield that protects order, and the sword that delivers its judgement. He is Thelaw Jujurex, and he delivers justice in the name of the law."3/23/2018 23:09:14,Lilth'et,Drow,Cleric,"Lilth’et is the younger of twin sisters, born to a priestess of Lolth. Naturally, her mother raised them both to follow in her footsteps, while slowly working to earn her place as the matron of the house over her own sisters. (As Drow, of course that included a fair amount of poison and backstabbing, but that’s only natural.)Lilth’et’s older sister, Kirth’et, decided she had other plans. Though still loyal to the spider queen, she felt her talents were best used outside of the Underdark, and went off to become a pirate, of all things. Yet she managed to consistently deliver goods and sacrifices to the family, so Lolth remained pleased.Lilth’et’s mother would never see her dream of becoming the matron fulfilled, as she came down with a nasty case of dagger to the throat. That left Lilth’et herself to carry on as she’d been raised, continuing her unceasing servitude to the spider queen and scheming her way to the top of the house.She was good, too. Quite good at maintaining Lolth’s favor, not being around when her rivals happened to perish, and avoiding would-be assassins of her own. So good, in fact, that the house’s matron took notice of her skill and ambition, and decided to give her a special mission, well outside of the Underdark.So Lilth’et was sent to join up with the Zhentarim, and carry out some missions for the faction on behalf of her house, in return for certain favors from the family.

Those who vanquish evil and save the day are forever remembered in poetry and music, tales of their brave deeds echoing through taverns, around campfires, and in the ears of those who hear them.A young kenku grew up listening to those songs, and could repeat them backwards and forwards at a moment’s notice, as kenku do. He’d spend hours around taverns and courtyards, listening to the remarkable tales the bards sung of - the man called Jayne, the continuing story of Bungalow Bill, and the story of St. Jimmy, to name a few. Every drinking song, from Bink’s Sake to songs about pina coladas, reached his ears as well, though nothing engaged him as much as songs about heroes of renown.The kenku wanted nothing more than to be the hero of such a song, and he studied the bardic arts, repeating every song he heard to perfection. There was only one problem: he couldn’t come up with his own. Kenku, after all, are cursed to have an absolute lack of creativity, so while he could play back anything, he couldn’t compose one for the life of him.Well, there’s only one solution to that: he’d need someone else to write a song of his exploits, and to do that, he’d have to have some exploits in the first place. So he set out on a journey of his own, hoping to be the very best, like no one ever was, so that people would one day sing his name.Some people call him the space cowboy. Some call him the gangster of love.

Although he's a human, most of his comrades are planar beings of pure law and logic, offering him few opportunities to embrace his emotions.The guild is based in Kaliopteris, a secluded bubble of space somewhere in the outer planes, near the realm of the lawful deities. Kaliopteris was once, itself, a being named Kaliopter who believed so deeply in ensuring the safety of time that he committed his very being to creating the guild and its home.Yan came to ""join"" the guild by happenstance. While investigating a temporal anomaly in a far-off realm, a group of agents found a timeline on the verge of collapse after a magical curse was triggered by the birth of a king's first child. Everyone and everything that existed before the child's birth was doomed, but the child could still be salvaged. When the agents returned to Kaliopteris, they had no choice but to raise the orphaned child as one of their own, naming him Yan.Being one of the only humans in the guild, Yan found it an odd fit. He could never be quite as cold or calculating as his purely logical comrades, and his curiosity sometimes left him at odds with his superiors. Shortly before he was cleared for field duty, however, he discovered the case file detailing the destroyed world and timeline he was to be born into.Struck with conflict, not content to live a life unfit for a creature of emotion, Yan jumped into a foreign timeline on a routine mission before destroying his temporal anchoring device, leaving him stranded in the material world and among his own people.From there, he sought a way to live a relatively normal life, doing things the way normal people do, living in a community and making friends without having to skulk around behind the curtains of history. Still, it's been hard to leave his training and habits behind; socializing has been particularly difficult.He wants to matter, and to be remembered.

Originally a settlement of dwarves and humans, it fell to the Thousand Fists orc tribe over four generations ago and the survivors were enslaved. There had already been mixed blood between the dwarf and human populations, and some orc blood passed into the slave population as well. Though he seems human in stature and most features, Iorad has a powerful, stout build and an unusual gray cast to his skin, perhaps a hint at mixed ancestry.The lives of most slaves were short and brutal, and Iorad often fought both with the orcs to fend off the monstrous threats in the mountains, and against the orcs to protect the weaker slaves. The settlement was ruled by Rugud the Howler, an orc with some shamanic power. In Iorad's teen years, a party of Bloodaxe Mercenaries from Sundabar found the lost outpost, and battle ensued. Iorad helped drive out the orcs, but Rugud collapsed a cavern, escaping and killing most of the other slaves.Iorad returned to Sundabar, finding work with his immense strength until he was found by Teppers, a halfling leader of a mercenary party called the Death Caps. Teppers' tall tales and fine mushroom wines enchanted Iorad, and he joined his mercenary group, along with Hawktree the human ranger and the elven siblings Llideth and Bealias.Iorad traveled with the Death Caps for many years, content to follow a clever leader and enjoy the entertaining atmosphere they had at camp. However, he was easily fooled and grew to love gambling, quickly losing his wages at any new town.On one occasion, the Death Caps were hired to protect a secret location for the trade of rare magic items. Iorad, however, found himself in debt to a Zhentarim woman named Tatarra the Red Glove, who ran the gambling establishments in the nearest town. In exchange for relieving his debt, Iorad divulged the secrets of the location and its defenses. The Zhentarim acted on this information to strike mercilessly, slaughtering the other Death Caps and the merchants. Iorad was left alive, taunted by Tatarra, and fell into a vagrant and meaningless life until he met Augustine, saving him from a giant serpent in a ruin in the Southwood."3/24/2018 2:28:57,Juanfendrel Pedrolofar,Elf,Rogue,"Elf assassin from Mexico, sworn to climb over the wall of Mordor."3/24/2018 4:35:25,Mariya,Half-elf,Bard,3/24/2018 5:50:47,Bear,Bear,Druid,"Originally a circus bear, a slight magical accident gave Bear advanced intelligence.

Born to a wealthy family of academics, it was assumed early on that Ollie, the second oldest child, would continue on the grand tradition of the Porters. While Ollie did very much enjoy study, they found themselves not only wrapped up in tomes of history and magic, but also fictional works of great heroism. The idea of being in the back lines - at best - slinging magic spells quickly lost its appeal, though they dutifully, for a long time, at least studied as their parents asked.Enrollment into the Lyceum was a given - practically a family tradition. Ollie got good marks, but constantly felt a pull of wanting to do something more than sit among books their entire life. Troubled by the pulls of obligation and choice, they spent much of their childhood silently miserable. They likely would've remained that way, too, if not for him happening upon a duel in the streets of town.Ollie was utterly enraptured by the scene. The winner dispatched the man with a few clean motions, leaving the thug unconscious on the ground. While most went on their way after things settled, they quickly went over to introduce themselves to the Half-Elven woman who they'd come to know as Eliora. Eliora, a woman recently retired from military life, was amused at this young scrap of a person asking her to train them to be as good as she was with the sword for coin, but their clear drive was enough to grab their interest. The amount they could pay up front didn't hurt.Eliora would become a good friend and mentor as Ollie proved themselves to be more than just a child trying to play hero. They threw themselves into swordsmanship like they threw themselves into anything - with an almost insatiable drive to be the best at it. Still, having to hide the training created a bit of a double life for them, and they quickly started to find it overwhelming to juggle both the side of them that wanted to be an academic and learn about the arcane and the side that wanted to become the hero they always dreamed of being. What's worse, their parents found out about their little trips into the city to train and didn't take it well. After the discussion devolved into a fight, their relationship was strained to a breaking point.Refusing to give up on their dreams, they decided to go beyond their schooling - which really offered them nothing for their problem - and visited the local curiosity in town. Gilmore had quite a reputation among students, and it was clear very quickly why. The man was easier to talk to than Ollie ever imagined such a known figure could be, and they found themselves confiding in him what was happening and what they wanted to do - to find a balance somewhere. After considering the dilemma, they went into the back and returned with a book that was as old looking as some of the oldest in the Lyceum's library.This might be of use, he promised. He hadn't been lying. Enchantment had always been a bit of a focus subject for Ollie, and the book, written by an unknown author who Gilmore could only say was probably from the Rifenmist Peninsula area, spoke of something that went far beyond that. They realized they could build on what was clearly someone's unfinished research on the topic, which they realized just in time for all hell to break loose.Thordak changed everything. Suddenly they were thrown out of their comfortable student life and he could do nothing but watch it all burn. In the ensuing time between the attack and the taking back of Emon, Ollie quieted the panic of losing contact with literally everyone they cared about by throwing themselves into their research. They realized they could essentially use runes on his weapons, armor, and even body to tap into their innate magical talents. Though the ensuing time often involved failures at best and near brushes with actual injury at worst, they eventually found success. Their training with the arcane as well as their martial training finally found a connection point.It became their project, their obsession. When it became clear they would have to mark their body to get some of the magic spoken inside to work, they didn't hesitate, even though the Academy would've expressly forbade it. It didn't take him long to unlock the secrets of the book, and he found reason to believe that perhaps it wasn't the only one.Perhaps there was still things yet to find.When the Academy began asking for volunteers to go to the corners of the world to begin rebuilding the Academy's lost libraries, they were among the first to sign up, surprising even their teachers when they chose one of the most dangerous assignments - into the Rifenmist Peninsula. It was of course on purpose - they knew, after all, the book they'd been given had been found in that area. With little reason to question their motives, they agreed to allow them leave from the Academy for more...hands on experiences.They weren't stupid, though. They knew it wasn't a journey they could take alone. When it was clear none of their fellow peers had any interest in the area, they turned to a tavern to see if anyone was looking for a shield while traveling. As it turned out, there was..."3/24/2018 6:54:49,Renos Agurto Sitorus,Halfling,Fighter,A good thug. How?

Their drive to self-sacrifice is fiercely competitive, much to the annoyance of their human fellows. Whirl's air genasi nature is a source of pride for them. Despite their constant attempts to help, their village never fully accepted them.

Having two other siblings, one being my twin sister Kariana, and the other, an elder brother of 5 years, Mathias.  We were raised to follow in our parents footsteps among the clergy though Mathias was resistant and I wasn’t too interested.  Our home, the temple, was located in the Castle district of the capital city Orphia. We were looked upon in high regard by everyone in the city, including the King.	Mother and father were always busy in matters of church and state so we grew to see other members of the clergy as more of a family. Growing up, my sister and I were the best of friends while our brother grew distant, and would avoid being around us as much as he could. Often I would catch Mathias sneaking off somewhere and I would follow. He would make his way to an abandoned cellar where he had stacks of books. There he would spend hours on end reading and what seemed to be him attempting magic. One night he caught me as I knocked something over watching him from the doorway, he spun around and launched a ball of fire in my direction, hitting the stone wall beside me. “What are you doing here?!” He yelled. “I-I’m sorry big b-brother… I was just curious..!” I replied as he stomped over and grabbed my wrist. “Don’t tell ANYONE what you saw!” he replied as he started dragging me back to the temple.	The years passed, I told no one about what I saw, though I don’t know why he was so secretive about it. I would often go and hang around soldiers as they trained, and I liked to try my hand at different weapons they had laying around. I got decent at a few but I didn’t quite find anything I was good at. My sister spent her time doing what our parents wished and learned the ways of being a cleric. I studied it as well but I was not as diligent as her nor as skillful. 	On the eve of Kariana and my sixteenth birthday alarm bells started ringing in the dead of night waking everyone up. There was smoke in the air accompanied by the sounds of fighting. Kariana and Mathias were nowhere to be found. Rushing out, there was flames and bodies everywhere, but not all the bodies were still. The guards were cutting down troves of undead, yet they kept coming. I grabbed a sword off a fallen guard and went searching for my siblings. After I had looked everywhere within the temple I remembered the place I had followed my brother to years ago. I made my way out of the temple grounds and into the city, where things were just as bad as inside. Using all I had learned I made it with only a few scratches and found the door locked. “Brother! Kari! Are you in there?!” I yelled as I pounded on the door with my fist. There was no reply but I could hear sounds coming from within.	Throwing my shoulder into the door a few times, I managed to burst into the room, where I happened upon a horrific scene. The room was aglow in unnatural lights, with sigils and runes painted everywhere in what seemed to be blood. Mathias was standing there with his back toward me over an alter that was not there the last time I had been here. Staring for a moment I suddenly was able to recognize that upon the alter laid Kariana, motionless, but a horrified look on her face. “Ah, took you long enough, dear sister. I’m sorry to say you’re too late, you’ve missed all the fun!” Mathias said as he slowly turned to me. He was completely covered in blood and in his hand he grasped a still beating heart. “I was hoping you would be first, but it seems the fates chose our dear sister instead.” He said with a large unnatural smile creeping along his face. I stood there, speechless, tears starting to well in my eyes and I started to stumble towards him. Before I could get close, the heart, still beating started to be surrounded by a purple miasma then burst into a hellish flame. “Ah, don’t worry.” he said in a cheerful voice. “Our dear sister wants to greet you as well!”	With that her body convulsed violently for a moment, then sat up, turned on the table and stood there. Her face still frozen in horror and her chest cavity was exposed as if something had burst forth from it. “WHY HAVE YOU DONE THIS MATHIAS?!” I screamed at him while tears were falling from my eyes like waterfalls. “WHAT DROVE YOU TO THIS MADNESS?!”	“Madness? No. THIS IS NOT MADNESS! I WILL SHOW YOU, OUR PARENTS, EVERYONE WHAT TRUE MADNESS IS!” He replied screaming back at me.	With that my sisters body ran towards me, distorting it’s features, her legs elongated and twisted, spines started protruding along her back and arms. As she swung at me, her fingers grew into long claws and her eyes went black. Before I could react she sent me flying backwards into the wall hard enough to crack the stone.	“You see sister, don’t you think she’s more useful like this? You will turn out even better! Mother and Father won’t be able to ignore me any more!” he exclaimed walking over to me.	Time seemed to stop. For a moment I laid there in silence in a pool of my own blood. The pain wasn’t present, and there was no sound for what seemed forever. Then out of nowhere a voice, “I task you with cleansing this blight your blood has wrought upon the world. End those that would corrupt the world and the natural order and be a protector of life.” As the voice faded my body felt as if I was being embraced, it was warm and my body seemed to knit itself back together. Then time flowed again, my brother stood over me with my sister, who aside from her face with the same frozen look, was unrecognizable.	I stood up, grabbing my sword, and turned to face him. “Oh you still have some fight left in you? He sneered. “We’ll have to fix that then, dear sister, if you’d please?” And Kariana’s body lunged forward again. Before I knew I reacted, my blade bathed in a radiant glow and in one swift motion removed her head, ending the flourish with me standing in front of my brother and the sword through his chest.  With a shocked look on his face he spat up blood on to me. “Heh… Well I’ll be seeing you shortly… Dear… Sister…” Where his last words as we both collapsed to our knees. I stayed there sobbing, for what seemed like ages, until I passed out.	When I awoke I was in my mothers bed, an acolyte was sitting by the door reading a book. She took notice of my stirring and ran out of the room yelling for my mother. Moments later my parents, along with a few others from the clergy walked into the room. I sat up, but before I could say anything my mother rushed over and wrapped her arms around me. “Where is Kariana? Where is Mathias? Please tell me I was only having a nightmare...” I uttered in a raspy voice. With that she squeezed me harder and I could hear a couple of the priestess’ crying. “They… are gone. We thought we had lost you as well… You’ve been asleep for over a week now and even my gifts could not wake you.” Mother said  as she pulled back to look at me. 	“I… Something, someone spoke to me… I think it was Bahamut… They felt warm… Like this… Oh! What about the undead that was attacking?!” I asked, concerned. Father walked up, handed me a cup of water and said “They were dealt with. There were plenty of injuries but...” Mother interrupted him with “There will time for that later, for now let her get her strength back.”	After that I had explained everything to them that I had witnessed, going back to me following him years ago. They did not doubt what I told them about hearing a voice. They also explained to me that after the fighting had ended they could not find us so they used a spell to lead them to us. Staying silent on what they saw, they told me that going through things in the room it was uncovered that the undead were Mathias’s doing but he was being taught, coerced by another. As they spoke, my eyes uncontrollably started to well up once more. They decided that was enough for now and had me rest some more.	Time passed, and I felt as if my task the voice had given me was not over yet. I started training in the ways of the paladins, there are several oaths one can take but there was one that stood out to me. An obscure oath that not many followed because of how it seemed to be of a more sinister nature. However it fit perfectly with what the voice had asked me to do. This was the Oath of Death. Many see it as something to fear, however death is only natural, and those that would disrupt the order should be ended. Though not entirely happy with my decision, my parents did not try to stop me.	I never let the events escape my mind, but instead of letting them chain me down, I used them to fuel my actions. In my brothers notebooks he would detail his encounters with his benefactor, a man who used the name Carthapilus. The notes told of long rants the man would go on about society and how people who did not use their life to the fullest did not deserve it. Though unsure of how accurate the accounts and descriptions of the man were, I had memorized them and kept the books on my person at all time, in search of this man.	More years passed, with my training completed I went traveling with a group of adventurers. We had our ups and downs but we became good friends, helping people, exploring dungeons, etc. Along the way I gathered more clues on the man I hunted. I also grew close to one of the men traveling with me by the name of Timon Court. He was a roguish sort, devilishly handsome, yet withdrawn from most interaction with other people. We shared our pasts and eventually decided to share out future. Getting married in my home city, with my mother being the one to head the procession. We wanted a small ceremony but with who my family was and the good our group had done there were countless people there. Afterwards we continued with our companions on our journeys, though a few months later we learned I was pregnant and decided for the time being we would take a break.	My daughter was born to us when I was twenty one and we named her Aislin Kari Hearthburn. Three years had passed before my restlessness couldn’t be quelled any longer and I set back out. Timon stayed at our home, he felt his days adventuring were over.	In my travels we discovered the man I was looking for was a disgraced baron lording over a secluded city in the mountains. Hordes of undead patrolled the streets but they weren't attacking the people, who looked disheveled and worn down. Not daring to take on the hordes with only the handful of us we stealthily entered and talking to people found there was an underground resistance. We devised a plan for an all out attack, they would deal with the undead while we entered the manor and dealt with Cathaphilus. The battle wasn’t that long, the undead he commanded were many, but weak. He himself was no fighter, when he was beaten and bleeding out, I told him who I was, his only reply was a guttural blood filled laughter. I had finally finished what I set out to do so long ago but I didn’t know if I should have felt relieved or frustrated.	I returned to my home and family with the news, deciding that my life on the road with finished. I visited the graves of my siblings often, told my daughter stories about the good memories I had with them and about my travels as she grew. I took up new responsibilities in the monastery such as teaching new acolytes and acting as a midwife to those in the city.	One night while taking my bath, there was a noise behind me. I figured it was Timon coming to join me.

He is hunchbacked and burn-covered, and the left side of his face is paralyzed in a grimace. Lacking eyebrows and his head a web of scar tissue, Muspell prefers to shave off what little black hair still grows there. His slate-grey eyes are rarely visible because of the dark-lensed goggles he keeps on unless he is underground. To avoid stares in very populated areas, Muspell usually hides behind his illusion magic. He is gruff in all senses of the word but also sagacious. He is paranoid, neurotic, and has a short, violent temper, but is ultimately good-hearted and fiercely loyal to those who have won his trust. He speaks little of the Underdark, so full of shame and trauma is the memory of his time there. He despises drow.Muspell was born during the Festival of the Star in the gnome city of Hypogaia Though birth at such a time is usually considered an auspicious omen, Muspell’s life has been anything but lucky. Nearly strangled by his own umbilical cord, it was only through the intervention of a skilled midwife that he survived his first day. He was the only child of his family, and unusually happy and curious. He was always poking around the forbidden corners around his family’s property, a sly grin on his angular face.Muspell idolized his father Surtr, a mighty breachgnome who answered directly to the king. Shortly after his family was moved to the outskirts of the territory for a long term assignment, they were attacked by a band of drow. Muspell’s father was on patrol when the drow came; Muspell hid successfully but had perfect view of the drow as they viciously raped and butchered his mother. When Surtr returned, he vowed vengeance upon the dark elves and departed with his son in tow.Muspell spent his adolescent years deep in the drow tunnels following his father in his quest for revenge. Father and son spoke but minimally, numb to all feeling but rage. Surtr, a gnome possessed, provided but the barest essentials for his son’s survival as he cut his way through the drow ranks. Eventually making their way to the temple of the drow priestess that ordered the raid, Muspell and his father stumbled into a chamber with a surprise - a chained red dragon. The dragon attacked instinctively with its flame breath. When Muspell came to, his body seethed with pain of a full body burn.    As a slave of the drow priestess he’d come to kill, he often wished he’d succumbed to his injuries that day. Muspell was beaten daily and nearly driven mad by starvation, surviving only on carrion rats and mold scraped from corners of his cell. The priestess loved to tease him about his dead father as she forced him to do humiliating acts for her entertainment, ranging from the sadistic to the sexual. He managed to escape his cell one night while the priestess did battle with a rival in the nave of her temple. While sneaking out, Muspell stole a book from under an altar, hoping its pages might provide some nourishment for his aching belly. Somehow making his way outside of the city, he opened the book. The eldritch tome contained profane secrets unfit for a sane mind, and would have killed him outright with its energies if he were not already half insane. The experience left the poor young gnome in a coma.  Muspell would not awaken until nearly a year later, back in the city of his birth. Though the book was nowhere to be found, its evil had infected his psyche, the images within burned into his brain. He was physically rehabilitated and adopted by a family friend, the illusion mage Segojan Seamseeker. Unfortunately, Muspell’s mind had been warped by his traumatic childhood in such a way that he exhibited antisocial behavior frequently, eventually driving him to close himself off from even his would-be guardian. Forswearing all kinship, he threw himself into physical training, hoping to join the king’s forces to avenge his parents. He was rejected, however; years of abuse and malnourishment during his younger years had left him stunted and weak. Broken, Muspell attempted suicide by hanging himself.He awoke with Segojan standing over him. “Your sword arm may not be strong, but you possess a strength far rarer.” Segojan pointed to his head. “That of the mind. Study under me and channel your pain into a power which will aid you in your goal.”Muspell saw no other path. He was simply not strong to be a miner or gemcutter, he thought. He accepted. He started his studies late, but by adulthood he’d overtook his apprentice peers in magical proficiency. He simply had the knack. The confidence that accompanied this proficiency produced an emotion quite alien in him: confidence. Muspell began, cautiously, to try his hand at courtship. The object of his affections was Frigga Seamseeker Though Segojan carried many reservations about a relationship between Muspell and his daughter, he withheld them with the hope that Muspell and his daughter, who was herself troubled by mental illness, might find mutual comfort.Frigga was apprehensive at first. Muspell was kyphotic and scarred from head to toe, marked by dragonfire and drow’s whip. His demeanor was vulgar and uncultured. Yet, within him she saw the boy that once explored caves fearless and with a permanent smile, the boy whose only joy was nuzzling his mother’s neck. They married in the Temple of the Earthcaller, and for the first time in his life, Muspell wept with joy.All seemed to be well, but for one thing. Months went by and Muspell failed to consummate the union. He was simply... impotent. Muspell came to realize to his great shame that he was only sexually attracted to drow. Frigga tried to be understanding but grew impatient. She wished for children. The indignance turned into arguments and the arguments turned into yelling matches. Eventually, Frigga struck Muspell with a particularly strong verbal volley. Surtr was not dead, she claimed. He had been imprisoned as a traitor for abandoning his post and lay crippled in the burrow’s dungeons. She called him an idiot for his ignorance. Muspell screamed with the rage of his father and beat Frigga to unconsciousness with a stone pot. He flew to the dungeons, where he found Surtr, missing an arm and leg and pockmarked with burn scars. Muspell dared not interrupt his father’s labored snores, and forthwith journeyed to the prime material plane, cursing his land and its people and swearing never to return."3/24/2018 19:41:43,Alistair,Human,Warlock,"Alistair remembers nothing before his arrival in the cursed city of Yharnam. A young chondathan man in a city of xenophobes, he was given shelter by the Healing Church, a local institution which specialized in transfusions of extraordinary blood. His appellation came from the poor clothing in which he was found, and stuck. Yharnam is a curious city; shrouded in eternal darkness, the moon stands still, always staring from behind the gothic steeples that make up its skyline. Blood has a special place in Yharnam - transfusions are commonplace and a bigger source of intoxication than alcohol.In exchange for labor in the church’s weird gardens, Alistair was given food enough to live and blood enough to survive that life. None but the occasional nun spoke to him, and the church’s order of beast hunters ignored his very existence. The church was secretive enough never to allow him into its upper levels, but he sensed something mystical was at work behind its closed doors. A citywide plague known as Ashen Blood struck, leaving even the church crippled. As the city scrambled to find a cure, a now grown Alistair ventured into the forbidden areas through a broken window. There he found something quite surprising: an orphaned Great One, an infant eldritch power.The very sight of the being was shock enough that his hair fell from his scalp. He stared, perhaps for moments, perhaps for eons into the star-like eyes within the creature’s gaping, tentacled maw. He saw his life laid before him, every instant foreordained. Knowing how his life would end, he began to laugh, for it was suddenly hilarious to him. Life was a joke. He blinked and the vision ended. Like a dream, it faded from his mind too quickly to remember, all but one detail. He would serve Ebrietas’s inscrutable will; he would be her tool until such time as he earned his freedom... and transformation: the body of a spider and a brain lined with eyes.With an inhuman sucking sound and a flap of her her glowing, sinuous wings, Ebrietas, Daughter of the Cosmos bade him leave Yharnam to gather the weaponry necessary for her escape. For indeed, Ebrietas was not truly a prisoner of the church, she confided to his barely comprehending mind, but to another Great Old One. All Yharnam was. Caught in a dream ever-repeating yet never quite the same, dawn would only come to Yharnam if this yet unknown god could be slain, and only then could she be free.Forever changed by this encounter, Alistair started on his way. He was, however and perhaps for the first time, truly happy. No more tending the Lumenflower Garden. No more half-rotted bread and peasant blood. Only his own will and that of Ebrietas! Walking through the grey mists beyond the city, time again escaped him. His pilgrimage took years, though how many, none could say. Neither hunger nor thirst found him until he saw the sun on the horizon. He’d finally made it to Altain.To make ends meet while searching for leads for his quest, he took to swindling and murder. A favored tactic of his is to share the location of a “treasure” only to trap and rob those who would steal it. He loves to lie and will nearly always choose a lie over truth if it makes things more interesting. He is a bit clumsy and very much a coward, usually running from a fight he cannot win. He sees most people as pawns in the great game the Old Ones play.Alistair’s treachery knows some exceptions. He is, once one gets beyond his facade, a true and loyal friend. When swept up in the moment, he is even capable of true heroism and bravery though he’s usually quick to dismiss such behavior as a foolish lapse in judgment."3/24/2018 19:46:12,Thalaxandre Kannendry,human,warlock,"Became an evil warlock after his husband and dog were murdered by a marauding band of adventurers in a situation that turned out to be a misunderstanding.

Marian’s mother, Celine, worked in the kitchens of House Witwood and his father, Feldran, was a local tailor. As a child Marian lived an easy enough life, with the Witwoods providing an education well above that someone of his status would normally receive, while his parents taught him their trades. Marian also loved the theatre, and every month when The Wandering Whale troupe came into town he would buy tickets, watch joyously, and badger the actors for the rest of the day. He was almost obsessive, and spent all his spare money buying new scripts, novels, and books about the wonders of the world.Leaving HomeAt around the age of 15 Marian began to feel discontented with his life. While his life in Emon was pleasant, Marian found the familiarity of the city increasingly dull. The tales he had heard of the world beyond thrilled him, but the refuge of fiction started to feel too shallow. Around the same time the Witwoods’ generosity was growing ever more limited, as many in the house began to see the now-teenage boy as a freeloader, not family.And so when The Wandering Whale came into town next Marian hopped on board, trading his services as a tailor for a small bed onboard their caravan. For the next few years Marian and Ruvin travelled with the troupe. Over time Marian began to take on greater roles in the shows, quickly becoming a regular feature of the troupe’s shows. It was a good time in his life, even with the chaos in the wider world, but once again Marian started to feel like there should be something more to his life. And so, caught up in dreams of greatness, he made a terrible mistake.The FeywildIt began, as so many dreadful things do, with wondrous dreams. Marian dreamt of a land of dream, where he was no longer bound with the ties of possibility. A place of colour and emotion that set his mind aflame with inspiration. Since then he has never been sure if she brought the dreams or if the dreams attracted her, he had always quietly hoped the latter.She called herself Amhuir Glamhain, later Marian learned that was actually a Sylvan title: The Lady of Glory. It took some time for him to realise that she was more than simply another dream, but slowly she grew more vital, more assertive, until eventually he could not deny her reality. She made him an offer: come out to the woods at midnight and she would grant him the inspiration he so desired. Marian went, of course, and she delivered on her promise dutifully.Marian remembers little of his time in her domain clearly. Perhaps he engaged in actions of enormity, perhaps he was comatose in a field somewhere. Lucid moments were few and far between, and Marian could count on one hand the number of days he is confident are completely real. Some days it was the vilest tortures, some days halcyon dreams, others grand quests. Dim memories tell of whole lifetimes he experienced, now only a vague recollection, or maybe all he ever had was that vague recollection, left to mock him with what he could never know. ReturningBut eventually, after what felt like both a moment and a millennium, it was over. Marian awoke on a cold hillside, jutting up from a fetid swamp. He was weak, exhausted, and still far from convinced that it was real. So he did nothing. For the rest of the night he just lay there, waiting for whatever vision this was to end, passing in and out of fevered consciousness. When he was found he was barely alive, laying in the grey light of dawn. He was taken in by a woman by the name of Eliza Vance, an elderly fisherwoman who had found him on a walk through the swamps. It took Marian a week to even remember his name from the tangle of lives he’d lived. For months Eliza housed and fed Marian as he recovered, both physically and mentally. It was during these months that he wrote his first full play: Fractures.The Grand PerformanceWith the play completed then came the true difficulty, which was managing to organise a performance as a penniless nobody - particularly one who’d been missing for several years. At first Marian did the obvious, and went around to the theatre troupes of the city, trying to find anyone willing to put on the performance, but without any money to offer such an experimental play was considered too risky. So Marian had to take matters into his own hands. To add to his challenges, soon enough his poverty wasn’t the only obstacle - a high-ranking local cleric of The Lawbearer, Talia Rayne, had heard tell of Marian’s play and become determined that it should not be performed. While exploring some more illicit means of funding for his play, Marian met Mijira Norixius, a woman of remarkable cunning.Together the pair worked for three months, raising money, putting together a troupe, and evading Talia’s efforts to shut them down. It was probably the busiest time of Marian’s life, juggling (not always strictly legal) funding exercises, dodging the increasing roster of people less than pleased with him, and rehearsing for the play itself. Eventually however, it was done. The first performance of Fractures was not exactly met with riotous popularity. It was received well enough, but it was rather too bizarre to be exactly an instant hit. In short time however, it did becomes something of a cultural fad amongst the wealthy, word having been spread by some visiting merchants who had seen the first performance. And so Marian Cullyster was, however briefly, catapulted to a state of near-celebrity. The Current TimeWhatever fame he had soon faded, and after a highly profitable initial tour of Fractures his stardom faded to more a topic of trivia than conversation. It was, however, enough to set him up to continue to travel the country, writing and performing plays in towns and cities across the land. For the next few years his life saw little variation, continuing the same life of a roaming thespian, until his most recent show at last brought him back to Stilben. This, he thought, was a great chance to meet back up with his old friends Ruvin and Mijira, and if they could be roped into performing, well all the better."3/25/2018 8:51:25,Chumbar,Elf,Divine Soul Sorcerer,Sage3/25/2018 8:52:11,Kythor,Tiefling,Ranger,Sage3/25/2018 8:52:37,Balama,Gnome,Bard,Entertainer3/25/2018 9:49:33,Eusebio,Dwarf,Fighter,"Repentant soldier turned goat farmer.

Morag never let her feel awkward or as if she didn’t quite fit in, and Briar grew up learning to ignore and laugh off any attempts at shaming her heritage.Briar’s earliest memories are of Morag – Morag cooking, Morag preparing tinctures and ointments, Morag teaching Briar about the world around them and which parts of plants and animals can be harvested to create healing agents. Morag nurtured Briar’s love of cooking and herbalism, hoping to set her on a path of independence and self-sufficiency.When Briar was 5, she found the fiddle secreted away under Morag’s bed. Morag found her plucking the strings, enraptured by the sounds that she was producing with the instrument. From that point onward, Briar was rarely far from the fiddle, teaching herself what she could, seeking out musicians when they visited the town to learn what she could.At the age of 11, Briar met Thia, another half-elf who was in the service of the local blacksmith. Almost without realising it or knowing how it happened, Thia became another member of Morag and Briar’s family. Despite their many differences, Thia and Briar balanced each other out in ways they didn’t always recognise.As Morag grew older and began to slow down, Briar went to work in the local tavern as a waitress. She would pester the tavern owner to let her show off her cooking skills in the kitchen regularly, but her real dream was to get on the small stage to play the fiddle and sing for the crowd. Most of the town had heard her playing and singing at one time or another, but being on the stage was something different. It was almost a need for Briar.And then…everything changed. In one night, Thia made a decision that meant she had to flee the town, and Morag succumbed to her illness. With nothing left for her there, Briar gathered what was most important to her – Morag’s iron skillet and her fiddle – and fled the town with Thia to start a new life."3/25/2018 15:28:54,Nightshade,Dark Elf,Assassin,"Fell in love with a light elf.

They gave him a dark blade (which the twisted cultists had stolen from an altar to Shar) and watched as their devious plan unfolded. The harpy rose up to attack Eltar but not quick enough, he thrust the blade into the monster's chest ... but as his blade sank into it's flesh, the harpy's shriek turned into his baby sister's (tweak) dying moans.The image shattered as he broke free of the dark illusion but it was too late. He could hear the chanting of the cultists now - Bhaal! Bhaal! Bhaal... then silence fell as they realised that something unexpected was happening. A dark rift, a knife wound in the fabric of the material plane, appeared behind his sister ... mist-like shadows began pulling her silently into the rift. He stood immobile - heart hammering in his ears. A satisfied, death-like sigh drifted from the rift and then she was gone. A second passed before a dark, shadow-like humanoid crept from the rift and crawled towards Eltar - a jagged grin appearing on its face. It came to eye level with Eltar, staring him in the eye before drifting onto the blade, allowing Eltar to stab its chest - and as he did, the creature began to flow into the sword until it was no more. Eltar looked ahead, the darkness drifting from his eyes, upon the lifeless form of his sister. The rift no longer behind her - only the cool evening air and deafening silence. A few days later at his sister's funeral, his mother presented him with a travel pack, warning him that the Clan believe him mad, guilty of purposefully killing his sister. They had found no cultists and intended to have him brought to justice. With his final words to her, he told her that he would grant justice to the true murderer's of his sister, and to all who would incriminate the innocent - no mercy, no cruelty, only justice. He had found it impossible to rid himself of the sword, it had become addictive to him, something of alluring power that he knew he could use in his mission. After a month on the road out of Tymanther, the sword  first spoke to him. It promised the power to enact vengeance, and told him it's name ...

I am a Forest Gnome from Baldur’s Gate. My parents wouldn’t speak much about where they came from and any time that I asked they shied away from the question and told me that their village didn’t exist anymore. From the time I was young I was always fascinated with any book I could put my hands on. I knew that we didn’t have money for me to go to a mages school, so I went into the “family business” and by that I mean I worked at one of the counting houses until I helped my bosses out of a legal dispute over a silly matter involving some elves and a currency that they claimed didn’t exist anymore. I had been reading the accounting tomes for fun and realized I could help out the company. The company was called “Small Change” a counting house ran mostly by dwarves and gnomes. We weren’t well known, but boy were we reliable. My boss Torven decided that since I helped them out of that jam, they would pay for me to become the legal advocate for the company, I was moving up in the world. As I was learning the ropes at the legal college I met the love of my life. Gorgeous gnome and heck of a gal, Eilissa. In one of the first meetings of our cohort I could not take my eyes off of her. Those swirling blue globes sparkling in any light. After a few years of learning we graduated and soon after I took her as my wife. Her parents were already gone at that time, but my family at the counting house paid for our modest ceremony. Life was good. I was working as a representative for “Small Change” and working towards buying a small house on the edge of the city for us. We were happy and nothing in the world could bring us down. For 20 years we thrived as a couple and finally we were hoping to soon have children. During this time I became a teacher at the school that we both went to years ago. I was one of the best and brightest due to my voracious appetite for books of any and every kind. I started really making good money and Eilissa was so proud. Early in the year 1490 Eilissa started having a deep cough that sounded quite unnatural. We thought it was just some easy malady, something easy to be fixed. We went to the apothecary to find a remedy, and the potions stopped the coughing for a while. Soon the coughing came back and there was nothing the local apothecary could do to help my dear wife. (She had a very high resistance to magical potions and healing you see.) She started coughing up blood in the summer of 1491 around Kythorn. So late in 1491 after trying any remedy available to us, I started roaming the world with my wife. I quit my job and decided that I needed to care for my wife. I took her all over the sword coast, to witches, shamans, wizards, clerics, but none could break this sickness. Finally in early 1492 I was out of money and out of options.My wife’s condition was worsening and there was nothing I could do. I went back to work part time and started saving up for a possible resurrection spell, something I did not want to think about, but something that was very possibly necessary in the future. My wife died on the morning of the Autumn Equinox on the 21st of Eleint. I was in mourning for a week. I could not bear to leave my bed save to relieve myself and to drink. I heard a rumor that resurrection spells were not working and there were problems with bringing people back from the dead. There was a wizard that claimed that he could still perform the spell, but I would have to pay up front. To pay for the procedure I had to use the last of my savings and sell our beautiful little home, but I would do anything to bring my dear Eilissa back to me.I have nothing. My wife is dead and I was conned out of all of my earthly possessions save a few gold, my pack of books, and my pack. I decided that I was going to learn the arcane, I was going to bring my wife back if it kills me. I keep a locket of her hair in a glass bauble around my neck on a thin golden chain. I will fix this and I will bring resurrection back. I started researching this curse and all research leads to Chult. There was an adventuring group going to Chult seemingly to find the source of this curse maybe I can find them and join them in their journey.

Rather than be abandoned and loathed, he was raised by a loving grandmother and aunts, and when they passed away his cousins took over.  As far as Locke was taught, his mother was a hero to be honored and revered, while his father was rarely mentioned.  However, his slow aging resulted in bullying and eventually ending up with a group of relatives who only barely remembered how he was related.  While they didn't reject his presence, he clearly made them uncomfortable.

On top of his near-total lack of ambition, Rollo is oftentimes vacant and kind of flaky, which is reflected in his religion: he worships Ao, a God who has never been seen or heard from, and who has never interacted with anything in the universe (to anyone's knowledge). Since there is practically no canonical text to worship Ao by, Rollo has used his faith to spin together various improvised bits of New Age-ish philosophy, all of which seem only superficially profound. If he had to be pinned down on a goal in life, he would volunteer it's ""going with the flow"" or ""being in and around"".Despite this (or perhaps because of it), he is an extremely friendly, helpful, and outgoing dragonborn, and thus the members of the caravan in general think well of him. Well to a certain point, perhaps, but well. And not too many members of the caravan say much about his odd faith because it *does* seem to work, after all -- Rollo has shown himself to be unusually talented at healing other people's ills. Never mind that he claims it's because he's been ""touched by life"".Rollo is a strict vegetarian, and his favorite foods are blueberries and mushrooms. (More the latter than the former.) He also has a great fondness for unusual and exotic incenses, and deliberately goes out of his way to sample some whenever possible.When pressed into combat, he is unexpectedly effective, since strength comes naturally to him, but he maintains his off-kilter view of the world even in battle: he wields two maces, one with a giant peace symbol painted on its head, and the other mace's head is painted with a giant yellow symbol of a smiling face.

It was through this connection that Varis learned to appreciate the knowledge that his father had access to, but yet he never fully committed to. At a young age, around his 40th year, his father was handling some blighted scrolls recovered from the catacombs of Shahabel, a fallen elven stronghold. His father soon fell ill, hallucinating with visions of his dead wife, and died after a painful week of festering sores.Seeing this drove Varis into a dark depression, unusually deep for most elves even after a loss so dear. He became consumed by the loss and sought answers to his father's death in the library's tomes. Four years after starting his search Varis found the answer to his father's death in an unremarkable book, titled The Curious Fungus of Iylelea. It had taken time, but never again would he let someone he loved die from a careless lack of knowledge. The answers to everything were in the parchments, and he would make sure to read everything he could.Following in his father's footsteps he became an under-scribe in the regional library of Aratheas. His fervor for knowledge helped him to comprehend books that elves double his aged had hardly heard of. By the time he was 75 he was promoted to scribe and then over-scribe by 100. Varis was destined to be a scholar, cloistered in dusty rooms over obscure, crusty scrolls his whole life, but events in his 103rd year would change his life forever.The orcs led by war chieftain Shulhug were rumored to be roaming outside there ancestral lands, but no one imagined that they could move so far, so quickly. Varis was in his study when the first screams in the city were heard. He grabbed as many scrolls and parchments as he could and loaded them into a wagon. He didn't stop to inquire about the other scribes, he only cared and was consumed with the preservation of knowledge. Knowledge would outlive them all anyway, just as it outlived his father. As Varis passed the ridge on the edge of Aratheas he looked back to see the city smoking, and the famed library, his home for over 50 years licked by flames.The screams faded into the distance as Varis drove further into the heart of elven territory. When he reached the next city it became clear he was the only survivor of Arathea. Well, him and his two dozen books. He looked at his cart, a measly scrap of what glories were now lost in the dust. He thought of his fellow scribes, abandoned by their friend and left to be flayed by the orcs. The shock of the situation had worn off and now he saw his actions in full day and was filled with the same sadness that he felt after his father's death. He sank to his knees and wept. When Varis looked up he saw the unsleeping eye of Helm on sign above a door. He walked towards the chapel as in a trance. Inside was a cleric of Helm, who offered absolution to Varis in exchange for a lifetime of service--a deal accepted readily in the moment, though questioned many times since. Varis became a cleric of Helm that day. With his vast knowledge he rose through the ranks to become second in command of the regional Helm order. He now is zealous to become first in command, which can only happen if he has exploits to boast about. Exploits in which it is clear that Helm protected him and is with him. Varis has put his scholarly pursuits on hold for the last 20 years as he tries to fight for glory and honor, in the hopes of one day reigning supreme in his order."3/25/2018 20:17:49,Maris Redcrown,half-elf,druid,3/25/2018 21:18:38,Dougal MacGregor,Human,Barbarian,"Hailing from clan MacGregor, young Dougal proved to be a particularly brash and outspoken young lad.

However, the father's words held true, evil must be atoned for, and there is much evil within the masses.  A simple word or two was all it took to turn brother on brother.

His deformities caused the other children to ostracize him, and this extended to his family. After enough bullying, Kai retaliated and killed another child. He was exiled for it, and Soren was left even more lonely, with the hatred of Kai leaking over to his broody younger brother. Soren spent his free time in a nearby forest, just enjoying nature, and trying to befriend some of the animals. At the age of ten, he fell asleep in a tree one day, dreaming of flames emanating from his body, and when he woke up the forest was aflame all around him, with handprints scorched into the wood where his hands were, but he was unburnt; fire danced in his blood, and he felt new channels of a mysterious force opening in his body. Soren had become a monster of some kind. He managed to escape the flames, but had no way to fight the fire, so he ran. His hometown was a logging village, and he had inadvertently ruined a good portion of their livelihood for the season. Knowing that the villagers would not believe that the outcast would not have done this purposely, Soren decided that he would run, and let everyone believe he had died in the blaze. He ran, and made it to the nearest city, where he learned to live on the streets. He found ways to use his new tricks to his advantage, panhandling and performing small tricks for change, stealing when necessary. When he was 17, Soren was finally caught and arrested. Rather than lose his hands, he opted to join the local military for service to work off his debt to society.

Fronan peered around the thick boar skin that served as a barrier between his room and the house’s central common area.“Since the sight of his own blood rendered him weak as the people from which he came.” Rendar crossed his arms over a chest covered with grey hair. “I know you love the boy; I do as well, and you cannot gainsay me. Do not forget who it was that convinced the tribe to keep him.”“Then why?” Varelen hissed in a harsh whisper. “Why send him away if you love him so much?” The Barbarian woman took a slow, deep breath to calm herself before continuing. “Rendar, I will forever be grateful to you. You convinced the Council to allow me to keep Fronan. You fought with me to allow him to train with the other children. But if you insist on this nonsense of sending him away, by Crom, I will show you just how strong a Barbarian maiden can be.”Rendar sighed and inclined his head. “As you wish, but if he fails to bond, I am not sure I can keep the Council from doing forcibly what I am suggesting he do on his own. If Durnjak wins the High Seat, there is nothing I can do to keep Fronan safe.” The seasoned Barbarian warrior ducked under the tent flap and was gone.Now, several months later, Fronan wished his mother had listened, wished he himself had stood up and made his own decision. But he had not, and both Rendar and his mother hunted with the ancestors, struck down by Durnjak when they fought the Council’s decision.Fronan peaked into a belt pouch to check on Jonathan. He slept. Though weak and fragile, Fronan loved this strange creature, the only one he had ever been able to bond. Perhaps, somehow, with training, magic, or the luck of the gods, Jonathan would grow strong. The small ship creaked around him, and Fronan tried to sleep. This new group of companions could be just what he needed to help him fulfill the wishes of Rendar and his mother. Perhaps, with their support, he would defeat the man (not necessarily human) with three eyes, murderer of his first, halfling family, and overcome the weakness that had kept Fronan from protecting his second, human family.Fronan laid his head back against his pillow, dreaming of a mighty Jonathan at his side and the look of fear on Durnjak’s ugly face as Fronan returned to crush his enemies, see them driven before him, and hear the lamentations of their women."3/26/2018 0:12:33,Alton Underbough,Halfling,Necromancer,"Alton was a happy man, a successful performer who settled down on the outskirts of his local village with his wife and had a son. One day, he went into the village, and, when he returned, a barbarian had burned his house down with his wife and child inside. He found their skeletons, his wife's ribbone cracked from the attack and blackened with soot. He fashioned a bone flute out of his son's bones and vowed to try and find vengeance on the one who did this. Alton wandered for around 20 years, before running into the Drow Arch Necromancer Cal, who took him in and taught him his ways for 15 years with the promise that Alton could resurrect his loved ones. Cal later threw him out, telling him that he could never be a necromancer. 5 years later, Alton had managed to awaken his latent magical abilities and met up with an adventuring party, who were soon employed by the Stolzkernian royal family to seek a magical amulet which would cure their lands of a 40 year sickness. As they travelled, and his companions discovered what magic he practiced, Alton grew seperate from the group. Eventually, when in an ancient city under the desert sea, Alton discovered a portal to the underdark which, he hypothesized, would give him the material component for the resurrection spell he sought. In order to attain this component, a black diamond, Alton sacrificed his right forearm and a curse was placed on him, with a black corruption slowly consuming him from his stump up. After freeing a Monastary from an invading force, Alton killed two beasts, and for the first time, held onto their souls as the passed through him on their way to the afterlife.

Patches of her body here and there show leathery red skin where she's missing clusters of scales and from the flat top of her head a crop of small horns protrude haphazardly in different directions.  She picks up two little pots with 'drakeroot' and 'moon-pepper' scrawled on them in blue cave-ooze ink, sniffs one then the other, goes to place one back on the shelf, pauses... and then changes her mind again.  Just then, the voice of Cram, the Bonesnapper clan's chief comes screeching from outside the kitchen.  ""Kip!  Hurry the skeg up with the food, we need to go out scavenging!""""Sorry, sorry!""Her ears flatten and she scurries over to a large, simmering pot and quickly but carefully measures out a pinch of moon-pepper which she sprinkles into the pot.  She holds her paws up to the warmth of the fire below, closes her eyes in concentration and traces a circle in the air with a claw.  After a moment the fire roars and the flames pick up, causing Kip to smile as the pot boils and bubbles enthusiastically.  Just then, Cram jerks his head through the kitchen door.  ""Come on you little scrotling!  I've told you about pratting around with the food!  Just BOIL THE SLUGS!""Kip ducks behind the counter and peeks between a sack of dried crickets and a pile of tattered books.  She stammers ""y-yes chief, I'm sorry!""Cram snarls and yanks his head back into the corridor, nearly knocking over a young boy as he storms off.  The bright-scaled kobold boy rolls his eyes at Clam then strolls cheerfully into the kitchen. Kip's ears twitch happily as she recognises her brother.  ""Hi Bunt, I've got something new for you to try, I hope it's ok"".Bunt's eyes light up and he licks his fangs. ""Smells great.  Don't worry about Cram, he's nervous because the big boss lady is making some kind of deal with a visitor right now""Kip slops a steaming spoonful of the slug stew into a bowl and piles some sad-looking, wilted leaves on top.  ""A visitor?  I wonder if that's the person she's been getting letters from.  She normally gets me to read all her letters aloud to her and then dictates a reply for me to write back but for some reason she wouldn't let me near these ones.  I suppose that's ok though, dragons do like to have privacy.""Bunt reaches for the bowl but stops as Kip sheepishly gestures for him to wait.  He scritches thoughtfully at one of his shiny black horns.  ""Well I wonder if she'll let this visitor leave without setting them on fire or eating them this time.""Kip covers the top of the bowl with both paws and closes her eyes again.  When she removes her paws and wafts away the steam, the previously sloppy lumps floating in the stew are crisp and brown and the leaves are a luscious green, curled into small canoe shapes that float on the surface.  ""Ok it's ready.""Suddenly, a voice booms from beneath the caverns.  Much, much deeper than Cram's... Less of a screech and more of a firm, confident rumble.  Nevertheless, Kip instinctively cowers behind the counter top again.""KIP BONESNAPPER!!""Bunt puts a gentle, well-kept set of claws on her back.  ""You better go, seems the boss lady wants you.  This looks delicious though, thanks Kip.""When Kip enters the chamber, the familiar but always majestic sight of Ysnoth greets her but this time the dragon's normally disinterested scowl is fixed intently on Kip, eyes narrowed.  Next to Ysnoth, dwarfed by her impressive size stands an unfamiliar figure.  A sharply-dressed dragonborn with a green-eyed doberman standing to attention at their side.Though the dragon's voice resonates deep within Kip's gut, Ysnoth speaks gently and deliberately like a cautious diplomat.  ""Kip, my faithful servant.  I have come to an agreement with this... person.  You and your brother are, as I'm sure you know... a little different to the rest of your clan and you will be leaving very shortly to be tutored by this person's associates to achieve your full potential.

Erastil??Erastil holy symbolWhat? Why?HOW???Ooh, well, it would start - I believe - with the tales I'm not supposed to have heard about my mother, and I have been hearing them from a somewhat young age, thanks to my nanny, Pefantica... how she loved to gossip!I'm told - and told by those who should know - that I take after my mother to a quite alarming degree, and that the fervent hope of my extended family is that in a few centuries I'll settle down and study the tomes of arcane & divine lore and become a mystic theurge just as my parents have.Until then, though, I'm still a youth - though not by any accounting a maiden! - I'm unattached, unbound, unpromised and now I am out experiencing the world, though experiencing it a lot more first hand than my father or brother would ever had permitted, had they known of my plans!I have mother to thank for the fact that they don't... I still can't believe that she hid my pregnancy so well, she's truly amazing. And... now I think about it... I am aware of a few year long absences of my mother that I know about, and ... there are many more, now that I have made some discreet enquiries.Gosh. My mind is quite boggled. . .Wow, mother dearest... that's a lot of ploughing that has happened in your field! How many half siblings am I likely to meet on my travels and travails? I think I am sure of at least four... and maybe several more!Nevertheless, with her example to lead me, I'm far more certain, now, that I'm on the right path!And that path is helping those of less fortunate birth than I, which is why I'm a paladin of Elastril.Living in Brevoy for several decades convinced me of the true nature of my desires to serve the greater good by living as an example of what should be, rather than what is. What should be is freedom to live a natural and wholesome life that doesn't ask for more than you can give, and where you don't take more than you need. Less procedural, more pragmatic. Tolerant and accepting of change, rather than rigid and unalterable.You share as needed, charity is rewarded and encouraged. Mutual obligations, rights and respect are what bind a society together.That's why I eloped with the human merchants and, kind of, how I became pregnant with Erianis half a century or so ago. My they were good carefree times... Oh that party... it only lasted a week but gave me a lovely child who will last, well, her lifetime if not mine...  if only I knew which one of the merchants was her father... oh well, it's not really that important, what matters is that she's here now, enjoying life thanks to their and my momentary though many moments of passion! Besides, they're all long dead by now, poor short lived humans.Pregnancy. It's quite a sensitive subject amongst elven society, a half elf child - any pregnancy is a sensitive topic, really - not that children out of wedlock - or species - are illegal or even immoral, just frowned upon ny elves of my families acquaintance. So Eriana is an unacknowledged child of mine, as to not bring shame upon the noble elven name of n'denGina... long may they flourish. It's likely the God's wish that elven women are far more fruitful with non-elves than elves, who knows? As yet, not I. Hmm, I might make some enquiries about that. Or... not.Where was I? Oh yes, I'm a paladin, lawful as well as good. And a paladin of a God recognised as human. And... I'm elven, not human! And a woman, presumed maidenly. It's... it's like the shorter lived races don't even begin to realise that an elf feels everything they do, but for centuries, not mere decades.Erastil taught me pragmatism, not poetry. Accomplishments not artistry.  And survival not sophistry...He taught me things that matter here and now, to enable survival in the here and now. No elegant semantics about Natures balance, the wheel of time, eugenics, and the guidance planning of the 'lesser' races. Just simple, basic and common sense guidance and knowledge about how to survive, how to build and how to prosper.That's what I want.Prosperity.Prosperity for that which I consider under my guidance.I shall bring these lands under my, our, loose guidance to bring to them the prosperity that they can offer. I'll guide the farmers to farm the fertile lands, the woodsmen to crop the forests, and give the townsfolk the wisdom to plan ahead, to store water and food gathered in the good times and to keep some in reserve for when times - inevitably until paradise arrives - get tough.I'll help make laws to bring profit, honour and respect to the travelers who trade goods between outposts, to the farmers and artisans who create those goods, and to the merchants who gather, collect and organise the transfer of commodities between each layer of the nation, slowly binding the land into a bond of mutual and bountiful trade that brings benefits to all who live in the Duchy of Novus Kyonin!By my honour:Imogene nden'Gina, known to some as Imogene Bright WaterPaladin of Erastil.Duchess of Novus Kynonin.-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-Imogene Brightwater's family:Illegitimate child: Erianis Heartgazer, half elf, female, 55 years old, whose Human father died 50 years ago, father is unknown to child and even I don't know his name or lineage (it was a GREAT party and a really awesome week, though, wow....!)Imogene's father, Inneash Darkspear, doesn't know of this child (or the long dead human father/s) nor does my brother, Tanae Bloodseeker.

He and his father were ostracized from other Aarakocra and lived alone on the outskirts of their rural village. Aki's father suffered from visions of threatening spirits, and often fell into fits of hallucination and fearful screams in public. However, his father wasn't the only threat to the peace. An evil organization of monks, the Monks of the Long Death, made their home not far from the sanctity of Akacheta's village. Seeing Aki cast out from the population made him their next project. The monks' leader, a nameless, ancient Kenku man, approached young Aki during one of the many instances he was entirely alone. The old man put a mangled wing around the small bird's shoulders and croaked a string of horrible words into his ear. From that moment on, Aki was never the same. He became even more finicky than before. He was paranoid that he was being watched. But he wasn't able to remember the Kenku man or what he said, or even what he was really afraid of. The rest of the Aarakocra just saw it as Aki following in his old man's footsteps. Eventually, Aki's father's condition deteriorated, and on his deathbed he made Akacheta promise to never become like him and to never be so afraid that he cannot live. At the time of his father's death, Aki was nearing adulthood. It was at this time that the Kenku monk decided it would be best to take Aki under his wing, so to speak. When approached, Ali was neither afraid or at all unhappy to see the man. He only felt compelled to comply with his wishes. After years of training by the Long Death monks, and after his mind became clearer and sharper, the monks' hold on Aki was deteriorating. He became aware of what was truly happening in that awful place. The monks weren't just a group of creepy self-proclaimed outcasts, they were all devoted to the same goal: finding a way to prevent death itself. They studied victims intensely, keeping them teetering on the brink of death in order to observe the process. Aki was naturally horrified by their purpose, and regained full control of his thoughts and actions. He used his newly-sharpened skills to fight his way out of the monks' hideout and never looked back. However, once his mind was no longer clouded, he began noticing a figure almost always at the edge of his vision. He heard whispers when he laid his head down to sleep. He slowly came to the realization that this was his inheritance; the very same visions his father had described. But he refused to become fearful. Instead, he fought his own fear by ridding others of theirs. He became a sort of mercenary, and travelled across the land devoting himself to relieving the world of its evils.

At the same time, word of his precocious martial feat spread, reaching the ears of a small band of mercenary warrior monks called the Hawks. They came and offered to take him and teach him their fighting secrets. At the monastery, Cricket blossomed. He became talkative and friendly, finding in the Hawks a new family, and was known as much for his good humor as his extraordinary talent as a fighter. He was given his name, ""Cricket,"" for his incessant chirping; for his small, dark frame; and for his ability to leap about the practice field. He eagerly helped brew and drink the Hawks' beer, and his accordion was a lively addition to the merry music-making of the elven monks. As he grew, he started going with the Hawks to defend villages of wood elves from bandits, beasts and monsters of the forest, and always-encroaching human woodsmen. He learned quickly, and become a deadly tool against the evils that threaten the elves. And then his life turned upside-down, again. He was sent to bring a message to a village elder in the next valley, but when he returned all the monks were gone from their compound. They vanished, with no signs of where they had gone, or what their fate was. Cricket now wanders the land, looking for any sign of his brothers and sisters.

It depicts a faceless woman with enormous belly and breasts, and is the token of the spirit he has bonded with -- a nameless mystical force of life and fertility. The figurine hangs around his neck. Nameless wandered the wilderness, seeking out the agents of death and corruption and battling them, following the wordless commands -- bolts of inspiration and intuition -- of his Mistress. She gave him a sprite to keep him company during his isolation. He calls it ""Jennifer,"" but he doesn't know why. Perhaps it's related to the reason he kept the scarlet waistcoat he was wearing when he emerged from the cave, carefully protecting it as the other clothes he wore disintegrated under the elements. Nameless wears the waistcoat under the leather armor he crafted from the skin of a possessed and rabid panther he slew. Occasionally, a flash of red can be seen under his black armor. After years, he has emerged from the wilderness, and he doesn't know why. His Mistress will guide him. With his tangled hair entwined by twigs and leaves; wild, filthy beard; rough black panther armor; vacant expression; and long silences interspersed by savage outbursts, Nameless is hopelessly out of place in civilized areas and looks like a dangerous lunatic to most.

I randomly rolled for a backstory, so this may sound absurd.Falkalor was not any ordinary Halfling. He was a bounty hunter, a damn good one at that, he wasn't the same kind of cheery and affable little folk many Humans and others may be accustomed to; Flakalor was raised by dragons. According to the dragons that appointed themselves as his mother and father, his true parents were slaves in a far off Kingdom called Meed. They escaped one night, running as far away from Meed as possible, they hitched rides with Halfling caravans and went to many different kingdoms, preforming and selling wares to the common man. Eventually, Falkalor's birth mother became pregnant with him, the two could not be happier. However not all was good. Not too long after his birth, soldiers from the kingdom of Meed arrived in a town that was in the clutches of the wicked Elvish king, they were there to collect new Halflings as slaves. His parents made a break for it, his father was struck down with a crossbow bolt, and his mother barely made it to a nearby forest. There she hid for what seemed months on end, becoming weaker and weaker due to a terrible illness, she prayed to Desna the goddess of luck, to bring forth someone - anyone to care for her child. A grand roar rolled over the mountains and hills and a massive dragon landed before her, it polymorphed into a Halfling man. He walked over and spoke in the common tongue.""Desna has heard your pleas. Fear not, your child shall be safe within our care.""""I didn't think dragons answered to gods and goddesses...""""Not all, but dragons whose hearts see more than material possessions and destruction are often alligned with the gods, it is... A mutual benefit.""Falkalor's mother hesitated, kissed her baby's forehead and handed hi to the dragon.""Thank you... Praise be to Desna..."" She said as she walked into the woods to die peacefully. Many years passed by and Falkalor was trained by the dragons to speak Draconic and to fight. He became well versed in swordplay and so decided to leave the cave he called home to use his skills for the better of the world. In his adventures he ended up exposing the corrupt Elvish king, this landing a bounty on his head. He remains within the shadows and still hunts if the coin is good enough. He has no alignment to anyone but his family, and if he were to feel they were in jeopardy, he'd kill the client without hesitation.

The merchants and cargo he was transporting was worth a massive amount of gold, and they were concerned with missing a Full Moon Festival to sell their goods. Against the captain's better judgement, he sailed the ship directly into an oncoming storm. It was then a  sea monster ambushed the ship and tore it to pieces. As it began to pick off survivors, a massive thunderbolt came down from the heavens and severely wounded the creature, causing it to retreat without even touching a single sailor on board.Hoi looked up. The clouds were already parting, and yet the thunderbolt had came and saved him regardless. As he swam over and clung to a piece of debris, he swore he saw a shimmering dolphin say, ""you're welcome.""His chance meeting with Father Ripplelake was caused by Hoi going on a drunken stumble through the streets, rambling about how no one would believe that he and his crew were saved by the ""shiny golden talking dolphin.""After sobering up the following morning, he discovered that Deep Sashelas had saved his life, and perhaps even chosen him to be his cleric.Heart accepted, as he felt grateful for the god who saved his life. Father Ripplelake then mentored him, teaching him the Elvish language, martial proficiency, and how to be a divine conduit.Hoi is now a holy man, repaying whom he believed to be Deep Sashelas, the elven god of the sea by serving him.The rest of his faith, and even Father Ripplelake to an extent, sees Heart somewhat suspiciously, and even with contempt at the idea of a human attempting to worship and Elven god, when they and only they have ever truly heeded His teachings. Deep Sashelas does not curry the favour of many followers, the hundred-year-war causing surface dwellers to turn their attentions and prayers inland than beyond the shores.And the followers Deep Sashelas attracts are almost all Elven, or of Elvish descent. The other races tend to far favour the teachings of their own gods.Heart understands the contempt towards him by the fellow members of his faith, but he largely has decided to ignore them, hoping to prove his own merits as a rightful cleric of Deep Sashlelas and spread His teachings by example.He cannot persuade the world by words, and he lacks the force of a paladin. But he can live as a cleric doing good for the Duchy, and he knows that with enough good deeds and glory, he will not need to speak for the world to follow.

She's the sort of friend that would help you burn your own house down.The only thing that's certain about her is that she's a liar.  Ask three of her friends where she was born, and you'd end up with four different answers.  The people closest to her know when she's telling the truth because that's the only time she sounds like she's lying. Take the following with that observation in mind.Myka grew up in a human village with an absent father.  The common folk never really gave any mind to her lineage, but those 'in charge' sure did.  See, they had rules.  Some applied specifically to elves, and Myka have one foot in both worlds, ended up at the mercy of those in power who decided when which rule set applied to her and when it didn't.  She learned early on that laws are just words, and can be used just like any other words, to help or to hurt.  Mostly they're used to hurt; to hurt the common folk, to keep them poor and indebted.There was an orphanage in her town run by a retired ranger of some sort. An older man ill-equipped to tend to children, but still gamely trying.  There was no law that helped him or the kids.  One of her friends lived there, and one day she went with her to visit and play.  It wasn't until she left to go home that she realized that the never *opened* anything.  The entire facility was open to the world. Myka approached the old man and asked why that was, and he said, ""Well, I'm building this place myself.  Walls and a roof are more important than doors.  I've build it so that most of the rooms can stay warm, and the common area can stay cool. Whenever we get the supplies or can afford them, I'm sure we'll get to it.""  Well that was some bullshit, she thought.  Her house had at least THREE doors.  That night, while her mother slept, she disassembled front door to her house, dragged it to the orphanage, and left it leading in the aperture.  It wasn't until she was almost home and saw the empty doorway that she realized just how angry her mother was going to be.  She thought quickly, if her house had had three doors, surely those large fancy houses in those places she wasn't allowed to go - because rules - would have even more to spare.  It was already late, verging on early morning, so she didn't have much time!She snuck out and up over the walls intended to keep people like her out, and discretely tapped at windows until she found one loose enough to open wide enough for a door to be dragged through, and empty enough not to be caught immediately. Fortunately, these homes were way to large for the number of people living in them, so finding an empty room was not much of a challenge.After removing the door, shoving it out the window and back over the wall, damaging but not destroying it on the way, she managed to drag it back to her home and install it.The next morning, she realized what was wrong: the door was way too fancy for her home and stuck out.  Never mind her mother would have - and did - notice immediately.  And despite the space population density in the richer part of town, the residents did in fact notice that an entire door was missing, a window was open, and things were torn up.So she ran.  Grabbed the few things she thought she would need: some clothes, a knife, a sack of food, and she ran.  She lied her way into a caravan, and... well, here we are.

They were sorted in as male where the sexes were separated in school, but that time is long past. Bryn’s name is a child name among the elves. It predates Bryn’s adoption, and was presumably given by their father, about whom Bryn has no other information. This is a large part of why Bryn has not chosen to adopt a human name or an adult elven name, even knowing that their publications in research journals will seem to be written by a child from an elven perspective. Bryn’s research was ostensibly about extraplanar creatures and those touched by extraplanar entities, but they were discovered to be using local myths and cryptid stories as serious academic sources, even if the person giving the tale appeared to be insane.

It is a giant, and it will eat me whole if it catches me.I am surviving.In the dark in the hold of the ship I must be quiet or they will find me. It is not the ship I used to call home, it is large and well provisioned. I do not eat more than I need, do not take anything that might be missed. I breathe with the waves like mother taught me. We have been at sea so long and I do not know where this boat full of strangers is headed but I will not panic. If I only take what I need, if I stay quiet, they will not find me. I am a child and this is my life now.The sun on the island is hot and bright and the sea and sky stretch out forever. The nearest island is a faint spot on the horizon and I do not know its name and couldn’t swim that far if I tried. I am alone and I do not know how to make a boat and there is a turtle in the water as big as a hut, that rests on a sandbar just outside the cove at low tide, and I know it sees me and it knows I see it. It is waiting for me to make a mistake.I am a child and I am hiding in my mother’s trunk and I am very quiet while the man who named me yells at her. I have to stay out of his way. She tells me later that he is a good man and he takes care of us and we would not have food or a place to stay without him but I hate him anyway. He makes her sad and afraid and he named me a bad omen and when the other men come they talk with him and give him coins and I have to hide.His name is Indomitable Typhoon, and I am going to kill him.Ursoni Bright Eyes holds me on her hip. I am young and the world is large and bright and the city streets are crowded with merchants and travelers and so many people rushing from one place to another. Ursoni pretends to cry and tells the strangers that she needs money to feed me and I’m supposed to cry and say that I am very hungry but sometimes I forget and she hits me when we’re away from the crowd. I am always hungry. Ursoni wears a rag over her hair and sometimes I forget I’m not supposed to pull on it and she gets angry with me. There are other beggar children on the street, no matter what street we walk on. The vendors shoo us from their carts, wary of thieves.My hair is turning blue in the sun. So many years hidden away in the holds of ships, only coming out at night to peek above decks or transfer from sea to land or ship to ship, my hair had turned black as pitch. Now I am in the sun every day and it makes my skin brown and my hair blue, and there are no people here, no one but the frogs that chirp “ko-ki” in the night and the turtles that meander through the reef and up the streams and sometimes carry the little frogs on their backs in the tidal pools, and the turtle in the deep that is waiting for me.I am surviving.I am a child in bed with my mother. The sheets are soft and the blankets are heavy, the mattress is worn but comfortable and I sink into it a little. I never want to leave.The door slams open and a man stomps in. He grabs me by the wrist and I cry out in pain and surprise.“Leave her alone!” my mother yells. Indomitable Typhoon yanks me out of the bed and releases my arm, launching me into the wall. Instinctively I duck and lead with my shoulder, bouncing off with only a bump. He glares at me as he takes my place in bed, black eyes tinged with red from too much rum and shouting.I am supposed to leave when a man is in mother’s bed. I never forget this one thing. I skulk out quietly, shutting the door without a creak. I have to go somewhere and hide and be quiet. There is a turtle waiting for me in the water.I imagine myself asking him where my mother is. I could not find her on the ship. I imagine myself tying him to a chair, beating him, making him cry. I imagine letting him see my face, making sure he knows that it’s me as he dies. I imagine a lot of things.The room is dark. He does not know I am here. I will not ruin my chances by giving in to curiosity or spite.The knife feels heavier in my hand than it really is.I hit the water badly. The men who threw me overboard laugh as I bob up to the surface, proud of themselves for finding the stowaway. It is the first time I’ve been caught out. I thought I was quiet enough, careful enough, but now I am in the water and there is an island in the distance and if I do not reach it I will surely drown.I don’t look back at the men again. Getting to shore is the only thing that matters. I am surviving.“I can’t take her any more,” Ursoni Bright Eyes says. “She’s too big now, I don’t make any money with her.”My mother frowns. “The ship is no place for her.”“Then send her to an orphanage, or sell her,” Ursoni insists, shoving me away. I start crying, but she just shakes her head and leaves.“It’s alright, Red Sky,” mother tells me. “We knew she wouldn’t be able to watch you forever. You’ll just have to learn how to get by on the ship.”I nod and rub the tears away with balled up little fists. I am too young for this.At first I think it is a normal turtle nearby, but the water here is so clear it takes a moment to realize it is a giant turtle far away. Far away but getting closer. I swim with all my might towards the island, it is not far away now. Even if the turtle is racing towards me, even if it is a creature of the deep and I am already getting tired. All I can hear is the sound of my arms breaking the surface, my own gasping breaths. I don’t dare to look again below or behind me, it will cost too much time. I can see the shoreline clearly, there are trees and rocks ahead. “She is too young for this!” My mother yells. I am hiding in the trunk and I hope he does not look for me in here because I’ll be cornered.“You spoil her. The girl needs to work,” Indomitable Typhoon says.“Then let her work in the kitchen, or on the decks. She’s good with a mop and she’s a fine eye for a lookout…”“I don’t need a lookout, or a scullery maid! Now you bring her to me or I will have her in shackles on the next ship bound for the Wild!”“I don’t know where she is,” she lies. “You know that girl is always hiding herself away.”“You find her, and you bring her to me,” he growls.I have to keep quiet.My hand hits the sand and I scrabble onto the shore, disoriented and unsteady on my feet. The turtle is behind me, pulling itself up easily on the land and lunging towards me, enormous mouth open wide and full of spikes to pull still-living prey down its gullet forever. I run and shimmy up the nearest tree, turtle snapping behind. It breaks the trunk I am climbing and I have to jump into the branches of the next tree, grasping desperately.The turtle is so large if you made a bed of its shell five grown men could sleep comfortably without touching. Its eyes are like cannonballs, huge and black and impenetrable. Its shell bears scars from things too terrible to imagine, marks from the teeth of sharks and the hooked suckers of giant squid and the beaks of octopuses, and another deep gash that looks like nothing more than an enormous sword wound. It has survived things I cannot imagine. It is still surviving.The hurricane comes and I am not ready for it. How could I be ready for it?  Three seasons on this island and I still don’t know how to start a fire or braid a strong rope or build a boat. There is never enough water, I survive on fish and gulls and jackfruits when the trees deliver them, but the trees know the hurricane season is on us and there are no ripe fruits to steal. The crabs have all left the reef and the fish are cowering, and I have nowhere safe to be.There is a turtle waiting for me in the waterThe wind is too much and I am carried off my feet and far into the sea, the waves choppy and gray under the dark sky. I break the surface badly, plunging into water choked with debris churned up from the depths and washed out from the land. I can’t see.“You have to go away,” my mother says. “You have to leave the ship and never come back, do you understand?”“I can hide,” I say. “He won’t find me.”“You cannot stay. Hide on another ship.”“But mama!”She shushes me. “Do you want him to find you here? Do you want to be taken away to the Wild?”“No, mama.” I don’t want to be crying, I want to be brave.“You must be quiet, you must be careful,” She says. “I have a water skin for you and some clothes in a bag, it won’t be too heavy. Always make sure you carry water with you on a ship. Never drink the sea water.”“Yes, mama.”She opens the porthole and hands me the bag. “Hurry,” she whispers. “Be careful.”I climb out and dive into the water. Even with the bag, I barely make a splash.I am surviving.I throw the turtle a jackfruit. He gulps it down, then butts the tree with his head. I pull another of the yellow-green, bumpy fruits away from the trunk and hurl it down, catching a faint whiff of the syrupy sweetness as he snaps it in half. While he’s busy rooting in the sand for the rest of it, I jump to another tree. He groans, belatedly, and starts shaking the tree I was in just a moment ago. I have to keep moving. It’s hard to keep quiet in the canopy, but I know I’ll be safe if I just keep moving a little longer.I’m all turned around, the hurricane water is all around me and I cannot see the island or the seafloor it’s nothing but gray sky gray waves and I sputter and choke when I mistake one for the other. I try diving down to find the bottom, thinking if I can find the slope I can follow it home. It’s dark down here and I don’t know if the turtle is around but I’ll drown if I stay out too long. Even below the surface the waves are strong, but I can handle this, I can do this, then something too strong comes and I am tumbling my head my head my head I can’tIt is dark as night in the hold of the ship.“I’m scared, mama,” I whine. I clutch at her skirt with my tiny hands in the dark. “I don’t want to stay down here.”“Hush, Red Sky,” she says. “There’s nothing to be afraid of. We’re alone down here, just you and me and the rats, and the rats are so much smaller than a big, strong girl like you.”I don’t feel big and strong. I miss Ursoni and the market.“The dark is nothing to be afraid of,” she says. “You are the scariest thing in this room.”In the dark, I plunge the knife deep in his chest.I wake up on the shore, the storm clouds still overhead but brighter than before. I cough and gag salt water, turning to let it all out, gasping for fresh air. I was in the water… my head… I find the sore spot with my fingers and wince. Must have hit it on the rocks in the cove.Something is breathing on me.I turn and the turtle is there. Its head is so big I could curl up inside, its nostrils flaring wider than my fists.I don’t scream. I have to be quiet.The turtle nudges me with its snout, mouth closed. Why hasn’t it swallowed me whole? Why am I on this beach? My forehead burns, bright golden light blaring out, illuminating the dank little room like midday. Indomitable Typhoon looks at me, horrified, as the glow intensifies, building up in a towering aura behind me. Glittering feathers drift to the floor and fade to nothing, peeling gently away from the wings of a great, golden albatross.“Bad omen,” he laughs. He sputters, and there is no more.I dive in the water, not knowing what to do. The turtle is there waiting for me. I expect him to be afraid, but he swims right up to me and I grab onto the edge of his shell tightly. He still trusts me. We swim for hours into the open water, until my glow begins to fade and the sun begins to peek above the horizon.Stowaway. Murderer. Urchin. Anathema. Red Sky At Morning is right."3/26/2018 15:42:47,Sker Íshvalr,Dwarf,Druid,"(Notes: Both names derived from Old Norse: first name pronounced like the English word “scare,” last name pronounced ees-kvAl-r. Don’t ask me why they pronounce h like k before a v, but they do. Also, ""Martian"" refers to being from our campaign world's sea-faring country of Mars, not the irl planet.)Sker was born the same as all Martians, on a boat. Now I could lie, and wax poetic of how he entered the world in the throes of a raging storm, amongst a tumult of waves and wind that threatened to rip the very clothes from your back, and this was to be an omen for his rancorous disposition and later druidic calling… but the truth is he was born on a clear day in mid-summer, and his early childhood was quite uneventful. No one can say where his surliness came from. To outside observers, he seemed to bear the weight of the world on his shoulders, and the weight of ice in his heart, although anyone who cared enough to see past his exterior quickly realized there was no malice behind his barking. Still, his hard abrasiveness was enough to earn him his True Name.Dwarves of Mars do not name their young at birth, but prefer to wait and watch until a True Name arises that fully encompasses the individual’s core. This first name stays with them always, as a label of sorts, and it is unthinkable to shorten it or alter it in any way. Over time, dwarves may earn additional names commemorating moments of personal growth or achievement. Their full name is their full story. “Sker” is the dwarven word for a small rocky protrusion jutting up out of otherwise calm waters, and that indeed is who he is at heart – a solid, stubborn mass sticking out like a sore thumb amongst his peers; a hardened, inhospitable one-man mountain impeding the natural flow. Yet, though he is a dedicated curmudgeon, he also exudes a sense of unwavering strength and competency, with his words as wise as they are biting, allowing him to act as a firm anchor point for those willing to trust him.(It should be noted that non-dwarves who meet him usually assume his name is a purely physically-descriptive moniker, claiming his dark stocky frame looks uncannily like a rocky outcropping when he is treading water. They are not entirely wrong on that point.)He earned his second name as a wee lad of 26 years. The story goes it was the dead of night in the dead of winter, and he had just stumbled onto the deck of the ship in a drunken haze, carrying two bottles of dwarven ale and singing loudly of the many ways the rest of the crew could bugger off. At the peak of his accompanying gesticulations to this little ditty, he lost his balance and fell right over the side of the ship. Though the sailors on night watch tried desperately to locate him amid the chopping waters, it was as though he had been swallowed whole by the sea.Nine nights later he was found by a passing trade ship, floating unconscious in the ice. When he came to, his skin was completely numb, his head hurt, his joints ached, he had difficulties hearing, and he claimed to have no memory of what had transpired during his time in the sea. The merchants wrote it off as a case of the bends coupled with extreme elemental exposure, and went about trying to track down his kin.Later, back on board his ship, his family noticed he was different, changed beyond just a simple case of decompression sickness. The merchants’ healer had alleviated his physical symptoms, but still the partial hearing loss persisted with no apparent medical or magical cause. He also seemed eerily calmer than normal, quieter, gazing out at the water with a faraway reverence that no one could explain. It was clear he remembered something, but he refused to talk about what happened. Over the course of the next few weeks, rumors abounded on the ship. “He was punished by the gods for his terrible demeanor and even more terrible singing!” some said of his partial deafness. “No,” others joked, “he almost died, but the ocean saved him because he offered it two bottles of our best ale!” Still he kept the truth to himself.Despite his injury and the ordeal he went through, he couldn’t wait to get back into the water; it was almost as if he felt more comfortable there than on the ship. It was only when he started publicly correcting the elders on matters relating to their surroundings, matters he should only have a passing knowledge of (their maps of the region, the local environment and weather patterns, the sea creatures they encountered… ) that they started suspecting what had really happened.Their suspicions were confirmed when, while their ship was under attack by a band of pirates, he unwittingly shot ice from his hands in self-defense.  As the pirates turned tail in fear, it was clear to the wisest of the ship’s leaders that Sker had formed a mystical connection with the frozen ocean, and was able to channel its power and magic to his own ends. They gave him the name “Íshvalr,” meaning “whale of the icy waters” (inspired by that great Jötunn of legend), to mark his new life as a creature permanently tied to the sea and the elements.Since he was still a child by dwarven standards, his parents felt uncomfortable sending him off for training, so they instead invited a respected druid by the name of A_albjörn Sævarr (pronounced ah-thahl-byurn sai-vahr, and meaning “noble bear” “defender of the sea”) to travel with their ship and instruct the boy in the basics.So life continued for a time. Eventually, Sker, a quick study, mastered all there was to be taught, and A_albjörn recommended he seek out further guidance from the Order of Benthos, the largest association of druids in that region of Mars. His parents grudgingly consented, knowing there was nothing more they could do for him, and recognizing that a rookie magic user on board was more of a liability than an asset.Thus it came to pass that Sker saw out the rest of his childhood on an unmarked forested island bordering Althean waters, deepening his bond with the natural world and learning all he could from the small conclave of masters there. During that time he never managed to endear himself to an animal companion, or any animal, really, since they seemed to react to him in much the same way as the people he had known. Instead, he grew to worship the ice-covered ocean, seeing its neutral coldness and harshness, which somehow still managed to support the lives around it, as a reflection of his own temperament.At 40 he was conscripted into five years of naval service, the standard for all who come of age in Mars. He found the strict discipline and chain of command antithetical to his nature, and constantly butted heads with his superiors. At the end of his required tour, he was happy to part ways with the military, and they were happier to see him go.For the past 18 years, he has hopped around from ship to ship as a freelance sailor and cartographer - sometimes on a fishing vessel, sometimes engaging in underwater prospecting or dungeoneering expeditions. He has gained the nickname “The Irascible Old Man,” due to being brusque and hard-of-hearing. Though he is generally seen as unpleasant to work with, he is recommended based solely on his skills and wide range of magical abilities. Also, there may or may not be a running bet at the local portside bar to see how long crews will put up with him.Catchphrase: “I don’t give a goshdarn damn!”"3/26/2018 16:15:50,Jaspermunk Hildybin Bibbertyfimble,Gnome,Swashbuckler,"Jaspermunk Hildybin Bibbertyfimble had always wanted to be a pirate.  The only hitch in this aspiration was the fact that good girls did not run off to become salty sea dogs.  Her parents tried in vain to interest her in the noble arts of illusion and engineering, but Jaspermunk jokingly used what little magic skill she had to thoroughly annoy her siblings instead of taking her studies seriously.  After shaping her dancing lights into a ghostly humanoid to scare and chase around her little sister, using ghost sound to produce phantom pirate catchphrases such as “Arrrrr” and “Aye-aye captain” while her elder sister was trying to read, and making all of her younger brother’s food taste like fish and barnacles with prestidigitation, her family finally gave up on dissuading her.  She longed to leave the cursed Dwarf-occupied town of Bibbertysnoob and set off towards the high seas (maybe even exploring far away continents).  She was tired of listening to Dwarven epics about how each warrior had managed to fell “50...no 100!” Drow each, and she was equally tired of the stench of Dwarven ale that hung about the city like a plague-ridden fog.  As if that wasn't enough of a reason to get the heck out of Dodge, there was also the little “incident” last year when a large chunk of the city was carved away by a burning beam of death, due to the incompetence of Koshka and his band of bungling brethren. And the girl who tagged along with them in their shenanigans managed to get herself eaten by a sea-beastie in the process... not an entirely intelligent course of action. Jaspermunk was sure she could have done a much better job of handling the situation if she had been old enough at the time.  Recently, Japermunk finally got her chance for real adventure.  She was enamored of a group of experienced adventurers that were passing through the town, and resolved that through swash or buckle, she was going with them.  Comprised entirely of humans and elves, the group laughed and patted her on the head when she approached them, mistaking her for a much younger child.  That night she snuck out to their caravan while they were in one of the taverns, and stowed away within the luggage.  Upon awakening, she sheepishly gazed up into the eyes of four very angry humanoids, but decided to stick to her guns and put on a brave face.  She told them that she would become the greatest pirate ever to sail the seas, and that if they let her stay she would fight boldly and not even request a share of the loot.  They looked into the adorably hopeful face before them and sighed.  They explained that they had journeyed to Bibbertysnoob to meet up with a friend of their employer capable of high level magic.  While she had slept in, the entire group and their gear had been teleported to a jungle far from her town, and that at present they did not have the time or money to get her safely back home.  They grudgingly accepted that the only solution was to protect her for the time being, and try to get her home after the mission was completed.   She discovered she had fallen in with a group of treasure hunters retained by a human nobleman to seek out lost magic items and artifacts for his collection.  Their current goal was to find a specific scythe, a relic hidden within the temple of a long-dead religion.  She was to follow alongside the party closely, and learn as much as she could from them to protect herself.  They had no small-sized weapons to loan her, so she was stuck grappling with a too-big rapier.  To their surprise, she got the hang of it relatively quickly, and was soon wielding it with an uncommon grace.  Jaspermunk explained that she was simply destined to be a pirate, and that the art of swordplay ran through her veins instead of blood.  As they hacked and slashed their way through the wall of humidity and vines perforating the jungle air, the group told her stories of the original inhabitants of the temple and their monkey-headed god.   They laughed as Jaspermunk perched on top of a nearby stone performing a close approximation of said deity, puffing her cheeks out and holding her hands out for tribute.  Over the course of the three-day journey to the temple site, their initial anger subsided, as her continual antics had the effect of increasing the groups’ moral.  She also proved rather more capable at combat than they had anticipated, for her agility and speed far outweighed the hindrances of her size and strength.  She helped slay tigers, panthers, reptiles, and other assorted jungle fauna, and managed to dodge out of the way of poisonous gnome-eating plant life.     Jaspermunk was overcome with awe as they finally made it to their destination.  A dilapidated mountain of carved stone towered over the trees, like an ornately crafted caltrop set upon the land by a titan.  They group wended their way through the maze of fallen rocks and statues, and into the main sanctuary of the temple grounds.  Jaspermunk looked up to see a statue more than six times as tall as her, bearing the tell-tale monkey face of the forgotten god.  One of its outstretched arms had broken off and shattered across the floor, and she couldn’t help feeling sorry for him.  At the base of the statue one of her companions released a hidden lever, and the floor slid back to reveal a mold-covered stairwell.  Descending into the darkness, their path was only slightly lit by a growth of bioluminescent lichen along the walls.  They were heading into what appeared to be a maze of catacombs, and the pungent fragrance of the air suggested they were the first living visitors in hundreds of years.  Their goal was rumored to be stored in the back left corner of the dungeon, so they set out in that general direction.  The rogue managed to disarm the “pit of spiky death,” but most unfortunately missed spotting the “trap of acid-spewing death” which hit him full-on in the face.  The party immediately became somber and cold at his loss, yet they knew the dangers of their profession, and resolved to move forward with the mission. Seeing that Jaspermunk was inevitably more nimble of finger than the rest of them, they grudgingly handed her the fallen thief’s tools and had her attempt to fill in as best she could.  The tank took point in an effort to be a fortitude-saving trap-sponge, and Jaspermunk did her best to lock-pick and disarm the few obvious obstacles.  Luckily the grace of her reflexes saved her from her more-than-occasional snafus, and the tank decided it was probably easier to bash through the rotting wooden doors than to rely on her skill.At last they chanced across the room they were searching for, the hidden treasury of artifacts.  The problem arose when they discovered a giant cube of gelatin had taken residence, and was not taking kindly to the notion of leaving.  The tank quickly pulled Jaspermunk behind him as the spellcaster blanketed the ooze with fire and brimstone.  Then, wading through the sticky and partially-digested remains of the once-glorious treasury, they set about looking for the scythe.  Taking smaller treasures for themselves as bonus payment, they finally spotted their quarry hanging on the far wall.  Unfortunately for the group, no one prepared them for what they were about to discover.  Worse than a mantle afraid of the dark, worse than a sphinx with a lisp, worse than a horde of flumphs... the scythe was intelligent.  Not just intelligent, but imbued with the soul of the most sniveling, nagging, curmudgeonly priestess ever to have walked the earth.  (A priestess who just happened to speak a close-enough dialect of common to still be understood)  Every five minutes the scythe would go into a rant about how “This entire group combined does not have half the brains of a plague-rat...  How dare you even presume to set your hands upon me?  My son Un’kbuut would smote you heathens, bless his soul, if he were still alive...”  On and on it went until the group seriously decided leaving the scythe behind at the risk of not getting the nobleman’s reward.  Jaspermunk thought it was no wonder the scythe had been locked away, and seriously doubted she would remain sane for much longer with the ceaseless caterwauling from the enchanted weapon.  The plan was to hike another few days to the coast, where they would meet up with a ship to take them back to the northern continent.  Jaspermunk had never actually seen the ocean or ridden in a ship before, and she was almost bouncing with excitement as they were nearing the end of their trek.  The ranger had brought them out fairly close to the meeting site, and they could see the ship anchored in the distance.  Jaspermunk had to seriously stop herself from running and paddling through the saltwater with glee and hugging the bow of their transport.  She was finally going to be face-to-face with real sea dogs.  As the rest of the group sorted out the financial and practical end of things, mainly finding a chest big enough and dense enough to muffle the noise of the relic, Jaspermunk was given a brief tour of the ship.  Disappointingly, the sailors all spoke normal common instead of her imagined pirate-speak, but she giggled every time she heard words such as “starboard” or “rigging.”  They even laughed and let her climb up into the crow’s nest to get a better view.  They set sail that evening, and at first she was having the time of her life.  She drank grog and learned how to sing shanties, and the sailors had her practice tying knots so that she could help with the rigging the following day.  However, that night as she was sleeping in her hammock a storm hit, and she was not entirely pleased to have the ship swaying all about when she had a perfectly good hangover.  After a few days, though, she got used to the rhythm of the ship, and didn’t even mind eating hard tack, questionable meats, and moldy cheese for almost every meal (although she decided to stick with the rationed water instead of having a repeated run-in with the sailors’ firewater).  She missed bathing, but at least the cold salt air up on deck was fresher than the steaming sweat they had faced in the jungle.  All in all, she was quite content to be living like a real swashbuckler, and was sad to think of having to make port.  She lost count of the days, but eventually they sighted their destination in the distance.  Upon nearing shore, the three remaining party members told her that even though she had come into the party uninvited, she had proven her worth and therefore was entitled to a share of the reward.  They had planned on splitting the pay four ways anyway, and felt she deserved to have the rogue’s share for herself.  Jaspermunk didn’t even know what to say, and the others just accepted her silence as thanks.  Apart from being inside the town mayor’s mansion, Jaspermunk had never been near royalty.  Once they docked, the three companions led her to the estate of their lord, and she was allowed to freshen up from the journey.  She tried to make herself presentable by wearing the only half-decent outfit she had stuffed into her travel bag: a pair of flaming orange pants and her best purple and yellow tunic.  However, once they were in the receiving room, she felt out of place next to the elf in flowing green robes, the human fighter in his hand-polished armor, and the ranger in her simple gown of burgundy.  The nobleman, a baron, took one quizzical look at her, and his fears were confirmed by the curt nods of the others.  The told him the full story of her addition to the party, of the rogue’s untimely passing, and of her contributions in his stead.  Instead of giving her a share of the money, he gifted her with a mithril shirt.  Then he proceeded to lecture the group on leaving their luggage unattended, and on taking a child on such a dangerous journey, even if she proved capable.  He also gave Jaspermunk a full rant about worrying her parents sick and wandering off with strangers recklessly, although she caught a twinkle in his eye which hinted that he would have done the same thing at his age.  He was delighted with the scythe, and seemed fascinated in talking to it, much to the horror of the party.  That evening he threw a grand feast in celebration, but warned Jaspermunk that she was to be sent home via carriage the next morning.  Her parents had already received a sending spell informing them she was currently safe and in the Baron’s care...    "3/26/2018 16:17:15,Sil Andelmaus Tetheril,Elf,Cleric,"Sil was taken by drow slavers from her family when she was a child.  She was sold as a domestic servant, which she did into her teenage years.  Her servitude ended in what started as an unremarkable day.  She was washing some dishes when the goddess Sehanine whispered to her that her chance to escape was at hand.  Without hesitation, Sil heeded the divine guidance and followed its careful instructions leading her away from the house she worked in, through the depths of the Underdark, and into the sunlight of the world above.

She grew into a career of smuggling slaves escaped from the drow out of the Underdark and to contacts on the surface to start life anew.  That is until her adopted sister fell in with a band of questionable folk with a nose for trouble."3/26/2018 16:33:54,Mek Leth’Osh,Half-Orc,Fighter,"Mek Leth’Osh was born to Tagg Leth’Osh and Marianna Urquart on a muggy summer night nineteen years prior.  Her unwed parents, both adventurers by trade, had been a bit too “over-celebratory” and not quite so “over-celibatory” after the conclusion of a particularly arduous quest.  Upon discovering her condition, and weighing the possibility of finding employment as a rogue with a -25 modifier to stealth due to “screaming baby,” Marianna promptly inclined to leave her unnamed daughter in the care of the child’s father.  Henceforth nine months later, Tagg was not-so-pleasantly surprised to find a small shrieking bundle carefully laid inside the hut of his village, with only a small note, “Thanks for the memories Big T, but I believe this loot belongs to you,” as explanation.  The village didn’t think twice about her mixed parentage, as Tagg’s well-known heroic deeds had put him in a class above reproach.  And a few years later, Tagg found he rather enjoyed being a father.  His hardened warrior’s face softened with laugh lines as his small toddling daughter tried to put on his helmet, and proceeded to fall over due to the relative weigh of metal to child.  Tagg dazzled his young daughter with stories of his adventuring days: how he had single-handedly slain an entire band of marauding kobolds, how her mother had deservedly gotten a face-full of magic missiles when she tried to sneak a peak into a trapped chest they were supposed to be guarding, and how he had distracted a mock dragon long enough for her mother to sneak around behind it and deal a crippling blow.  Mek doted on her father, who was slowly starting to show his age, and vowed to make him proud by becoming a fierce fighter herself.  At the age of eight she begged him to let her learn swordplay.  Although he was hesitant to let her do anything dangerous (his fatherly nature winning against his Orcish bloodrage), he soon could be found dueling sticks with Mek in the village center (every so often exclaiming “Argh, you got me!” and falling overdramatically to the ground amidst his daughter’s fits of giggles.)  By the time she was thirteen, Mek was starting to show signs of womanhood.  She was easily considered the prettiest girl in the village, owing to the fact that her human blood had softened her Orcish features into something approximating femininity.  She was hard-pressed to find any suitors, however, because Tagg seemed to stare down any boy that looked even slightly amorously at his daughter (much to his daughter’s pouting).At the age of sixteen, Mek was “accepted” into the Guard of the Crimson Paw – a special branch of the village guard allegedly tasked with “escorting village elders to and from the big city” which lay a half-day’s journey away.  The elders went once or twice a month to stock up on hard-to-come-by supplies for the village, and to sell local trade goods.  She was told the journey to the city was long and difficult, and that she had to be ever-vigilant for danger.  (In actuality, though, the village elders simply did not want teenagers sneaking off to the city alone.  They had cunningly devised the “guard” as a way for teenagers to have a safe and sanctioned way to travel there without knowing that it was they themselves who were the ones being chaperoned.  The adults in the village are in on the joke, and persist in telling dramatic lies about the trip being dangerous to further discourage wanderlust.  The elders feel it is a win-win situation, however, as they are happy for the company, and they enjoy seeing the teenagers proud faces brimming with responsibility.) Tagg, of course knowing full well the true aims of the guard, decided to make a big show of being proud of his daughter anyway because he didn’t want to ruin her enthusiasm.  He gifted her with her first suit of armor, a shining breastplate with an emblazoned paw print on the front.Now nineteen, Mek still assists with the guard’s “educational field trips.”  Being an adult, she helps the elders watch over the “new recruits” who are visiting the city for the first time, delighting in teasing them with wild stories about potentially ferocious bugbears and hobgoblins who might be waiting to ambush them at any minute.  She can still feel her parents’ adventuring blood pumping in her veins, though, and wishes that one of those tall tales would actually come true so she could finally prove herself as a fighter and make her father genuinely proud.  However, the closest thing to action she has seen so far was when a particularly stupid band of thieves tried to intercept their group on the road.  The scoundrels were instantly caught in a reverse gravity spell from one of the elders, as the whole of the Crimson Paw looked on and roared with laughter."3/26/2018 16:58:21,Lady Orelka Meloros N’Dare ,Human,Sorcerer,"[Lord Archibald Regulas N’Dare is a sprightly and vigorous human noble of 68 years.  Being blessed with 13 daughters and one son, he has taken it upon himself to preserve his bloodline at all costs.  His eldest two daughters were married off to gain alliance with the local nobility, and the remaining girls have each been trained in one of the core classes with the specific goal being for them to serve as council and bodyguards for his heir.  However, his 17 year old daughter, Orelka, has proven somewhat of a problem child...]From an early age, it was known that Orelka was a “special” child.  Her great-great-great grandfather had been some sort of air-based outsider, and it was very clear she had inherited his temperament.  Calm and gentle at one moment, she would fly off the handle at the slightest provocation.  She would also spend hours perched on the roof spires like a gargoyle, claiming she liked to be near the sky.  Between her furies and her fearlessness of heights, she drove her parents to righteous indignation.  She was a beautiful child in an eerie sort of way, though, being dark-brown skinned with shimmering blue-white hair that almost seemed to blow by itself.  Recently her father apprenticed her to a sorcerer, hoping that she could channel her growing elemental powers into a more useful and controlled format; however Orelka seems to care little about her duties, and has instead developed a vanity for her unique physique and abilities.  He once caught her showing off for the local teenage ruffians by showering his freshly manicured court gardens with bolts of electrical damage!  This simply would not do.  She was going to learn to be a responsible and pedigreed Lady if it killed her.  When the announcement came of an elite police force being assembled, it was music to Lord N’Dare’s ears.  He could ship her off into service, let someone else sort out her “little quirks,” and have her come back home with battle experience to boot.  Thus, equipped with a bag of supplies compiled by maidservants, an outfit that was ostentatious enough to seem out-of-place, and a tornado of an attitude, Lady Orelka Meloros N’Dare was thrust into the outside world..."3/26/2018 17:53:19,Jemma Aurelian,Human,Fighter,"Jemma's last name isn't Aurelian, but her gold hair and love OF gold has earned her the title. The bounty hunter doesn't tell anyone her real last name, as it seems to be connected to a past she doesn't like to talk about with just any stranger or employer. It's not that she's unfriendly, so much as she simply keeps her conversation firmly focused on the present. Most at least know that she's originally from Waterdeep, and moved to Baldur's Gate nearly five years ago. That city has been her base of operations ever since, but it's not uncommon for her to go traveling far afield at the prospect of earning better money, or to track down particularly contemptible criminals.As a bounty hunter, Jemma's known for taking on bounties that fit with her own sense of right and wrong. This has lead her to accept jobs from all over the spectrum of legality on the Sword Coast, and to sometimes broker deals to settle jobs rather than stick to strictly capture/kill. Consequently, some of her employers respect her, while others feel her in-the-moment decisions undermine their authority. She occasionally mentions that she'd like to save up for a day when she can take on any job, regardless of the payout, so she can really start to do some good in the world."3/26/2018 18:31:21,Kira Westfall,human,rogue,"Kira has no memories of her family. She was raised at a well-known dueling academy near the Sea of Fallen Stars, where she attended classes in fencing, history, and etiquette along with the children of nobles and rich merchants. Most kids only stayed for a few years, but the academy was the only home Kira ever knew. She excelled in her schoolwork, and she also learned a few stealthier arts thanks to the kinds of things that lightly supervised teenagers tend to get up to while at boarding school. She and her friends let themselves into the school's administrative offices one night and learned that Kira had been left at the school at four years of age by someone who paid her entire tuition and fees in advance, but there was no record of who this mysterious benefactor might be. Kira began to believe that she was born out of wedlock to someone who had enough of a sense of responsibility to see to her welfare, but they clearly didn't want to be part of her life. That was fine by her though. When she graduated, she was planning to become an instructor at the school, but a pair of strange men arrived and explained they were taking her home. Even if they were on the level, Kira had no interest in rejoining the family who abandoned her. Unfortunately the men weren't inclined to take no for an answer. They tied her up and tossed her in a carriage. By the time she was able to escape, she decided it wasn't a great idea to go back to her school. That's the first place they'd look, and her presence would cause trouble for the people who'd raised her.Kira began to travel, and she moved from place to place often. Sometimes she still saw signs of pursuit. But after a year without any trace of being followed, she believed her supposed family may have given up hope of recovering her. She joined up with an adventuring group, and they did fairly well for themselves. Kira thought they were people she could rely on. Then they stumbled into a tavern and overheard the wrong set of rumors, and the next thing she knew, her companions had her drugged and bound and were looking around for a potential ransom. After a few nearly successful escape attempts, the group decided not to wait on the people who were looking for Kira. They found a group of slavers who knew there was a price on her head, and then they sold her.The slavers were secretly working for a medusa who had the habit of petrifying some of the more interesting people she captured. Kira was turned to stone for several years, until she was rescued by a different group of adventurers who'd hunted down the medusa.She'd been hidden away in the medusa's garden for long enough that Kira now hopes her family, or whoever they were, has stopped looking for her."3/26/2018 19:13:07,Quenten Auleris ,human,warlock,quenten was too cool for the rest of the normie warlocks in his city so he left to find a more fitting patron to serve. after wandering upon a black glass obelisk and being put through a trail of will in the shadowfell quenten was given the grace of the raven queen. he now serves her in the realm of the living finding her interesting souls to collect before they go to the 9 hells.3/26/2018 20:04:45,Blorp Blerg,SLIME,Shapeshifter,He was born by the toxic waste of a magician in the deepest trail of a strange dungeon.

The kind you would expect of any other Goliath youth.  We played, we hunted, we shared in challenge and honor, we lamented the loss of the once-proud, and we sought for ways to live life as fully as possible.  Occasionally we ran into a Dwarven outpost, or passed by a group of adventurous Humans, and we would trade our goods for weapons and crafts.  Mostly, though, we kept to ourselves.  I progressed within the tribe from berry-gatherer to weaver, then to assistant den-mother, and finally to hunter.  I was gruff, opinionated, homely, not well-spoken, and generally off-putting, but by the time I was 18, my skill with the business-end of a hammer was enough to gain the honor of my tribe – and the heart of a man.  Our Dawncaller, Gul’mok, fancied me for his wife.  I told him he could have me, but only if he could beat me in a climbing race – a race I did not anticipate losing.  I was over-confident in my skills, having never lost a fair match in hunting, wrestling, or rock scaling.  We agreed to a race up the cliff-face and back - whoever touched the ground first, won.  I was already halfway down by the time he’d even scaled the summit. In an act of desperation and love-blind bravado, he jumped off the top of the cliff instead of climbing to the ground, and while he did in fact reach the bottom before me, he broke his leg in the process.  I sighed at him and his childish stupidity, realizing I never technically specified he had to climb both ways. Yet, in that moment I was also touched by how hard he was willing to fight for me, and decided to honor our bargain and marry him after all.  He spent the next two weeks being shunned while he recovered from his injury.  During that time I only looked at him once, but he was smiling that ear-wide grin of his.  By all accounts we were a happy couple, always challenging each other, but never fighting.  A year later I bore him a son, but it was born early and weak.  It was the second-hardest lament I have endured in my life.  Later that year, Gul’mok woke early to sing the dawn praises, as was his custom every morning.  I left a while later with the hunting party, but when I returned that evening, Gul’mok was still absent.  He should have reached camp hours before me.  Suddenly I heard my name, gasped and hollow like a cave wind, and I turned.  Gul’mok was crawling into camp.  I could barely recognize him, so coated in blood was he.  He tried to speak, but all I could make out was “Move...camp...Orcs...hundreds...”  The Orcs had always stayed north of our mountains, kept in check by the Goblins of Hob.  It was never our fight or our concern...until now.  The fact that the Orcs were boldly pushing as far south as here meant that Hob’s power must be weakening.  If they were attacking and invading any peoples who stood in their way, without provocation or ethics, than we had a large-scale problem brewing.  Our tribe, while harsh, had always lived life by rules and fairness.  These Orcs, however, lived by little more than violence and depravity – mere savages whose breath was as dirty as their fighting. With Hob’s defense cracking, someone had to step in and uphold the balance of order, to remain a steadfast wall in the face of impending destabilization, and somehow this called for more than a good shunning. The elders were not going to charge into a fight they could not win, though, and immediately made plans to move camp again.  I knew Gul’mok would not survive the night, let alone a move, so I asked that we be exiled together rather than leaving with the rest of the tribe.  I bit my tongue as I watched my people embark on a path of fear, running with their tails between their legs while our enemies went unchecked, while my husband’s assailants went unchecked. I was vehement and filled with a vengeance I could not contain.  The Orcs had crossed a line, and I would not let any more suffer like my husband had.  In the morning I planned to seek out a way to bring the Orcs to justice. Even if I stood alone, I would protect and restore our lands, our way of life, our honor.  I would always remember the cacophony of that night – the cries of the lamenters amid the chaos of packing and carting – fading into a still silence as in one pivotal hour all I had ever known vanished down a darkened mountain path, leaving my world shattered.  Alone with my husband, sitting by the smoldering embers of the dying fire, I tried to bandage his wounds.  I knew it was in vain, but it kept my mind focused.  We fell asleep in each other’s arms, and I awoke holding death.  Once-proud Vae’Ulov Feast-Bringer re-forged into exiled Vae’Ulov Dawn-Widow.  I set off toward the only peoples I thought might aid me in my cause, an outpost of Dwarven border guards we were on friendly terms with.  It was a one week hike south through the mountain passes, and I was never very good with directions.  It took me twelve days to find my way.  When I reached the outpost, the Dwarves were in full battle gear.  Apparently word had spread of the Orcs uprising, and the Dwarves had sighted incursions into their own territory.  Admitting we had a common enemy, I asked if I could help.  The outpost allowed me to camp with them, and in exchange for aiding them with hunting and standing watch, they offered military training so I could better defend myself.  Over the next 169 days, they bored me with stories of their kings and nobles, taught me to ride a horse and wear plated armor, equipped me with gear of unspeakable craftsmanship, and did their best to “culture” me as we fought side by side.  When the news finally came that Hob’s last stronghold had fallen, rumors began to spread that a group of warriors from every race were gathering into one untied army to make a definitive stand against the Orcish hoard.  I was invited to ride along with the local Dwarven envoy, having proven myself an able-bodied ally..."3/26/2018 21:16:46,Fú g_ xi_ng ying,Catfolk,Bard,"Fú g_ xi_ng ying was born in a remote catfolk village, nestled along the tree line of the auspicious mountain range that cuts through the province of Anhui in Lian. The runt child in an ominously-numbered litter of four, her parents always feared for her fate – for while she was beautiful and captivating, her health was far more frail than her brothers and sister. Thus, while her siblings busied themselves with fur-flying tussles and childish games, she was kept apart due to worries over her delicate constitution. She often found herself drawn to keeping company with the elders who sat in the town square playing small metal drums, beating earthen fou, and marking time on fish-shaped muyus. The echo of the percussion seemed to echo the heartbeat and rhythm of the village itself. She was fascinated by this innate ability of sound to evoke such vivid images of life – how hearing the drums instantly brought up visions of her mother banging around in the kitchen, or how the muyus seemed to mimic the clacking of wooden sandals on brick. In time she would grow to see the world through these terms. If you were to ask her now where she comes from, she would play you the sound of wind howling through Huangshan pine, of rain cascading off a tiled pagoda, or cicadas humming against cypress bark. She would simulate the hammering of craftsmen, the gentle scraping of ink against stone, the soft swish of silk beizi over hand-embroidered floor mats, the skittering patter of kittens running underfoot… To her, vocal communication is inefficient. Any attempt to describe a sunset, or a rainstorm, or a memory, or a feeling through words is reductive, derivative, and imperfect at best – like a child trying to draw a flower, it loses something in translation. She views pure sound, unshackled from the bonds of language, as a higher form of art. The others in her village initially laughed at the idea of this girl who barely speaks, and who views singing as “the high-pitched caterwauling of women masquerading as perpetually-surprised children,” wanting to train as a bard, but they eventually relented, recognizing her natural talent of turning any object she found into a percussive foley tool.Through the course of her studies she not only perfected her soundscape talents, but was also taught the ancient clan art of Anhui Nuo dance - a fearsome performance of stilts and masks. She learned that although she was physically weak, she could combine her skills to control the battlefield - frightening enemies down to their very core without needing to land a single blow. Now, no longer a protected flower but a fully-empowered adult, she has set off on her own paws to explore new lands and discover new sounds."3/26/2018 21:22:05,Creedy,Elan,psychic warrior,"Created by undersea horrors to infiltrate and destroy humanity, creedy quickly blew his cover in an attempt to seem honest and avoid confusion.

From an early age, Ollie learned that if he spent enough time tinkering, he could pick up just about any skill (much to the infuriation of his parents and siblings when he knew more than he should, could get into more difficult places than he should, and had others’ possessions in his keeping more often than he should).  However, he doesn’t consider himself a thief or anything of the sort, he simply believes in the equal distribution of goods and information, and in mandatory charitable donations.  Being a dashing (well, he has good hair at least), daring (machismo), courageous (dumb bravado), and… wait, no, he doesn’t really care all that much… youth, he was always the first to rush into situations, yet he had enough wits about himself to not be completely reckless (i.e. to blame the other guys first).   When he was 53, he left his hometown because he honestly believed that he was too manly for the good of the village.  If he had stayed, the other men would have felt inferior and jealous by comparison, and the girls would have fought over him and had their hearts broken. He wanted to save the villagers from this cruel fate by going to live amongst other races who might not be as vulnerable to his virile charms. (The townspeople kindly waited until he was out of hearing range to double-over in laughter.)  After he left home, he made his living by doing odd jobs that piqued his fancy as he traveled, including scouting, bodyguarding, negotiating, recovering “lost” objects, and the occasional children’s party.  One day he chose to start worshiping the deity Kord because he heard Kord was strong and muscular - the epitome of manliness - and he figured they had a lot in common; although Ollie prefers the masculine grace of dexterous athletic skill over pure mindless brawling. He fancies himself a sort of “Chuck Norris Robin Hood,” but in actuality he has more in common with the likes of Nobby Nobbs.He likes to be prepared for anything, and has pocketfuls of junk that he keeps in his vest because he never knows when it might come in handy, although he is often not resourceful enough to ever use the items in any helpful way, so they continue to pile up.Ollie’s quirks include never being able to say no to an attractive (to him) female, calling everyone he meets “girlie” regardless of their actual gender (because no one else is as many as he is), taking every opportunity to pose and show off his manly physique, and whittling.

Using his charm and acumen he managed to curry favor with the king, earning himself a title in exchange for his contacts and expert council. With her grandfather’s aid, the king was able to expand trade routes further than ever before, importing exotic luxuries and a wealth of new information.However, after the king’s second son murdered the heir apparent and attempted to assassinate his father in a play for the throne, Gwynedd’s family knew their privileged life was on the verge of toppling. Before word of the kingdom’s troubles spread, Gwynedd’s grandfather secured a betrothal for his son, then a boy of only ten, to a young Elven noble far across the sea. He had hoped to train his son in the mercantile trade, but the boy was too spoiled and lacking in wits to be any kind of protégé, so potentially marrying him off to cement a bond with the Elves was the only use that could come from him.Eventually the prince succeeded in his machinations and ascended to the throne. Her grandfather visited the usurper in the hope he could somehow continue to live in the lap of luxury, but the new king was bold and arrogant, and rejected the old man’s help. However, by a stroke of good fortune, the prince soon took an Elven bride, and her grandfather used his influence with the Elven people to win her ear and monopolize trade routes between the two kingdoms for the next several years.Gwynedd’s father, now a strapping young officer of 18, finally came of age to marry his betrothed, but shortly after the wedding, Gwynedd’s grandfather fell victim to a freak storm and his ship was lost at sea. Her father was now the sole heir to a vast trade empire, suddenly making him a very wealthy and powerful noble - a wealthy and powerful noble with the business sense and charisma of a decomposing turnip.He squandered most of the money away on lavish gifts for his new wife, who, it turned out, was just as much of a ninny as him, and within a few years they had run the company near into the ground through mismanagement and incompetence. By the time Gwynedd was born, the family was destitute and cut off from all lines of credit and influence, yet still clung proudly to their noble title.Lady Gwynedd was a child cursed by fate. Born with exceptional beauty and flawless talent, she was scorned by women and objectified by men. Seeing in her gifts a last ditch effort to regain favor with the other noble houses, her parents decided to use her as a pawn. She was trained to sing, dance, recite poems, and play a variety of instruments, and then paraded from parlor to parlor like some exotic caged bird. Admirers fought for her presence at their parties, and showered her with presents (all of which were pawned to make ends meet and keep up appearances).As she grew up, she was better able to hone her skills to captivate and charm her audience, and soon had a following of potential wealthy suitors. When she reached the minimum legal age, her parents married her off to the wealthiest of the bunch, expecting her to supply them with the necessary income to maintain their immoderate lifestyle.Her new husband was an abusive drunkard with no respect for her, though, and she saw a chance to escape after he got himself killed in an alcohol-induced altercation. She was sick of being a pawn, and disgusted with the petty childishness of her family and the rest of the corrupt nobility that approved any and all methods of keeping themselves in power - even to the point of letting a murderer sit on the throne and letting liches infiltrate the city.She decided to take her husband’s wealth and her freedom into her own hands, transforming herself into a secretive vigilante, “The Mask of Thorns.” In her new role, she helped a group of adventurers rid the city of the undead threat, then turned her attention to the arrogant elite and lowly bandits that ran rampant through the streets, both having an equal hand in making life miserable for the common people. Her calling card was a stem of thorns, symbolizing the choked and stagnant state of the kingdom. Though her punishments were harsh, they were non-violent – her goal was to shock and scare (and possibly humiliate), not to kill.(Perhaps she should have studied combat more effectively, though, as she met an untimely end at the hands of a 4-armed sniper during the very first wave of the demonic invasion of the city.

While in school he caught the eye of a fairly prominent wizard by the name of Luce who asked Harper to become his assistant. Harper quickly discovered, unfortunately, that Luce was not a wizard but a powerful lich that enjoyed practicing necromancy and other dark arts and bound Harper to him to do his bidding. He was stuck under Luce's control for many years until the goddess Wee Jas appeared to him and promised to help free him if he destroyed Luce and pledged his life to her. He agreed and with his new divine powers he banished Luce and was able to rescue the other souls trapped in his mansion. After that Harper became a wandering cleric until he eventually met Sei, an elven healer, and his daughter Sera. Sei and Harper fell in love and eventually married, and now run a clinic together. Harper now occasionally does freelance work for the (since retired) world renowned detective/author Renee Redmoore.

There she met her future wife, a fae duchess, who also became her warlock patron and gave her powers. Poe began living nomadically, helping around the country where she could."3/27/2018 13:07:03,Mr. Giggles,Halfling,Barbarian,"Mr. Giggles, as he likes to call himself, is a dude who just doesn’t understand life.  To him, dad jokes are real, pizza is scary, and his best friend in the world is his axe named Helga.  But Mr. Giggles isn’t crazy.  Rather, he’s just clueless how to live among people.It all began many years ago when Giggles was born Felldrop Smartbriar to the Smartbriar clan of Halflings in the village of Forgetmenot.  Felldrop’s father Spelldrop and his mother Dropdrop (known as Dropsie) had a long history of eccentricity, even in a place as weird as Forgetmenot...a town that was named, incidentally, after the regional government forget all about it for over a century due to a drunken scribe’s geographic oversight.  Located high in the Neverease Mountains, Forgetmenot was visited only by local yak herders,  lost mountain climbers, and holy pilgrims.Among even this village of loners, Spell and Dropsie were even further ostracized.  Spell, an herbalist and tea maker, had congenital narcolepsy, and would often fall down in the streets due to what his neighbors referred to as the sleeping sickness.  Spelldrop explained away his episodes with regular exhortations about being up late the previous night, or inadvertently mixing his herbs.  Hence, the nickname Spelldrop.  (No one recalls, nor cares, what his real name was and because Spelldrop secretly liked the attention, he avoided his real name as well.)Dropsie, like her husband, had a moniker that fit her personality.  She was clumsy.  But because Dropdrop was her given name (something about how her parents liked hearing the sound of rain, which itself was unusual so high in the mountains), it’s difficult to say if the name made her clumsy or if her parents were simply augurs.  Either way, if a villager wanted something broken, he’d hand it to Dropsie.  Spelldrop’s friends tried warning him of his girlfriend’s powers inopportune powers but, alas, he had a narcoleptic episode in the middle of their speech and they neglected to finish the story when he awoke.Conventional wisdom suggests either that Dropsie performed one of her clumsy maneuvers on her son or his father had an episode atop him, or perhaps both.  No matter how you cut it, though, Felldrop never had a chance at a normal life.  This led to much resentment and anger.By the time he was thirteen, Felldrop was known for his temper, and the local boys would tease him mercilessly just to watch him fly into rages.  A passing holy man saw one of these events and gave Felldrop a small hand axe, thinking it would allow the boy to focus his passion.  Instead, it led to bloodshed: Felldrop slaughtered every small animal he could catch.  The town boys quickly learned to avoid him, especially when he had the axe with him.  And in a village as small as Forgetmenot, this was no mean feat!At twenty, Felldrop had proven that he was incapable of being around others.  His friends had long since abandoned him and even his parents were scared to be around him.  He had taken to talking to his axe, which he’d named Helga, and he treated it like a girlfriend, often being seen caressing it in public.  On the eve of his 21st birthday, then, it was no surprise when Felldrop announced that he would be leaving Forgetmenot with the next yak herding caravan that passed through town.Felldrop traveled with the yak herders only a short time.  Within two weeks, he’d realized that there was far more to the work than just yak wool, and far more to his temper than just small animals.  It came to a head one night when he attacked one of the yaks.  The animal, far larger than he, gave him a good drubbing.  Felldrop ran off into the night, smelling of yak and urine.For many months, Felldrop roamed the lands, eating wild berries and scavenging raw meat from smelly carcasses.  In that time, he saw no other people, and the wild rages of passion quickly overcame him.  By the time he wandered into another civilized town, Axeborough (a fitting name) 300 miles from Forgetmenot, he had lost the ability both to speak the common tongue and to interact properly with other humanoids.  He had become a full barbarian.For approximately three years, Felldrop lived on the outskirts of Axeborough, only rarely interacting with other humanoids.  It wasn’t until a band of orc raiders attacked the town that Felldrop was drawn back into social contact.When the orcs attacked the town, a vicious battle ensued.  Felldrop watched from a safe distance and was amazed at the prowess of the raiders.  They mowed down the town guard with such ferocity and precision that Felldrop was awestruck.  Afterward, when the fighting had ended and the raiders had made off into the night with their booty, Felldrop gave chase.  He came upon their came about an hour later and walked in like he owned the place.  He was quickly overwhelmed and tied to a roasting spit.  The orcs danced around him and laughed, forcing him into deeper and deeper anger.  When the tide of emotion finally broke, Felldrop let out a primal yell, snapped his bonds, lifted the roasting pin over his head and plunged it into the chest of the nearest orc.  Before any of the orcs could react, their leader, a half-Orc man in his fifties or so, approached Felldrop.  He admired the little runt’s tenacity and decided to teach him how to be a raider, especially since they currently had an opening thanks to Felldrop’s anger.The leader of the orcs, named Kruger, was himself a barbarian, and he carried an icy hammer on his back and wore little more than the orcs themselves.  He was as battle-hardened and as bloodthirsty as they were, and so Felldrop couldn’t have asked for a better teacher.  And yet Kruger was merciless to Felldrop, always inciting him to anger and always at unlikely moments.  Kruger’s approach was to keep Felldrop guessing, but Felldrop was never able to make the cognitive leap required to read a scene and to surmise how events might play out.  As a result, Felldrop would go into his battle rages at all the wrong times, such as when eating, or getting ready for bed, or doing his business in the bushes.  Kruger found this all kinds of hysterical and never bothered to inform Felldrop of the right way to do things.Felldrop spent several years traveling with Kruger until the band was decimated by a patrol of Elven cavalry, which had been hunting them for some time.  Kruger was killed in the battle and Felldrop was “saved” when the warriors thought he was a child.Felldrop eventually got away from the elves, who had tried to adopt him and teach him their ways, and has been wandering since.  On the rare occasion that he crossed paths with other humanoids, most were drawn to his passion but put off by his anger.  And, in the end, Felldrop was left wanting something he couldn’t even name.  Eventually, he attempted to draw people to him to ward off his loneliness by adopting the moniker “Mr. Giggles”.  Some kids once called him that and he likes the idea that if anyone laughs at him, it will be the last thing that person ever does."3/27/2018 15:47:21,Lucrezia di Conza,Human,Inquisitor,"Lucrezia hails from the fair city of Firenze, Italia. While unacknowledged, she has had access from a young age to an excellent education and privileges as the bastard child of Pope Clement VIII. Upon his death in 1605, her position in society became much more tenuous. She is seeking to consolidate her position within the Catholic Church as an inquisitor through the accumulation of magical items."3/27/2018 16:08:44,Euzalia,teifling,sorcerer,"Euzalia grew up surrounded by family on a isolated homestead. Her grandmother directed this small clan of tielfings in their daily labors of farming, sheep herding, and all the other tasks necessary to maintain the homestead. They lived not too far away from a small human settlement where they often traded their products for the goods that they could not produce themselves. Despite multiple visits to this village, Euzalia remained naive to human traditions as the human's prejudice against tieflings kept her and her cousins from making any close friends there. As Euzalia grew she started to manifest many magical powers, often creating floating lights to entertain her little nieces and nephews and once stopping a group of sheep from running away in fear with her magic. Her grandmother identified this talent as the gift that occasionally appeared in family members due to their tiefling heritage, but no one encouraged Euzalia to develop her gifts, viewing them as interesting, but not particularly useful. As a young adult, Euzalia was once sent to trade at in the village without the supervision of her older family members. This visit ended in disaster when she lost her temper at a rude shopkeeper and set his house on fire. Euzalia insisted that it was a complete accident, but it seems more likely that the only accident was how out of control the flames became. Although no one was hurt in this incident, the villagers were understandably upset. Seeing the risk of mob violence, Euzalia's family, led by her grandmother, sent her away under the cover of night with instructions to not return until she had mastered better control of her powers and some time had past to allow tempers to die down. Euzalia respected the decision of her family and set our to see a bit of the world. As she traveled, she discovered that there was a lot more to the world than small villagers and homesteads. She loves seeing new things and is very curious about new people and places. Although she can be hesitant to trust strangers, she can be overly trusting of her friends and very easily influenced by peer pressure and others' opinions. Her immediate instinct is often to protect herself at the expense of others, but if reminded that that action would be morally wrong, she will decided to do the right thing (unless under the threat of mob violence, which she wants to avoid at all costs). She is much more likely to do go when others are watching as she wished to give a good impression of tieflings. She cared about her own personal honor, but not about the laws of some distant king. Despite her families' concerns, she has no fear of her sometimes uncontrollable magic and will laugh at the unintended consequences of her spells."3/27/2018 19:41:30,Kalta,Human,Fighter,Kalta was part of an all female guard at a temple in the mountains.

His coat is red, copper colored (# D48E02, strips on the horn # 9C6802), and the mane is brown, almost black (# 4A3901). The shape of the mane is a narrow (3/4 of the distance between the ears) and relatively short (just below the ears) vertical brush, extending to the neck. Purple eyes (# E70AFF). Cutiemark - three pulleys of different diameters, connected by straps. The unicorn himself is quite muscular, tall and tightly knocked down. He is dressed in a cuirass. It automatically opens the wings, allowing the unicorn to soar, and not to fall from high places. The cuirass is additionally covered from the inside with a warm cloth.As a weapon, the unicorn uses two broadswords, inlaid with singing stones: the first with a flaming topaz and a glowing amethyst, the second with an icy sapphire and a glowing amethyst. Since recently, the unicorn wears the red fragment of Stalliongrad as a cloak with the coat of arms on its entire back. Steam was also put on all four hoofs. A small crossbow with a 6-bolt loading mechanism is attached to the left front nugget.Parents and ChildhoodTinker (for friends simply - Tink) was born and raised in the north, almost on the very border with Yakyakistan, in the Crystal Mountains in a small village. Even before his birth, his father, adventurer and warrior Whirlwind (Whirlwind, Whirlwind) left his mother, going on another adventure. No one in the village knows his real name, Whirlwind is a nickname given to Tink's father by fellow adventurers for his crowning reception - Blade Whirlwind. Both Tink's father and mother are unicorns. Tink's mother - Snowdrop Radiance (Snowflake) is a graduate of the Royal Academy of Mages. She is a silver-colored unicorn with a white mane and a cutie mark. After graduation, she decided to fight evil, joining a group of adventurers, in which there was Whirlwind. Whirlwind and the Snowdrop became friends after a dangerous adventure, in which they were left alone in the middle of the ziggurat and only the swords of the Whirlwind and the protective magic of the Snowflake helped them to escape. They became a couple and could no longer imagine life and adventures without each other. After a couple of years of active adventure, Whirlwind and Snowdrop got married and went to live in a remote northern village to peacefully build a future for their children. The villagers took the couple favorably. A graduate of the Royal Academy, and even a doctor, quickly found a job in the village, as well as her husband, who owned super-powerful telekinesis capable of raising a small log cabin. After several years of peaceful rural life in this small oasis in the middle of the icy mountains, Snowflake began to notice her Virl more and more with a distant and unfocused look. She was already at that time on a short pregnancy with Tink and his twin sister Radiant Solace (Radi) and was afraid to tell Whirl about her burden. Pregnancy passed easily, and inexperienced in the mare's constitution, Whirlwind joked over the fat, in his opinion, Snowdrop. She doubted for a long time, but when she was determined to tell that day and that morning, Whirlwind disappeared from the village. He left a confusing note that he loved Snowflake, but that the old enemies found him here and that he does not want to bring trouble to her and his fellow villagers, will carry away the danger behind him. At first, Snowdrop had a very hard time and suffered from such a hasty disappearance of her husband, but two months later she found the strength to cope with this and successfully resolved from the burden with the help of kind-hearted fellow-villagers, whom she helped several times already. Two foals appeared in the world, which surprised Snowdrop and her fellow villagers. Young unicorns grew quickly, listening to the mother's stories about adventures, dangers and true love. On the questions about the their father, she always responded with the words of his note and sincerely believed that he was still alive and protecting Equestria from evil. But, despite this, Snowdrop did not agree to teach the children her magic. Tink was fascinated by his father's images and wanted to become like him. His art of telekinesis grew rapidly. Foals learned to write and read. For several years of living in the village of Snezhinka with Whirlwind gathered a small library. Some of the books Snowflake brought with them, some they bought from visiting traders. Tink read out the ""Adventure Guide"". At the age of fourteen, her mother reluctantly let him go to a neighboring town, agreeing finally to train and Radi, realizing that she could not keep them forever under the light of her horn.YouthOnce in the city, Tink was struck. Stone houses ascended to an unreal height in 4 floors, and the tower of the Town Hall - on 8 floors with a belfry. A diverse, multiracial crowd of the central market took him to the station, which Tinka most surprised him-he was lucky enough to get into the city exactly at the time when the train left the station. A huge mass of cars moved and went by herself, without the help of a pony. A young unicorn ran around the station trying to understand how it happened, but it was necessary to go to the master. The snowflake sent Tinka as a disciple to her friend, the unicorn technician Steam Flare. At the beginning, Flare gave Tink simple tasks - he did not know what Tink was capable of. Tink learned how to screw up nuts and screws with telekinesis, lift and move complex mechanical devices without namagicizing them. Gradually the master warmed to the pupil, trusting him with more and more responsible tasks. Master told Tink how different mechanisms work. The unicorn, though absorbing the knowledge of jerkcraft as a sponge, still missed the house, wrote letters to his mother and sesres, and once every two or three weeks the master let him go home. After a couple of years of training, Tink learned to at least write and read. The master taught him to read and create drawings. Tink met the age of complete ignorance, although he was sure that his life would be connected with the jackcraft. Once in the workshop to Flare came a strange client - he was clearly not a city dweller, from his saddle bags looked the handle of something resembling a sword. He was dressed in a black cloak, connected with a black helmet-mask with strange protruding ears on his head. He asked to make for him an unusual device - a pistol shooting a hook with a rope, which this mechanism should pull up. The master entrusted the creation of this mechanism to his student. Strange customer demanded to monitor each stage of creating the device - the master did not refuse him. Tink drew a mechanism, showed the master and the client and began to collect it. The client did not fill anything in the drawings, but trusted the word of the Master, who, with a grin, said that the mechanism would work as the client wants. In the process of drafting, Tink kept throwing short glances at an unusual client. He did not seem to notice them, studying the goods and details of various products. In the end, curiosity prevailed over Tink and he asked why the client had such a strange weapon. In response, the strange pony smiled and began to tell the working Tinka about his adventures in big cities with skyscrapers and strange ponies that want other ponies only evil. His stories were full of daring arrests and pursuit on steam wagons. Tink listened and remembered the mother's stories about his father and their adventures. Gradually, in his telekinesis, a device with three large pulleys emerged, activating its elements from a small steam engine on the crystals. Turning the last bolt into the device, which took the form of a strange kind of knight, Tink felt a strange tingling in the sides. Suddenly the light shone from him in all directions - the unicorn got its own cutie mark. Three pulleys on the cutie mark resembled those that were on the device. The master went down to look at the strange light shining in the workshop. Tink handed him the device for verification. - Excellent design, and this drive, even I, I think, could not come up with more effective - praised the unicorn Flare. With this praise began the creative life of the red pony. An unusual pony left his business card:Darr Veter Senior Lecturer, Chairman of the Scientific Council Higher Technical College of Stalliongrad ""So that's where you come from!"" - Tink remarked with surprise, and the master only grinned into his apron. - If you are interested in adventure and technology, come to study with us, Tinker. Your task was an entrance exam. - on a muzzle of the young unicorn, surprise, joy and uncertainty turned in turn. He turned to the master. - Again, you take away my pupils, a cunning fox, - Flare looked at Darr Vetra with a light reproach, but through it shone difficultly hidden heat. - His invitation to anything you do not oblige Tinker. ""All right,"" the unicorn picked up a business card with telekinesis and hid it in saddlebags. ""I'll take this into consideration,"" he said, trying to be as neutral as possibleAdulthoodBut, despite all the neutrality and coldness in his voice, Tink could not refrain from knowing what kind of Higher Technical School he had been invited to. Mother Tinka on this occasion came to the city with her daughter, who by that time learned a lot from her mother. The mother initially objected a little, but was convinced Flare of the need for this training for the better future of her son. Obliging Tinka to write letters and, if possible, go home, his mother and sister went back to the village, and he began to collect things. The journey on the Stalingradsky train even more convinced him of the fidelity of his path. Tink settled in the hostel of the VTOS. Around him, a small group of like-minded people gathered and found several enemies - the unicorn stood out in a stream that consisted mainly of an earth-sitter - in one of the parallel groups Pegasus studied, who also joined the mug, as they were called on the stream, ""Crazy Inventors"". The school required attendance at lectures and good progress, but provided some freedom for its students. Members of the circle Tinka had time to learn and work - they had little money, which they spent on the purchase of various details. Then the circle gathered and often, in the silence of the night, explosions and gnashing of metal rattled. The administration of the hostel made comments and punished them, forcing them to sort out the consequences of their failures. But high scores in various competitions inside the VTsU provided this pony with immunity from exclusion. After the third year, most of the guys from the ""Crazy Inventors"" at a special meeting about their next victory were invited to join a secret organization - the Gray Knights. Those who could not receive training for various reasons, erased the memory. Of those who remained assembled the team and began to teach the possession of weapons. Tink was one of the first who learned to own swords. The team's talents gradually developed. The team was gradually invited to clean ziggurats, first as support. Magic unicorn himself studied, improving what turned out better. At the same time, for money, saved from dangerous adventures, Tink bought a cooperative 5-room apartment near the VTUs. His official work was the repair and creation of new models of electric and steam transport."3/28/2018 7:32:51,Thynemarine ,Tiefling,Bard,"Charismatic; a true performer and an artist.

Brak the Cursed was born in the year 6108 to Lorkus, a female Orc Shaman once revered by her tribe for both her visions and for the herbal healing potions she would prepare during times of disease or battle.  However, Lorkus fell into disfavor with the tribal elders due to the bizarre circumstances surrounding Brak’s conception and birth.  Shortly before Brak’s conception, Lorkus began to have visions and dreams of an impending doom that would be visited upon her tribe or perhaps all of Middle Earth.  During one of her visions, she was visited by a human glowing in blue light who laid with her.  At first she dismissed the event as a mere vision, but then 6 months later she gave birth to a thin Half-Orc baby with strange glyph birthmarks covering his back.Despite all previous service that Lorkus had provided to her tribe, the elders saw Lorkus’ vision, her mysterious pregnancy, and Brak’s strange birthmarks as bad omens.  The baby, they declared, was cursed with what appeared to be Elvish Ruins.  Lorkus and her newborn baby were banished from the tribe. For months Lorkus travelled alone through the wilds on the outskirts of both Orc and Human society.  She eked out a meager existence that allowed her to nurse Brak, but slowly drained her reserves.  One night she was attacked by wolves.  While she protected Brak from harm, Lorkus was mortally wounded.  With her life force draining and knowing that any Orc will likely make a sacrifice out of Brak, Lorkus carried Brak in the direction of the nearest human settlement.  As twilight breaks she found herself on a farm at the outskirts of New Breverik.  With luck, the farmer was blind and did not appear to recognize her Orcish nature.  The kindly farmer took them both in and he tended to Lorkus’ wounds as best he could, but it was clear from the moment of her arrival that she was on borrowed time.  Grateful for his kindness in her final moments, Lorkus confesses her story and her nature to the kindly farmer who promises to care for Brak after her passing.  After her passing, the farmer placed Lorkus’ effects aside and buried her on his farmstead.  The farmer, Olaf, nursed and raised Brak as his own.  At first, the people of New Breverik were disturbed by Olaf’s young ward and many complaints are made before the town council.  But the council was unable to discover any precedence to act upon and tells the people of New Breverik that they must honor and respect the decisions that Olaf makes; especially those that are made upon and regarding his farmstead.  While the people of New Breverik were never truly accepting of Brak, they eventually accept Olaf’s decision and resign themselves to the fact that Brak will be sharing their valley for the foreseeable future.   At the age of 10 Brak is large enough to start running the farm under the management and tutelage of Olaf.  Brak works the fields and tries to avoid contact with the humans of the valley and only occasionally goes into New Breverik.  In the evenings, Olaf teaches Brak reading, writing, and arithmetic and is pleasantly surprised at Brak’s ability to quickly learn complex concepts.  After Brak’s arrival the farmstead only retains one regular visitor, Skallagrím.  Skallagrím is a local herbalist who is fast friends with Olaf and is fascinated with Brak’s story.  While Brak is still a youngster, Skallagrím discovers that Brak has an amazing gift for preparing herbal remedies, perhaps inherited from his mother.  During his visits, Skallagrím teaches Brak about herbs and their preparation and application.When Brak is a young man of 16 years he witnesses an event of immense cruelty in the town of New Breverik which reminds him that Human culture and Orc culture are not divided by that wide of a gulf.  Unn, one of the daughters of the farmer Eirik, is accused of witchcraft, sorcery, and wizardry after she cures a boy's leg which had been crushed under an ox cart.  After a perfunctory trial in front of the town elders, and despite the fact that no one was harmed by her magics, she is sentenced to death by fire in the town's center.  Olaf Doomhammer, New Breverik’s high priest to Thor and also a Dwarf, tried to interfere with the town elders’ judgment and the building of the pyre; however, the people of New Breverik feared Unn’s potential magic more than they feared Thor’s potential wrath.  Olaf is held fast while Unn is burned alive.  During Olaf’s waning years, Brak comforts him by preparing herbal medicinals and poultices that alleviate Olaf’s chronic pain.  In the year 6129 Olaf passes, but not before performing two final acts.  First, Olaf passes onto Brak the possessions that Lorkus had left behind when she died on the farmstead years before.  Second, Olaf arranges for Skallagrím to take Brak on as his understudy.  Brak buries Olaf on the farmstead and quietly departs for Skallagrím’s camp.Skallagrím lives in an abandoned mining camp in the mountains just south of New Breverik where he roams the rough terrain in search of the herbs, roots, and other ingredients for the herbal treatments that he sells to the citizens of the valley.  Brak spends a short time with Skallagrim, but is restless following the death of Olaf.  Brak decides that it is time to try and make a connection with his Orcish side and sets off to locate the tribe of his mother.  Brak spends a few years in Orcish society, but ultimately determines that he is even more of an outcast there than in New breverik.  Both Humans and Orcs shun and ostracize Brak, but at least Human society is filled with a range of viewpoints and philosophies on the world that range from good to evil and from lawful to chaotic; here Brak at least fit on the spectrum.  In Orcish society, Brak only witnessed slavish obedience to cruel and evil masters.  In 6131 he returns to New Breverik and to Skallagrim.Skallagrim is happy to see Brak return.  Shortly after, Skallagrím takes Brak into his confidence and shows Brak that he, Skallagrím, is in actuality a Wizard who has retired from adventuring following a tragic encounter with a Landshark that killed his friends and left him as the sole survivor.  Since moving in with Skallagrím, Brak has found it necessary to travel into town more often in order to make purchases for the camp and while delivering the herbal remedies that Skallagrim makes for the people of the valley.  Brak has been befriended by a man in town named Fordin.  Fordin runs a small business where he employs mule barges and teamsters to ferry goods up and down the river.  Fordin’s enterprise is responsible for about 15% of the river traffic in and out of New Breverik and his travels provide him with a greater understanding of the world's diversity and a more open mind regarding Brak’s Half-Orc nature.Brak begins to learn the ways of magic.  Skallagrím’s first lesson for Brak is to be very careful with whom he takes into his confidence regarding his studies of the magic arts.  He is reminded of the trial and punishment of Unn.  Beyond the simple teachings of the magic arts, Skallagrím shares two more things with Brak; his theory of magic and his compendium of renowned users of magic.Skallagrím’s theory of magic is based upon years of study and travel and the review of ancient manuscripts.  On occasion, Halfdan Runeaxe, a cleric to Thor, has been of great assistance to Skallagrím.  Halfdan is a Dwarf attached to New Breverik’s Vigilance Committee and is also a collector of rare and ancient manuscripts.  On many occasions he has assisted Skallagrím with the research and formation of his theory.  Skallagrím is confident that his theory accounts for all the evidence that he has accumulated.  Skallagrím’s theory is only known by a few magic using friends that he has shared it with, and Skallagrím admits that not many other users of magic appear to care about the potential sources of their powers.      Skallagrím’s compendium of users of magic is based mostly upon his review of Halfdan’s manuscripts.  It represents knowledge that he was not initially looking for, but could not ignore or avoid as he was researching his theory of magic.  He felt it best to record some short notes regarding each user of magic that he encountered in the ancient scripts.Very recently Brak and Skallagrím have noticed that Brak’s dreams occasionally appear to be related to events that occur in the future.  Skallagrím believes that Brak may have inherited these abilities from his mother and has begun to study Brak in his sleep to see if he can determine how and when such predictive dreams are triggered."3/28/2018 21:44:33,Astrid,Human,Paladin,"AstridIt is the year 6133.  Your first memory is from the year 5783, the end of the Fourth age of Chaos and the beginning of the Fourth Age of Mankind.  You were discovered wandering the wooded hills in the southern reaches of Middle Earth by a patrol of humans; though you have a vague sense that you had been wandering in a daze through the greater region for weeks if not months.  The humans surprised you while you were feeding on a recent catch and they would later relate to you that you were feral in appearance and action and that it took the entire party to subdue you.  The humans took you back to their commune, a settlement of several hundred humans hidden in the middle of the Hyborean Bog.  According to stories, songs, and lore of the commune, it had been founded near the beginning of the Fourth Age of Chaos by several local farming communities that had been overrun by Orcs, Goblins and more.  At first they were excited to see another Human as their commune had not seen outsiders in approximately 25 years.  Their patrols had been encountering fewer and fewer Orcs, Goblins and the like and the discovery of a Human seemed like a good omen.  However, their initial excitement waned when they discovered you were not Human and turned to disappointment and suspicion when they discovered they could also not classify you as Elf or Half-Elf.  Despite their disappointment, the commune nursed you back to health.  Over the course of a few weeks your senses were gradually restored and your feral nature became recessive.  The commune was organized along traditional male and female roles which didn’t sit right with you, but it seemed to be a voluntary arrangement by both sexes so you swallowed what felt to you like an injustice in order to keep the peace.  Restless, eager to find clues to your past, and desiring to prove your worth; you volunteered for every patrol as soon as your mental and physical health were restored.     While the patrols did not lead you to any clues regarding your past, you did prove your worth to the commune and allayed most of their suspicions.  Month after month you patrolled and each month the patrols extended out further and further before they encountered signs of Orcs and Goblins.  In the year 6134, following months of patrols without a single encounter, the men of the commune voted and determined that it was time to leave the bog and resettle the fertile farm valleys to the north.You helped the commune organize, move, and found a farming community which they named Everdale.  Shortly after founding Everdale, the Human patrols encountered a community of Hobbits and regular trade commenced.  With trade, the Humans had their first taste of beer, a luxury they went without in the bog, in nearly 2000 years.  The men quickly determined that the women of the community should not be allowed to drink and just when you were about to approach the town elders to voice your concerns, you came across a man who was beating his wife in the streets.  It seems that he had been drunk the night before and had returned to his home where he demanded his wife honor her matrimonial obligations despite her protestations.  The next morning the husband was appalled to discover that his wife had entered her cycle.  It was forbidden in the community for women to share a bed with their husbands when they were menstruating.  The husband dragged his wife from the bed by her hair and was beating her in the streets as he continued to drag her to the town elders for judgment.  You interceded and beat the man into unconsciousness and then, in a moment of inspiration, you cut off his left nipple.  The town elders arrived too late to stop you, but just in time to witness the nipplotomy.  They dragged chairs into the street and with the townspeople gathering around they proceeded to immediately judge the matter.  It did not take them long to judge that your actions required punishment.  Owing to the considerable service that you had provided the community over the previous year, the elders decided that your punishment would be lightened.  Your punishment would be to have both right and left nipples removed followed by a period of indentured servitude to the man that you had assaulted.You glared back at the elders and at the townspeople.  You gave a stirring speech regarding the inequities within the community that you had witnessed.  At the end of the speech you stated that you did not accept the council's decree and instead declared your own judgment upon the community.  You declared that you would be the unseen protector of all women within the community from now until the end of time and that you would return to pass judgment on any man who so openly abused the women of the community.  With your closing words you threw the still bloody nipple onto the ground at the feet of the town elders.  The townspeople and elders looked around nervously.  With their eyes they pleaded with the fighting aged men of the community to do something with this woman who defied them.  But all of the fighting aged men of the community were they same men that you had patrolled with endlessly over the last year and it turns out they were more loyal to you than they were to the town elders.  You pushed your way through the crowd of townspeople, gathered your meager belongings, and left the town.  For a month you camped far from town and avoided all of the patrols.  At the end of the month you returned to town in the middle of the night.  You selected the home of one of the men from the village who was known for treating his wife and daughters poorly.  You snuck into his home, gagged him, and cut off his left nipple.  Not having been in town for the last month you did not know if he had abused his wife or daughters, but you knew it would be reasonable that everyone in town would believe that he had.  You knew this act would create terror in the minds of the men in town who would believe that you truly must be watching over the town and exacting vengeance as you saw fit. Despite the fact that you no longer remembered your past, these actions felt right to you.  Moreover, in recent months prior to the altercation in the streets, you had become aware of a spiritual presence in your life that not only guided you, but aided you with the supplement of some simple cantrips and other abilities.  The exact nature and identity of your deity remained as much of a mystery to you as your memories, but it is clear to you that your relationship with this higher power was longstanding.  Though your curiosity remains intact, you have also decided to give into your instincts which guide you through your daily devotions.  Your instincts provide you with something else.  While you cannot remember into your past, you possess an inward sense of foreboding regarding who you are, what you are, and your fate to come.  After leaving Everdale you decide it is time to search Middle Earth for the clues that will connect you with your past and your destiny.  During your extensive travels you appear to have the unconscious habit of encountering groups who are obsessed with prophesies.  These groups are generally very isolated and are cultist in nature; regarding the prophecy itself as a thing to worship.  The Taarakian Promise, Philmore’s Prophecy, The Quaranian Codices, The Prophesies of Eiselfane are just a few of the bizarre prophesies that you have encountered.  The Taarakian Promise was a fanatically held belief by a small city in the mountains that their city was protected by a single warrior called The Taarakian.  You never saw any evidence of this warrior, but the city did appear to have survived the preceding Age of Chaos unscathed so perhaps there was something to it.  Philmore’s Prophecy was kept by a small band of humans hidden away in a mountain valley who believed that a Savior would one day return to “undo what had been done”.  A blind sculptor was at work carving The Savior into stone on the side of a mountain, presumably by divine inspiration.  It did not yet possess any recognizable features when you last saw it several hundred years ago as most of the work accomplished by that time was clearing the surrounding land and preparing the rock surface.  They people of the valley believed they were cursed and that The Savior would lift the curse from the valley.  Many strange events occurred while you visited the valley and you did not doubt that there appeared to be some curse upon these people.  However, you did not see how you could help them and eventually you wished them luck and travelled out of the valley.  The Quaranian Codices dealt with a series of manuscripts that described how The Lost God would either be freed from her underground prison, or would have her soul destroyed forever depending upon the exact sequencing of events during a prescribed ritual.  The Quaranian Codices also described where the Lost God would be found.  Humans and Gnomes worked side by side exploring a vast network of underground caverns in search of the Lost God and you spent many weeks in those caverns as well assisting them before you determined that it was time to move on.  The Prophecies of Eiselfane are a series of seemingly unrelated and bizarre rantings of an insane Beholder who the men of Trillingham discovered and captured in the forests near their village.  Completely overcome by insanity, the Beholder was incapable of mounting any resistance and was easily captured by the humans who brought it back to Trillingham as a totem or as “counting coup”.  Eventually the villagers began to believe that the Beholder which they had named Eiselfane possessed prophetic powers and began to record his bizarre rantings.  These recollections are merely the most interesting of encounters with prophesy mad Demihumans as you recall encountering many more than described above.  You never stayed in these communities long and it is difficult to recall specific details regarding the many groups and prophecies you encountered.Throughout the hundreds of years that you have travelled Middle Earth you have found scant clues to your past.  Your only lead seems to be that your identity is occasionally mistaken for a man who shares similar features and temperament to yours.  His trail has led you to a small town in the north called New Breverik.  This man has not been seen in New Breverik, but the trail of sightings that you have followed indicate that he may be in this region.  You have decided to base yourself out of New Breverik while you wait for word from the many contacts you have developed in surrounding communities.While waiting to hear word, you have had some friendly banter with a group of budding adventurers who have gathered in New Breverik.  You have always had trouble relating to normal humans and other demihumans who do not possess the mentality of a fighter.  You find that there is a certain purity and purpose in patrolling uncivilized lands, meeting the monstrous, passing judgment, and delivering justice all in one short episode and that only fellow fighters can truly understand this purity and purpose.One other curious detail likely connects you to your past. From 33 June through 3 July each year and when bathed in the full moon as always appears on those dates, you can make out the faint traces of a strange symbol that appears on the palm of your dominant hand.  While you are an open book about much of the past that you remember, something tells you that this symbol is deeply personal and private.  You have not shared its existence with anyone."3/28/2018 21:45:43,Torvald,Dwarf,Cleric,"Torvald Son of Tormond son of Tharmond, of the Doomhammer clan, from the citadel of Hammerheim, known as Torvald Doomhammer in the lands of Men.Personality: Torvald is young and optimistic, and convinced that with Thor’s might, all things are possible. He loves books and learning, and thinks people who don’t read are probably idiots. He’s a child of wealth, ignorant of his privilege, which makes him  Background: Scholar’s ApprenticeAs the apprentice and assistant of a dedicated scholar, Torvald has spent years painstakingly copying ancient manuscripts and translating tales written in dead languages, sorting out forgeries from real antiques, and piecing together stories by weaving together disparate fragments found across many documents. He is at home in a library, surrounded by books. He loves learning new things and sharing what he learns, and has a knack for remembering odd bits of information. Sometimes it’s even useful. Skill proficiencies: History, InvestigationFeature: Possibly Relevant InformationTorvald has read many, many books. There’s a very good chance that he’s run across something like whatever he’s dealing with in one of them. It might even be true! BackstoryAs a child, Torvald intended to follow in his father’s footsteps as a brewmaster, but found his calling in the worship of Thor as a warrior priest. For the past 15 years, Torvald has served Halfdan son of Hallbjorn son of Halvor, of the Runeaxe clan, a senior cleric of Thor, first as an apprentice and then as an assistant. Halfdan is an exacting master, but Torvald has thrived under his tutelage, learning to fight and to work through Thor’s grace in the casting of spells. Torvald’s master, Halfdan RuneaxeHalfdan was known in his younger days as a skilled warrior and cleric. As he has aged, he has become obsessed with the collection and study of writings from past ages. At times he seems possessed going days ignoring all things but his various collections of writings; reading, compiling notes, and dispatching letters across all of Middle Earth in search of more. He is regarded highly for his knowledge and is often sought out for his expertise in ancient scripts and the information they contain. Two years ago, Halfdan was asked to represent Hammerheim on New Breverik’s Vigilance Committee, the counterpart to Hammerheim’s War Council, a position of great honor and prestige. Together, the Vigilance Committee and the War Council oversee the defense and peacekeeping efforts throughout the valley, organizing patrols, staffing and maintaining defensive works and sentry posts. Halfdan has taken up residence in New Breverik in a small but sturdily constructed and comfortable house in the Noble’s Quarter of New Breverik, near to the Temple of Thor, where he and Torvald assist in services with the high priest, Olaf Doomhammer, a second cousin (once removed) of Torvald. HammerheimIt is the year 6133. Torvald was born in the year 6078 in the glorious Dwarven citadel of Hammerheim. He is of the Doomhammer clan, which has ruled Hammerheim since its founding by Bartel Doomhammer in 2276 CR during the Third Age of Chaos, almost 4000 years ago. The sappers and warriors of Hammerheim played a key role in Third Ragnarok, tunneling underneath the Goblin fortress of Urthag and rising from its depths to slay the Underking Gothmog and deprive Sauron of key allies. In the Fourth Age of Men, Hammerheim gained fame for its fine beers, due in part to the citadel’s long relationship with the Humans of Breverik, who supplied hops and barley. Today, in addition to the Doomhammer clan, Hammerheim is home to the Runeaxe, Stonebreaker, Steeldriver, Deepminer and Goblinslayer clans. Dwarves of the Stonebreaker, Steeldriver and Deepminer clans are most often builders, smiths and miners, while the Runeaxe and Goblinslayer clans provide warriors. During the Fourth Age of Chaos, with the valley overrun by monsters and fiends, the Humans of Breverik were encircled with no chance for escape or retreat and faced certain death. The Dwarves of Hammerheim worked quickly to save the Humans, carving tunnels from their citadel underneath the town. Then the Dwarves marched from Hammerheim toward the western flank of the forces of chaos, creating a diversion which allowed the Humans of Breverik to escape into the tunnels and to the citadel.The Humans of Breverik spent the entire Fourth Age of Chaos in Hammerheim. At first the Humans were regarded by many Dwarves as interlopers and freeloaders; however, the Humans proved to be capable fighters and loyal allies and soon won over the stony hearts of their dwarven hosts. After nearly 2000 years of shared isolation within the citadel, there was not a single element of dwarf and human culture that was not shared. They spoke each other’s languages, shared gods and values, and took each other as apprentices to train in artisanship. New BreverikIn the year 5785, with the dawning of the Fourth Age of Man, many Humans and quite a few Dwarves left Hammerheim to return to the valley, founding New Breverik just across the river from the ruins of Breverik. The Heimers and the Brekkers, as the two groups call one another, are close, and while they are fond of teasing each other regarding their cultural idiosyncrasies, they quickly unite against outsiders who show disrespect for either culture. As a sign of continuing gratitude, the Humans of New Breverik throw a feast after the fall harvest each year for the Dwarves of Hammerheim. At the third annual feast, the Dwarves reciprocated by bringing gifts from their artisans for the New Breverik Humans. It is an annual event that both Humans and Dwarves look forward to and has become known as Thanksgiving. Today, as in the past, the Humans in the valley provide two valuable services for the Dwarven citadel. New Breverik’s position on the river makes it an excellent trading post, where the wares created by Dwarven artisans are shipped and sold throughout the surrounding lands. In addition, the city and the fertile farms of the valley provide a steady source of food, including the golden hops and barley that make Hammerheim’s famous beers so well-regarded. "3/28/2018 21:46:52,Anlyth,Elf,Ranger,"Anlyth (Vaniion)It is the year 6133.  Vaniion was born in the year 6101 in the royal halls of the Silvan Kingdom of Mirkwood.  Vaniion is a direct descendant of Oropher, Thranduil, and Legolas.  The wood elves of Mirkwood are held in high regard throughout Middle Earth for their role in defeating Sauron at the end of the Third Age of Mankind.Vaniion is the son of the Silvan King, Belwarthien, and Queen, Siohnen.  The Queen passed in the year 6128.  The Funeral was well attended by all the leadership of Middle Earth.  While she was a beloved Queen, it did not stifle the closely held rumors among those nearest the crown who whispered that Belwarthien was not the father of Vaniion.  Discrete and noble, the Elves of Mirkwood never discussed their suspicions in the direct presence of Vaniion, yet he is aware of the rumors. Vaniion has one older brother and a younger brother and sister.  The older brother disappeared under mysterious circumstances.  The younger siblings are twins. Lyestan is the eldest of the four siblings.  Born in the year 6097 He went missing from the kingdom in the year 6105 with his Akh Mathor.  An Akh Mathor is an Elf that is assigned to both protect and guide children of royal birth until they reach an appropriate age, generally considered around 50.  The Silvan Elves searched Mirkwood for close to 2 years without uncovering a single clue regarding Lyestan’s fate, which seemed as odd to the King and Queen as his disappearance.  Both the King and the Queen, despite the mysteriousness of Lyestan’s disappearance, have never given up hope that he will one day return.  At every meal a place setting is set in wait of Lyestan’s return.    While Vaniion does not have many memories of his older brother, the ones he retains are strong.  In these memories Vaniion remembers Lyestan as a loving older brother who included Vaniion on all of his childhood adventures.  Vaniion was heartbroken when his brother disappeared.  Lierin is Vaniion’s younger sister and his favorite sibling.  Bercareth is her twin brother.  As twins they are very close to one another and do everything as a team.  Lierin and Bercareth were born in the year 6115.  Lierin is arranged to be married to the heir apparent of the Lothlórien Kingdom in the year 6215 after they both have achieved an appropriate age and the opportunity to know each other.  Lierin finds the Lothlórien Elves a bit vain and proud and she has not yet noted any endearing qualities in her betrothed, but she admits that she is young and that there is time.  She will depart Mirkwood in 6135 to spend a few decades with the Lothlórien Elves.  Both the Lothlórien and Mirkwood Elves are looking forward to the wedding and the promise for better relations between the two Kingdoms that it portends.  Bercareth admits that he will be devastated when Lierin leaves the Kingdom.Yaladasnin is Vaniion’s Akh Mathor and has been his constant companion since birth.  Yaladasnin has been present for every major event in Vaniion’s life.  Yaladasnin taught Vaniion his first letters and how to wield his first sword and fire his first arrow.  There is an intrinsic trust between the two.At the age of 22, Vaniion was placed in charge of one of the kingdom’s patrols.  Vaniion loved patrolling Mirkwood and the surrounding lands and mountains.  He was a natural leader and his men and women of his patrol loved him. In the year 6130, Belwarthien left the Kingdom of Mirkwood for Valinor in search of clues related to The Mercenary’s Creed, a prophesy that he had become obsessed with.  In Vaniion’s youth his teachers and his Akh Mathor taught him many prophesies.  The Pylotic Prophesy, The Mrin Codex, The Mercenary’s Creed, and the Prophesy of the Lost Gods are just a few that he learned.  Belwarthien always stressed the importance of knowing prophesy and Vaniion knows many older Elves who regard certain prophecies very highly so it was not a complete shock to you when your father decided to depart on a journey in search of prophetic meaning.  Vaniion remembers bits and pieces of prophecy, but put most of that learning behind him after he started patrolling.  Vaniion knows that only the rich and royalty spend any serious time studying prophecies.With only 32 years of experience behind him, Vaniion was placed in charge of the kingdom with his Akh Mathor assigned as ghost regent.  Running the kingdom was never Vaniion’s aspiration and he did not enjoy it.  He was much more at home searching the Mirkwood or the neighboring mountains or plains.  After two years of enduring the privation and misfortune associated with ruling, and secretly plagued by thoughts that his rule might be considered illegitimate, Vaniion gathered his younger siblings and told them he was leaving the kingdom.  Lierin and Bercareth argued that this was not allowed as  Lierin had obligations to Lothlórien and Bercareth was considered too young, even with his Akh Mathor as ghost regent, to rule the Kingdom.  Vaniion, they argued, could not avoid his responsibilities.  Young and impulsive, Vaniion in company with his Akh Mathor left the Kingdom in secret shortly thereafter.    Knowing that his siblings will search for him and that they will send word throughout the known kingdoms, Vaniion dropped his family name and travels under the name of Anlyth.  Vaniion avoids discussing his past.  Yaladasnin although not completely behind Vaniion’s decision to leave the kingdom, cannot act in any other fashion than to support Vaniion’s chosen path and he has taken the name of Ayas while living outside the kingdom.After a year of constant travel Vaniion (Anlyth) finds himself on the outskirts of civilization in the town of New Breverik.  He and Yaladasnin (Ayas) decide that a short rest is in order before moving onward."3/28/2018 21:47:52,Lars,Elf,Rogue,"Lars GreentreeIt is the year 6133.  Lars Greentree was born in the year 6095 to Elgalin Greentree and Theran Greentree.  Elgalin, your mother was a Half-Elf and Theran, your father was an Elf.  Both Mom and Dad were distantly related to the Wood Elves of Mirkwood, but are descended from a long line of adventurers who left the Kingdom of Mirkwood early on during the Fourth Age of Chaos.  Both Elgalin  and Theran  were children born near the transition between the Fourth age of Chaos and the Fourth Age of Mankind and were more comfortable living a life of uncertainty that was common during the time of their births than they were in the confines of civilization.  Elgalin and Theran, in keeping with their recent ancestry, were adventurers in a small but modestly successful adventuring party. In the year 6105, Elgalin and Theran Greentree departed with an adventuring group to the ruins of Imrryr, once known as The Dreaming City.  It was a campaign that had been years in the planning as the dangers of Dragon Isle were well documented.  While the risks were high, the rewards promised to be equally so; the adventuring party had been to the outskirts of Dragon Isle several times and had never been disappointed.  The adventuring party never returned.  While he has fond memories of both parents, Lars remembers his mother the best as she was sometimes left behind while his father adventured to support the family.  Elgalin was a caring mother and a good teacher.  In their home on the outskirts of the port city of Bergen she taught him the languages of the Dwarves, Gnomes, and Halflings which she learned in her youth along with the language of Orcs and the peculiar dialect of the Drow which she learned during her adventuring years.  She was also fond of regaling Lars with tales of adventuring.On the eve of their departure for the ruins of Imrryr, Elgalin  and Theran travelled into Bergen and left Lars with Svavar Gardarson, a human and distant cousin on Elgalin’s side of the family.  Svavar was more than just a distant relation, he was also a close family friend who had helped Elgalin  and Theran on numerous occasions.Lars’ last memory of his mother was her attaching an amulet around his neck and making him promise that he would never remove it.  Elgalin claimed that it was magical and would help protect him while she and Theran were away.  She warned him that the amulet would now be specially linked with Lars, but that the link would be broken and it’s magic would fail if the amulet was ever removed.  Lars has never removed the amulet.  At times Lars wonders if his mother had kept the amulet for herself then maybe she would have survived.      At first, Svavar acted as Lars’s protector and continued his education and raised him as he felt that Elgalin  and Theran would have desired.  However, as the years wore on and it became apparent that Elgalin  and Theran would never return, Svavar began to treat Lars as his own son and raised him in that fashion.  It was not long thereafter that Svavar took Lars into his confidence and showed him a whole new world.  Svavar is the head of a vast network of thieves and assassins throughout all of Middle Earth called “The Organization”.  Not every thief and assassin in Middle Earth belongs to the organization, but many do.  Those that do not belong to The Organization typically deal in small petty crime and are seldom organized in anything larger than a street gang.  Thieves and assassins who aspire to greater crimes or who become organized at a higher level are generally approached by The Organization and made an offer that they cannot refuse.The Organization exists on two levels.  The outer ring is a network of smuggling, extortion, and similar higher level crimes which require a level of sophistication and organization beyond that of a mere street gang.  Those that belong to the outer ring work on the shadowy fringes of society and, while the existence of The Organization is difficult to conceal in entirety, they nevertheless go through great pains to eliminate all evidence that points definitively to its existence.  Thieves and assassins take blood oaths and frequently risk themselves personally in order to maintain the secrets of The Organization.  Despite these efforts and despite the lack of any direct evidence to its existence, rumors of The Organization and its alleged activities are common throughout Middle Earth.The inner ring of The Organization is a group within the group.  The inner ring does not deal in the affairs of organized crime for profit.  The work of the inner ring is that of statecraft; corrupting bureaucracies, stealing state secrets, blackmail and extortion at the state level, kidnappings of high officials, and assassinations of those who are supposed to be impossible to assassinate.  The inner ring works to obtain political power and leverage in order to advance the interests of The Organization.  While operatives in the outer ring sometimes act unknowingly to carry out the interests of the inner ring, only those thieves and assassins that are part of the inner ring know of its existence.     Svavar runs a legitimate shipping company in Bergen which allows him to launder money and also provides him the necessary excuses when he finds it necessary to travel on behalf of The Organization.  Most of his employees have no idea that they are working as part of a front for The Organization.  At the same time that Svavar was apprenticing Lars through The Organization, he was also apprenticing Lars through his legitimate shipping company in order to provide Lars with an adequate cover for his travels and entanglements.  Lars has worked as a longshoreman, foreman, dock supervisor, and warehouse manager.  While the initial years when the exact nature of their relationship was being forged were difficult for both Lars and Svavar, Svavar has proven to be a worthy adoptive father to Lars and it is plain to both those inside and outside The Organization that he cares for Lars deeply.  Svavar his striven to provide Lars with every advantage.  Svavar was widowed before taking Lars in and has never bothered to remarry.  Without any other children to his name and fast approaching the age of 80, he has made it clear to both the outer and inner rings that Lars will be his successor.  Lars, for his part, is well respected both within and without The Organization for his shrewdness and is seen as a worthy heir to both the legitimate and illegitimate dealings of his adopted father.Svavar does not see his activities as strictly criminal.  He understands that often times the activities that he is involved in are against the local laws or customs, but he is worldly enough to understand that the laws of mankind are often short sighted or poorly constructed and can vary greatly from region to region.  Svavar sees himself as an entrepreneur who is capitalizing on events and situations that would be capitalized upon by others if it were not for the simple fact that he was the first to act upon the opportunity.  Through his lens, Svavar neither sees his actions as good or as evil, he sees them simply as necessary.  Based upon this viewpoint, Svavar has a rather utilitarian philosophy to his organization’s activities.  Svavar does not act out of malice and is not willing to commit acts that will do great harm to others if they will only provide some limited good to The Organization.  He prefers what are generally considered as victimless crimes, although he is not opposed to doing harm to others when the amount of harm inflicted is considered small and the amount of gain that The Organization will receive is large. As Svavar has aged he has become more and more obsessed with a prophecy that was delivered to a distant ancestor and head of The Organization.  Lars never bothered much with prophecies as he was too concerned with the important business of the here and now to worry over such insubstantialities as prophecies suggest.  However, Lars could not fully avoid Svavar’s obsession and was at least aware that this particular prophecy was delivered by the Oracle of Pylos and that it described a time and circumstance when the “Kingdom within Kingdoms” would rule and guide Middle Earth through an age of chaos.  The Pylotic Prophecy is considered private family business and Lars is unaware of anyone beyond Svarvar who may have knowledge of its existence.   Svavar has confided in Lars that he believes that events are on the rise that will provide greater illumination regarding the Pylotic Prophecy and has directed Lars to proceed to the town of Breverik where you are to make contact with Fordin, an operative in the outer ring who acts as The Organization's eyes and ears in that region.  While Fordin is ignorant of the inner ring and the Pylotic Prophesy, he has delivered reports to Svavar that lead Svavar to believe that events are occurring in that region that were foretold in the prophecy.  Svavar believes these events are connected to the Temple of Thor and has directed Lars, his most trusted operative, to proceed to Breverik and to do his best to monitor the region and the temple along with Fordin.  Just prior to Lars’ departure, Svavar was a bit emotional regarding Lars leaving.  In an exceptionally warm and tender moment while Svavar was personally outfitting Lars for his journey, Svavar shared with him the following sentiment.  “In the past I have shielded you from certain truths regarding my past.  It is unlikely as you go out into the world that I will be able to continue to shield you from these truths.  I would share these truths with you now if I knew a path to do so.  But I do not.  Please know, Lars, that whatever you may learn about me regarding my past that it changes nothing with respect to us.  I have and will always love you like a son.”  Lars thought this was an odd thing for Svavar to say as there was nothing imaginable to Lars that would change the way he feels toward his adopted father.  Lars chalked it up to simple nerves and provided Svavar the typical reassurances that such a situation would warrant. Lars backstory for the good people of Breverik is that he has a desire to follow in the footsteps of his late mother and father and to try his skills at adventuring."3/29/2018 3:14:17,ikkix,elf,rogue,3/29/2018 3:22:52,Devona Ashlander,Tiefling,Bard,"Devona and her twin sister Senra are the last daughters of the noble Ashlander house.  Their family's shipping fleet once boasted a hundred ships who made berth in the harbors of the capital when they weren't transporting goods between the nation's many islands.  The wealth they earned from this business bought the Ashlanders nobility and renown, and for generations they wanted for nothing.  Over time, however, as the political climate of the islands grew more severe, their business began to wane.  The Ashlanders refused to employ slave labor or slash the modest wages of their crews.  Inevitably, other traders unconcerned with taking on such practices made much greater profits, and attracted the patronage of those who shared their views on how the common people should be treated.  By the time Devona and Senra were born, the nobility of their blood existed in name alone.  The sisters spent many of their childhood hours playing within the vacant, cobwebbed corridors of the once opulent Ashlander manor.  Day by day, the borders within which they were allowed to roam grew ever smaller as more rooms and halls crumbled into dangerous disrepair.Eventually, the abandoned wings of the house grew too unsafe to continue exploring, and the sisters grew old enough to adopt more intricate hobbies - Devona taking up violin, which her sister accompanied with dancing.  The two remained one another's sole source of companionship... at least until the day that Senra's acrobatic skills caught the interest of a wealthy benefactor from outside the Capital, who offered to enroll her in a private academy where she could further hone the art of her performance free of charge.  The last time the twins saw eachother they were eight years old.  Devona would have been lying to say that she wasn't somewhat jealous - why were Senra's talents so much more impressive than her own? - but mostly she just missed her sister.  She spent much of the lonely years that followed perfecting her musical abilities and listening to her grandparents' stories.  The tales they told were of Ashlander manor during its days of glittering grandeur... of Mol'Darin before tyranny spoiled it... of their own youths spent out on the sea.Three weeks after the marking of Devona's thirteenth year her grandmother succumbed to a wasting illness she'd been battling with for some time.  Four months later, her brokenhearted grandfather followed her to the grave... and before the years' close, the letter arrived - a terrible accident, no body to bury, Senra - dead.A part of Devona never believed it - a twin just knew... but her parents put little stock in that superstition.  They mourned, they interred an empty casket in the family mausoleum next to those of their own parents, and the manorhouse grew silent.  But Devona had been inspired - both by the glimpses her grandparents' tales had given her to the life of splendor their family once enjoyed - and the power which the very words they'd spoken held... and by the mysterious fate of her twin sister.  Devona realized she didn't even know where the school Senra had been taken to was located... but she knew she would not find out - or find Senra - if she merely idled in their wasting mansion.It took little effort for Devona to convince her parents to allow her to accompany them on their voyages at sea.  Though her parents doubted their business would last to see their child take command of it, they were still eager to keep their daughter close by.  Initially Devona merely observed while they bartered and traded, but she was always eager to deepen her involvement, and soon proved to possess a natural charm and way with words.  She picked up the skills of shiphandling quickly, and used her free time during the long voyages to continue to practice her music, and, on occasion, entertain and inspire the crew with the same stories she'd grown up with.  Over the next seven years she made no progress toward the goal of discovering her sister's whereabouts, especially given that her attempts to seek information about this mysterious school and the man who ran it had to be done in secrecy so as not to upset her parents.  Instead, she made many friends among the sailors who'd remained loyal to her family.  She learned their songs, and acquainted herself with the ways of the common people from which she'd lived most her life in seperation.  It was during this period that she met and grew close to fellow Tiefling and captain in the Ashlanders' fleet Fatua Chaylum, coming to view her as a role model to look up to, and even a surrogate family member, especially after the loss of so many others.  When Devona was 20, the ship she and her parents were sailing on went down in a storm.  She washed up on a small island nearby, but there was no sign of her parents, the ship, or its crew.  It took her some time to recover from the incident, and longer still to make her way back to the capital.  When she arrived, she found that her home and her family's belongings had been seized by the nobles who had once been her neighbors.  Devona was furious and desperate to take back what was hers, but Fatua intervened.  Now that there were no Ashlanders left to ask questions, she was sure that Devona's claim on the property would prove no great obstacle to anyone currently helping themselves to her birthright.With Fatua, and a handful of other sailors behind her, Devona boarded her family's private vessel - The Midnight Star, a small pleasure craft unsuitable for carrying full shipments of goods - and sailed it out of its hidden mooring beneath Ashlander manor under cover of darkness.  Watching the lights of the great city sink into the sea behind, she vowed to restore her family’s wealth and honor by whatever means necessary.  Devona spent the next several years freelancing, taking any job that paid enough to profit - chauffeuring diplomats between cities, working as a courier for smaller loads of goods, even smuggling, and 'intercepting' other shipments if contracted to do so at a high enough price.  Not wanting to tarnish her family's name with the more sordid affairs she engaged in, Devona continued all further oceanborn adventuring under the alias of 'Captain Ash', though in situations where a different approach would be more advantageous, she sheds this persona and presents herself as the mild-mannered 'Lady Devona' instead.She still searches for her sister... but with nearly two decades gone since last they met, her hope is running thin."3/29/2018 3:23:31,Wakachaka,Goblin,Monk,"Wakachaka's story begins with her swarm as they were raiding a country town - a normal activity for them to do on slow Sunday nights. After slaying the last peasant, they retired to the local tavern to revel in their looting. As the celebration wore on, Wakachaka got up on a table and started taking bets on how much ale she could drink and still remain standing.?Wakachaka doesn't remember whether she won any bets, but she assumes that she did not... She awoke the next day (maybe?) under a collapsed bed in a back room. It was a trick getting out, and once she did she found the tavern, and the whole town, abandoned. Apparently, buried under shards of wood and chunky blankets, the swarm had given up trying to find her, left her behind, and moved on... or perhaps they'd just been too hung over to realize she was even missing.?Having never been very good with directions, rather than try to find her way back, Wakachaka decided to make this town her new home. It certainly smelled better than the old den anyway, at least once she got done burning the bodies. The pantries were well-stocked and the tavern was still full of ale, and for two weeks Wakachaka lived in greater luxury than most gerblins ever know... until the visitors came... ?Luckily, it was an openminded band of adventurers (or at least not especially intelligent ones) who first arrived at her door. They thought nothing of the empty town, the wrecked tavern, or the fact that it had a gerblin for a barkeep. Wakachaka, dumbfounded by their sudden arrival, was halfway through pondering how best to slit their throats and take their coin when they just... gave it to her... in exchange for rooms and drinks. ?The next day the adventurers moved on... but they were back within the week, spending freely from the spoils of their expedition. In fact, they were so charmed by Wakachaka's somewhat vicious brand of hospitality that they promised to make her tavern a regular stop in their travels. By their next arrival Wakachaka had even managed to sweep up a bit.?This continued for a time, and before long other travelers began to filter in, brought by chance or by word of mouth from others who had sung her praises. Before she knew it, Wakachaka had a bustling business - which she named The Broken Bunk after the intoxicated accident that had ultimately led to her inheriting it. Even the empty village surrounding it was starting to attract new settlers to its conveniently vacant housing. Evidently assuming that she was the landlord, farmers and merchants started buying the land from Wakachaka and making themselves at home.?By this time, however, the ale supply was running dangerously low... but Wakachaka wasn't worried. Down in the caverns of her old den she'd been quite the accomplished poisonmaker, and she was certain she could apply those same skills to brewing. ?It took... a few attempts... and a few houses winding up mysteriously empty again when her patrons sampled from those early failed batches, but Wakachaka eventually found a method that worked, and the ale flowed freely from her tavern once more. For years to follow, Wakachaka diligently perfected her craft and expanded her menu. Her brews won awards and even gained her membership in the kingdom's renowned brewer's guild. Wakachaka became so elated with her string of successes that she began celebrating them with the same raucous fervor that she had the original raid on the town.?After one incident during which she all but emptied her whole stock herself, Wakachaka fell into an drunken stupor so deep that she slept three straight days, and during that extended unconsciousness, she received a revelation... Wakachaka woke up to find she'd been bestowed secret knowledge and power straight from the drink itself. The next day, without a word of warning to her customers, her employees, or her many taxpayers, she packed away her brewing equipment, emptied the remaining kegs in her storeroom, locked up the Broken Bunk, and disappeared.?Since then, Wakachaka has lived on the road, taking up a life of adventure like those first guests to come to her humble inn. She wanders the world in pursuit of a most profound quest - to assemble the perfect combination of ingredients needed to brew a beverage of the most sublime taste and highest potency... at which point, for her noble efforts, Wakachaka believes she will ascend to achieve a higher state of being. Along the way she intends to seek out and sample all manner of alchohols of exotic origin to help further hone her palatte for this monumental task.

Slave of house Arvu, probably originally from some rural tribe or another that one of the merchant caravans happened across. I'm thinking Grandwater took him, and then sold him off to Arvu when they got back to Khemi. Probably one of his parents sold him off, maybe because being a half-breed was shameful to them, but if it works better that he was just taken that's a good hook too.Quickly learned that words and subtle action had more power than violence. He was probably a bit of a bully at first, until someone taught him that lesson. Fast forward a ten-year or so and he's talked his way in the the personal service of one of Leopold Arvu's wives. Would put on shows, tell stories, go out and steal small trinkets for her, etc. I imagine it's not uncommon for both male and female high ranking merchants to keep consorts, but when Leopold found out about it (being a jealous type) he gave Cal over to the researchers of house Arvu who were looking to improve upon the design of their glyph of protection. Unfortunately this process has many trials and errors along the way... and Leopold was counting on an error. Cal was given a modified Glyph (mechanically maybe no protection as it was a total failure, or maybe just on par with a normal glyph at lvl 1 protection) and subjected to a Demon... who possessed him. In true quick talking Huckster fashion though, he struck a deal for their lives (they would kill him and the demon both after all). Leave Cal in control for now, lend him some power, and he would get them out.This process took place in a remote research facility of the Arvu, in a village secretly under their control. The place had a very Area 51 vibe in the cultural lore of the area, with more than the normal rumors circulating, sightings of monsters, villagers gone missing in the night, etc. The whole village is run through with a network of underground tunnels, and there are lots houses with fake doors and no occupants, used as fronts for the research labs and having their only points of ingress and egress as these tunnels. They had more food and fine inks being imported than the populace could possibly use (secretly needed for the researchers and slaves). Cal survived his ordeal, appearing not to have been possessed, and was kept on as a slave for further study and, he suspected, eventual dissection at Leopold’s request. So, Cal and the Devil set a plan into motion, leaking little tidbits to the villagers of the sizeable shipments being snuck in to the facilities at night. One evening raiders attacked the village, responding to the rumors of great wealth flooding in, and Cal took his chance. In a gambit he hoped would look to his masters like he was trying to protect their interests, he approached the raiders alone. He was feeling confident that he could talk his way into their good graces and in so doing make his escape… but he miscalculated. He was beaten within an inch of his life, tied in to a sack, and thrown into river. By a true stroke of luck, a war-tattered man (Chris’ character) saw this turn of events and plucked him from his watery grave. Mr. Noname brought Cal back to health over the coming weeks, but then snuck off with nary a word. A strange turn of events, to be so indebted to a stranger and have them ask for nothing in return. At least now the Arvu would take him for dead…. If he could just find a way to remove the slave mark he might be able to keep them in the dark for a while longer..."3/29/2018 10:51:36,Arjhan Ironbeard,Dragonborn,Paladin,"A dwarven paladin slew a mighty dragon, which released a magical burst when it died.

Many there do not worship and are prone to logic based thinking, but there is still a strong religious secret within the People of the Sand. As an apprentice, Niershka began to study mechanical contraptions. She soon became adept in tinkering, fixing, and inventing. Once her mentor passed, she took over his shop and has expanded the business. While her shop in the desert is her main business, she also occasionally opens pop ups with mechanical wonders. Despite her mentor's good heart and kindness for others, Niershka does not harbor said trait. She explores the world soley to make a profit and lies and steals her way to fame. What's important to her is to make a name for herself and gather riches to strengthen her shop and mechanical research. She is manipulative and sneaks her way through situation. No one ever expects such trickey from a small halfling female, and she's full aware of that. She is not wicked, but rather very selfish and focused on what's good for her.

As the second child in her family, her brother was to take his place as the head of the temple once their mother chose to step down, while N’talhi was allowed to travel more freely. The local lord of their city, Lord Cavannaugh, was a very religious man and encouraged his family to regularly attend worship on the holy days of the Unknown. His youngest daughter, Kalina, was often in attendance. Kalina and N’talhi soon became fast friends, and then infatuated with each other. Together they schemed up a political pact that would ensure they could live together without any “family duties” preventing them from being together. They proposed a “political marriage” that really had little to do with politics and more to do with love. Their parents allowed this, and chose to view it as a political union between the heads of state and the head of religion in their region. One day, Kalina had been acting strangely, and had stopped attending worship at the temple of the Unknown. After about a week N’talhi, being of a stubborn sort, tracked her down and realized that not all was what it seemed. Through her connection with the unknown it became clear that Kalina had been killed, her corpse reanimated, and was being used by mecromancers to disrupt the political situation. In tears she struck down the creature that was once her fiancée, and carefully brought her body to the temple.

She offered up a deal to the Unknown- eradicate the sect of mecromancers spitting in the face of their religion, and she would be granted her love back. Whole and unharmed. The Unknown accepted, and N’talhi now roams throughout the world, searching for whispers of the black sect, and making sure that no others fall to the same fate as she.

The majority of our interaction with the world beyond was via trading boats with the nearby city. I would spend hours with my best friend Kaolan looking at the strange wares that the traders brought. Otherwise we’d be playing in the trees when we were younger or causing mayhem in and around the taverns as we got older – we we’re practically inseparable.One evening, after a few too many tankards of sour wine, Kaolan and I were huddled in the corner of the tavern listening to Bong-Eyed Balthezar the Untrustworthy (he’d never done anything to make him untrustworthy, there was just an old folk tale about being suspicious of people who don’t look straight at you when they’re talking to you) play a lute and sing of distant lands. I still only vaguely remember professing some level of love to be able to move a crowd as the music was moving me that night but the next morning Kaolan bought me my own lute from the trading boats and I couldn’t be happier! From then I spent countless evenings creating melodies and singing about the legends of our islands with Kaolan by my side, either helping with the lyrics or lamping anyone who got a bit too close and touchy-feely whilst I was performing (closer than I’d normally consider tolerable, that is). I couldn’t have been happier than I was those years. And then Kaolan was gone.His parents had important connections with the trading guild in the city and so he was sent away as part of an arranged marriage to secure a “financially beneficial future” they told me in a rather matter of fact way. Everything on the islands felt cold and unwelcoming. Even when the autumnal bonfires blazed high into the night sky and families would come together, laughing and joking, I felt lost. Turning to rotten mead and wine wouldn’t bring Kaolan back but it was certainly preferable to clarity. It was during an eve of drinking that Balthezar was weaving tales of travelling musicians – dwarves, halflings and the like who traveled the country, living a nomadic lifestyle with the their instruments, each other and nothing more.Early the following morning, as the hangover wore off and I could see in colour again, I packed up my possessions, got onto one of the trading boats, left The Evermoors for the first time in my life and never looked back."3/29/2018 13:35:35,Alisya,Half-orc,Cleric,"Alisya was the daughter of the vicious Orc warlord Ugric and the farmer's wife Annisya.

Well whether you are asking or not, too bad, I’m going to tell you anyways. Our tale begins in the magical land of Aenora. Well… only sort-of magical. Obviously there are wizards and shite, but that is beside the point. 20 years ago to the day this tale was wrote, a young boy by the name of Memely Pepeartly. Not a day over the age of 5 he was, the skipper young lad. His mother, a Halfling Bardess locally known as “The Iron Maiden” for her sick luting skills, raised her son lovingly, teaching him the small things about music that he would eventually grow to love.Upon the young halfing’s 5th birthday, his mother decidedly took him to a travelling fair, of sorts, complete with run magic, rides, and the many animals of the realm. The day couldn’t had been more perfect. The two were bonding as best a mother and her son could, and even a blind-man could see the love they had for each other. That all changed however, when one the pair decided to visit one of the animals on display to pet and play with. It all happened in a fun exhibit of the fair, for what could be considered the petting zoo of the event. Many sorts of small and exotic creatures were on display for the young ones to play with and pet. Nothing hostile or dangerous of the sort. Memely, curious of a rather large bird out on display with a large sign reading “Deep Goose”, cautiously walked forward to make friends with the animal. His mother, unaware what was going on, as she too, was interested at some of the cute animals, was unaware that her small, halfing child, holding his ice-cream happily in his hands, was venturing further and further into the exhibit in pursuit of the Goose. Eventually, far out of earshot of Memely’s mother, the Goose noticed the food that he had in his small hands. The Goose, concerned with nothing else but the food, attempted to take it from the small child, but only proceeded to pick up the boy entirely, and, scared at the mass now kicking and crying, proceeded to fly and jump over the crowds, over the fence enclosing the place, and, with Memely in tow, out into the woods, far away from his mother. Kicking and screaming, trying to get the Goose to release him, eventually, it let him go, and,seeking its reward, plucked the treat from the halfing’s small hand, and leaving him there; alone and crying in the woods without a mother, and no signs of any onlookers or rescue. Days went by, as Memely waited for help, finding shelter in trees, and calling out to anyone who would be able to hear him, but to no avail. Each day, he wandered out a little bit further in the hopes of finding someone… anyone; but each day he unknowingly became just a little bit more lost. One day, the halfling happened upon a rather large lake uncharacteristically dominating the once forested landscape he had come to know the past weeks. Finding refuge in this new place, Memely sought shelter within a large, hollowed tree bordering the forest outside of the lake. It wasn’t until the next morning, upon waking up, that the small halfing realized that, even without blankets, or any means but his clothes to keep warm, he felt a friendly presence around him, and upon further inspection, found that he was surrounded by Ducks; many of them, all huddled around him and sleeping in a group. Perplexed that these birds had taken such a liking to him, he befriended them over the coming weeks, foraging for food, seeking shelter, and learning to swim.Weeks went by, and the halfing, now considering the group of Ducks his family, felt considerably less sad at the prospect of losing his mother. Each day, he became more and more distant from the life he once had, and closer to the one he shared with his family of Ducks. Eventually, he donned the name “Ducky”, and this being part of his new identity, he slowly began forgetting about his previous one each day. It wasn’t until the age of 10 that things would interrupt the perfect life he lived with his family of Ducks. He had only just woken up one day, when the most peculiar noises started emanating from a far edge of the lake. It was mystifying to him; after years of hardly any other human, or humanoid, rather, contact of any form, there sat a group of fellow halfings. 3 or 4 of them, all playing a rather calming tune with, what looked like to Ducky, bowls with sticks on the end, with spanning strings down the length of the contraption. He had never heard anything like it. It was a wonderful freeing feeling to hear the notes and harmonies that sailed through the air.Wanting to learn more about it all, and to get a better listen, he neared closer and closer to the halflings that would soon have a defining effect upon Ducky’s life. Upon further inspection of the group, they took notice of the small boy. It had been years since he had been missing, so unsurprisingly, he was not seen as the missing halfling boy from years prior. In fact, at first they simply laughed at the mannerisms of the child as he approached, dancing all the while, beaming all the while.Setting up camp for the night, the group noticed that the strange child, who, they had figured out, spoke very little common or halfling, had not returned to a family of other halflings they had originally presumed were accompanying him around the lake, but rather took refuge in a large and empty tree. Upon further investigation, they realized that this child seemed to not have a mother or father at all. It was not until the next day that, before leaving, they offered to take Ducky along with them. With the little language that he had retained from childhood, he was able to understand their proposition, and was delighted at the prospect of being with others who looked like him, and others who he had found great enjoyment in the way they played their strange instruments. He told his family of ducks his farewells with the small gestures he had picked up as a child to communicate with them, and was off into the world with this strange band of strangers who had seemed to take a liking to him.The group of travelling performers had quickly realized that Ducky had no family to call on. It had simply been too long, and the search had been long over, so adopting him into their group, they traveled together for many years. Fast-forward about 8, and in that time, Ducky had been taught how to speak fluently in the two languages he grew up with, being Halfling and Common, and learned how to play all sorts of instruments. Though he has very skilled at instruments like the pan-flute, and all sorts of drums, he always took a very particular liking to the Lute, especially.As Ducky was 18 now, he felt profoundly inspired to get a greater education in the music he had come to love from his lively band of misfits, and wanting to do them proud, he went off to Bard College to become just that, a Bard!During his time in Bard college, however, his adventures and discoveries were still in great supply. Ducky, who was keen with people and very apt to being in front of large crowds, had noticed that there was always a good number of people willing to make fun of drawings and picture, seemingly with sarcastic undertones about facts of life, or just jokes in general. He had always been able to steer awkward conversations into hilarious ones when he combined his jokes and conversation with relation to pictures or popular stories in the news. Wanting to know more about this phenomenon, he decidedly began studying up on social interaction of this kind alongside his studies as a bard. The school itself had not had a name for this type of study, so they allowed Ducky time to come up with a name for the minor education he had started.Looking for inspiration on what to call it, he headed out into the woods to play some music in solace. It was there that he had met a being that would inspire him to be the Halfling he is today. There, cautiously looking up at him was a frog; one slightly larger than the average frog, but with very bulbous eyes, and a face that could display emotions of many types. He quickly broke out his sketch pad, and very artfully sketched out the creature, speaking to it all the while. It never spoke back, but it always seemed to understand, and stayed very still, sometimes smiling at the jokes Ducky had put forth. As soon as Ducky had finished the drawing, however, the frog had vanished; nowhere to be found. Looking back down at his drawing, a word, previously uninvented came to him that Ducky believed would describe very well, the study he was in. One that would define a generation many thousands of yearsinto the future… Memes. Ducky had just made the world’s first Meme, to which he named “Pepe”, out of impression that the mystical frog had given him.And so, it was decided. Ducky, the little bard from the forest, was to be educated, and pave the way for studies in Memes. His teachers, all very perplexed, yet interested in his studies, found them to be quite insightful, seeing as the school itself was a school for the entertaining arts, and the study Ducky had invented was exactly that; an art for entertainment.Around the age of 20, he graduated Bard College, ready and willing to put forth his magnificent music into the world, and to make the world happy alongside his invention of Memes. Ducky spent the last 5 years, coming up with new Meme ideas, as well as entertaining crowds all over the land of Aenora, and honing his skills as an adventurer alongside companions he has met through his travels; though none of them really stuck around for very long, as many of them were just out looking for work.It was a rather welcome surprise then, when, upon taking up a job in a local tavern, Ducky had stumbled upon the very group of oddballs he would soon become great friends with; travelling the world, and going on his greatest adventure in life yet!"3/29/2018 15:46:12,Delarn Sandburrow,Half-Giant,Psychic Warrior,"Dwarven raised half-giant, that roam the desert to free enslaved half-giant tribes."3/29/2018 15:47:56,Dan,human,sorcerer,3/29/2018 15:48:34,Arneriel,Elf,Warlock,"A foundling child, he grew up in the bosom of a Fae goddess and became her lover.

His mother (Glynda Roxan) had been a popular professor in the field of planar lore, and his father (Jameson Roxan) used to be an adventurer of some renown, as far as Erin knew. As he grew a bit older however, Erin could sense that there was something they weren’t telling him, as the relationship between his parents had become somewhat strained lately. Little did he know that he would get his answers soon enough, but not in the way he had wanted. One night, a few days after his 19th birthday, Erin and his family were rudely awakened when a group of cultists invaded his home, and proceeded to trash the place. As they were attacked seemingly without cause, Erin tried to be brave by defending himself against one such cultist. Miraculously, Erin managed to disarm the attacker, knocking him unconscious with a shovel, before the young man was overpowered and beaten into submission by the others. As the family of three was held captive in their own home, the leader of the attack revealed himself. A cruel-looking Tiefling with dark-blue skin, he greeted Jameson, revealing that they were very much acquainted with each other. Ignoring Jameson’s pleas to leave him out of this, the leader prepared to ritually sacrifice the young man, only to be thwarted by another surprise visitor. Two cultists suddenly dropped dead as crossbow bolts pierced through a window and went through their skulls. Seconds later, a mysterious stranger cane crashing through what was left of the window, giving Erin enough of a distraction to slip out of the cultists’ grasp. The stranger, a rugged middle-aged man with a ponytail and an eyepatch, proceeded to make quick work of the leader’s lackeys, his dual hand crossbows piercing their robes and flesh with deadly accuracy. With no-one else left, the leader cursed Jameson’s name in a demonic tongue, before teleporting away. With the danger passed, the stranger revealed himself as Braig Zenedar, a human who was close friends with Jameson. And as this was revealed, Jameson now knew he had no choice but to tell his son the truth about him; a truth that Erin’s mother already knew. Erin learned that night that both Jameson and Braig were members of a semi-secret organization known as The Harpers, though Jameson had since retired from service in order to focus on raiding a family, hoping that Erin would grow up to have a more normal life. In the meantime, Braig had been tasked with secretly keeping an eye on the family, in case something happened to Jameson. Jameson and Glynda had been debating whether or not to tell Erin sooner, which was the cause of the marital strain from earlier. Unfortunately, now that one of Jameson’s enemies knew where he was, all three of them would have to leave the farm behind, so that Braig could take them to a Harper-owned safehouse, within the city of Berdusk. As a Harper, Jameson has apparently made enemies of the Cult of Worms, a group that worshipped twisted aberrations from the Far Realm. Although saddened and upset by the news, Erin was very grateful to Braig for coming to their rescue when they did. Along the way, Braig learned about how Erin had bravely tried to stand up to the cultists. So when the family was finally set up in the appointed safehouse, Erin was offered a choice: either stay with his parents, where he would be safe, or come to Twilight Hall with Braig, and begin training as an initiate of The Harpers. Although Jameson objected to some extent at this choice, he ultimately conceded that it was Erin’s choice. Wanting to find more answers about his father past as a Harper, and wanting to get back at the Cult for threatening his parents, Erin accepted Braig’s offer, and left with him to Twilight Hall. After a year’s worth of gruelling mental and physical training, Erin eventually surpassed the expectations of his peers, becoming very proficient in the art of dual-wielding, cutting his teeth on the local goblin and kobold population. As Braig looked on with some amount of pride, having taken a liking to the kid, Erin was able to truly join the Harpers as a fully-fledged Watcher, ready and willing to take on his first real mission for the clandestine organization.

However, his birth was struck by great misfortune when his mother perished in the process, leaving his father, Jhenovan, alone with the infant boy. Stricken by grief, Jhenovan gradually began to resent and blame Grimkhan for the death of his lover and mate. As his son grew, Jhenovan eventually spurned him entirely, leavin him to the care of a tribal elder, who taught him the fighting ways of his people as he matured. Soon enough, Grimkhan grew up to be an effective warrior for the tribe, while his father isolated himself more and more from his friends and tribe-mates, in spite of their pleas, slipping further into darkness.Then one day, the day Grimkhan was to reach the mature age of 15, Khenovan crossed the despair horizon. Unable to move on from what happened, he finally hung himself inside his own home. Having learned of the true ways of the dragonborn, Grimkhan soon grew to resent and hate his father for his cowardice in taking the ""easy way out"". And so it was that, to this day, the newly-christened warrior vowed to himself never to cower from the challenges of life, and to never retreat from a worthy foe. Seeing nothing else for his home to offer him, Grimkhan decided to leave the tribe to strike it out on his own, and scour the world for powerful beasts and foes to test the limits of his skill."3/29/2018 16:29:20,Jhuri,dragonborn,monk,"Jhuri never knew her father, and her mother had died shortly after giving birth to her. This would ultimately lead her to be passed down to the care of her criminal uncle, Kagaran the Spade. As a member of the Red Scarves Gang, Kagaran had to keep Jhuri's existence a secret from the other members because of Natalnya, tiefling leader of the gang, who had set down the rule that gang members were not permitted to have children, lest they become ""excess mouths to feed"". But out of respect for Jhuri's father, Karagan couldn't bring himself to get rid of her, and instead kept her secretly at his meager house in Crossroads City, teaching her calligraphy in order to help him forge documents for the gang. Eventually, he even told her what he knew about her father, mostly that he used to be a skilled adventurer, but allegedly perished in battle, leaving her mother to give birth alone.This was all well and good for a shockingly long time, until Beezle, a kapak draconian member of the gang, spied Karagan and a 15-year-old Jhuri and put two and two together. The moment Natalnya found out, Karagan's former ""friends"" quickly turned on him, breaking into his home and murdering him in cold blood. When Jhuri tried to fight back against them, she was rewarded for her efforts by being nearly gutted through the belly by Beezle's dagger work. But just as it seemed that Jhuri's life would end, the killers were attacked by a monk from the local monastery, forcing them to flee. Seeing Jhuri in her profusely-bleeding state, the half-elven monk sought to stabilize her out of kindness, and began to carry her to the monastery as she passed out.Days of recovery later, Jhuri's rescuer introduced himself as Vulkan, claiming to be a former friend of her father's, and extended an offer to train her in the martial arts, so that she would be able to better defend herself. Once she was well enough, Jhuri readily accepted, though primarily out of desire for vengeance. For the next four years, Jhuri became a worthwhile monk under Vulkan's tutelage, and quickly learned that anger would only deter her from reaching her potential. Although she would go on to complete her training, she would never fully rid herself of hit, instead burying her emotions under a cold and aloof exterior.Knowing that the Red Scarves would never truly leave her alone, Jhuri eventually consciously left Vulkan's care, seeking to become an adventurer, and become strong enough to tear down the Scarves, and everything they stood for."3/29/2018 16:30:05,Kriv,dragonborn,rogue,"The first true memory Kriv had upon his hatching was awakening inside the home of a female human thief.At first, when he was still learning to walk, he didn't think much of it, believing that it was somehow normal. But as he starting maturing rapidly over the next few years, he quickly realized that he was too different from the human that had apparently taken him in, and started demanding answers. The thief, Rukia Kazume, tried her best to do so, understanding that she could no longer afford to keep it a secret.Rukia had no idea who the dragonborn's real parents were, because she had found him as an egg, hidden in a section of the sewers she had been exploring in Brindol at the time. Feeling some amount of pity, she had decided to take it back with her, and try to take care of it as best as she could. ""Kriv"" had simply been the name SHE had given it. Although confused as to why his parents would ever abandon him, Kriv reluctantly accepted Rukia's story. Eventually, as Kriv continued to get older, decided that he wanted Rukia to teach him everything she knew about being a rogue, a request that his adopted mother was more than happy to indulge.Over the course of the next decade, Rukia groomed Kriv to become her successor in the various arts of rougery, starting off from petty theft and pick-pocketing, and eventually graduating to learning all the ways to kill a man, whilst remaining hidden within the dark and shady places that existed beyond the comfort of Red Larch. It was sometimes grim work, but gradually, Kriv became numbed to what he was doing. Not all of the work was dark however, as Rukia also took enjoyment out of stealing from the rich, and giving back to the poor on a regular basis.But ultimately, after Kriv became an adult at age 15, Rukia knew in her heart that she couldn't keep watching over him forever. After a long, heart-to-heart talk, Kriv and Rukia eventually concluded that they would both need to go their separate ways, in order for the dragonborn to continue to grow in his own way, without anyone else looking over him. After a hearfelt hug, and a few shed tears, Rukia left her former protege, packed her things, and left Brindol for parts unknown.Ever since becoming a true apprentice rogue, Kriv has been spending his time accepting odd jobs from pretty much anyone in Red Larch who can pay for his services, plying his beginner skills in the hopes that, one day, he might find a clue that leads him to discovering the fate of his true birth-parents, and finding out what really happened that caused him to be abandoned in the first place.

Sadly, this desire was seemingly crushed when a fateful battle with a dark sorcerer resulted in him being struck with a spell that effectively rendered him sterile. Heartbroken by this, Eadric prayed and pleaded to his deity Sune, the Chaotic Good goddess of love and beauty. Felling sympathetic to the decorated paladin's plight, Sune sent down a celestial being to provide him comfort, and angel named Fidele. Through Fidele's holy blessing, she took on a human form, and was able to infuse Eadric with some of her own fertility, long enough to undertake an intensely pleasurable copulation, after which Fidele bore an Aasimar child, and brought her into the material world.Eternally grateful for this second chance, Eadric did everything he could to raise Libitia the best that he could, teaching her the values of goodness and valor, of mercy and helping your fellow man, and of the many dangers that lie within the outside world. Despite having her own celestial duties to attend to, Fidele also took fairly regular departures to the material realm to teach her daughter all about life and love. The birds and the bees, the differences between love and lust, intimacy, the works. As Libita grew older, she quickly developed the signs of emerging divine magic inherent to her kind, but was intensely more fascinated with the arcane schools of magic, much to her father's confusion. She also developed a knack for playing Eadric's old family viol as an instrument, which became her primary hobby outside of magic studies. Her magic skills soon developed after being enrolled into the local wizarding college, and the youthful aasimar developed a curious fixation on the illusory school of wizardry, experimenting with creating visual images that represented aspects of the domain in which her divine mother resided. Libitia was more introverted during this time in her life, and while her beauty caused many a boy or man to pine after her, the aasimar always sought to wait for that ""special someone"". Someone who would love her for being her.As a young adult, Libitia was growing into an illusionary savant, while also playing her viol for small crowds on the side, but she was also realizing that many people in this world were suffering unjustly, whether under the foots of other who abused their power, or at the hands of the myriad of monsters that roamed the world. It eventually came to a point where she actually felt guilty for the comfortable life she was leaving. This all came to a head one night, when Fidele came to her in an intensely-vivid dream. In this dreamscape, the angel of love told her half-celestial daughter that a woman whose children had gone missing had prayed desperately to Sune for help for two days and two nights. Fidele knew of Libitia's growing uncertainty, and asked her if she wanted a chance to do some real good in the world, to help people like that woman. Libitia hugged her right then and there, emotionally replying....""yes"". When the two women came to Earric the next morning, the now-aging father was happy to hear Libitia say that she now wanted to use her developing skills to go further out into the world, and provide real help to those who did not have her comfortable upbringing, and to those who were suffering, even though her magical talents were not what he expected.And so, with Eadric and Fidele's blessings, Libitia voluntarily left the comfort of her home town, and set out on a journey to the town of Oakhurst, where mysterious disappearances and killings had been taking place. Wherever her travels took her, this would be the first step on a testing and trying journey the young Aasimar would never ever forget."3/29/2018 16:31:43,Sileena Blaize,tiefling,warlock,"Sileena Blaize was born amidst a caravan of travelling Tiefling gypsies, gifted in the arts of mysticism, seduction, and occasionally, assassination, depending on who could pay. Even from a young age, Sileena displayed a great degree of magical aptitude, and yet she she had always felt that something seemed...missing, as if there was something keeping her from fully unlocking her full potential. The young tiefling spent much of her childhood learning the ways of her gypsy peers, even practicing seduction on the young boys of either their own, or whatever town they happened to visit at the time.Eventually however, when Sileena reached the age of 16, the gypsies were visited by the spirit that they worshiped with great fervor: a powerful fey spirit, that would often take the guise of a stunningly beautiful eladrin male. It was at this point that Sileena's grandmother, the gypsy elder, presented Sileena before the spirit, as a new pact-mate, for it was the budding magical gifts of the warlock that Sileena had demonstrated during her childhood. But in order to seal the pact, the spirit needed to take her into her bed in a mystical act of intimacy. Trembling with a mixture of fear, trepidation, and anticipation, the young Sileena was stripped down to her nubile body within her own tent by the spirit, before she was laid down to begin. The pact-bonding ceremony seemed to last the whole night, as Sileena's new, pleasurable experience crescendoed higher, and higher. But finally, in one great big climactic moment, the private ceremony was complete, and the Fey pact was sealed.With the full range of her warlock gifts accessible to her, Sileena Blaize would go on to spend the next fifteen years refining, and honing her powers alongside her gypsy brothers and sisters, while also mastering the use of her well-endowed body to seduce whoever she wanted, and making a respectable sum of money in the process. But after such a long time amongst her collective family, the warlock became dissatisfied with her life, believing that setting out, and using her gifts as an adventurer, would allow her to continue growing in her own way. After convincing her grandmother of this, the elder gifted her with a old, magical orb that has belonged to her mother, before she went missing shortly after she was born. She finally left the gypsies on her own, and set out into the wide world, with her first destination being the city of Greenrest. Despite the money she had made in the past, she soon discovered that it would not be enough for her to have a sustainable income. Faced with the uncomfortable possibility of living in the poor house, Sileena started advertising herself as a mercenary at her earliest opportunity, whilst also taking on-and-off work as an exotic dancer for whatever inn would take her at the time, hoping that the eventual rewards of such adventuring would enable her to avoid a life of prostitution."3/29/2018 16:36:12,Agama,Tortle,Monk,"Born an only child in Maloren's Rest seemingly destined to carry on the family business of fishing, Agama always dreamed of bigger and better things.

The two tried to teach themselves from the scroll, Agama was seemingly a natural, able to summon a small puff of wind. Barrotz however wasn't able to do anything after several days of practice, growing frustrated and seeing Agama only able to summon a puff of wind declared that the scroll was useless. Agama was enamored by the teachings of the scroll and saw that the scroll was just one of many. One night Barrotz stole the scroll and left the ruins leaving Agama by himself.

But her father's status meant she was unofficially nobility and subject  of the customs of the kingdom. That meant arranged marriage.Her fiance was a good man, a paladin and lord of the knights of the realm. By all accounts, she couldn't have done better to be matched to a prince.

He grew up alone, never knowing his parents, and having only one real friend: an orphan named Sickle. The two grew up together, meeting at age 3 and immediately became inseparable. Sickle was all Fall had, and vice versa. And they were happy, but the kind of happiness that can only come from a long period of sadness.As Fall got older, he got more curious. At age 9, he and Sickle had a conversation about where they thought they came from, who they were. Sickle told Fall not to worry about his past, that it didn’t matter because he couldn’t do anything to change it. Fall took her advice lightly. He would not rest until knowing his true origins. He left Sickle alone that night, and went off into the wilderness to think, in solitude.That night, Fall dreamt of dragons. Specifically, one bronze dragon that came from the sky and flew into the wilderness behind the village. The wilderness was quickly surrounded by an impenetrable barricade of electricity. Months passed before the barrier was lifted. The dragon flew out, and the villagers rushed in and pulled something….someone...out. Fall woke up before learning who it was.Every night since then, Fall would head to the same exact spot and have the same exact dream, waking up at the same exact part where the figure would be revealed. He had to know who they were. He needed to know. Fall kept this up for 3 years until, on his 12th birthday, he arrived. He had his dream, but it was different this time. It didn’t end where it should have.The villagers in his dream pulled out a Triaxian woman, weak, feeble, barely able to stand and holding a child close to her chest…..It was the most beautiful image Fall had ever seen. And at that moment, the dream seemed to freeze and last for hours. Fall woke up the next day, surrounded by carnage. Trees had toppled, animals had been torn to pieces, and Fall was covered in ashes. He jumped up and gazed in horror at the disaster that had just missed him. Of course, he wondered what happened at first. Why he hadn’t been touched. Fall looked down at where he was resting and, unfortunately, learned the truth. In the midst of the destruction was an untouched silhouette of a young Triaxian boy, with a pair of massive wings resembling lightning bolts made from ashes, sprouting from the figure’s back. He had, unknowingly, performed his first Bloodrage. The Origin Rage. Stronger than any Rage to come. Taken aback by the scene, Fall fled home, where Sickle was waiting. She told Fall of a lightning storm that had happened in the wilderness. She told Fall of noises, ungodly screams that could only be described as pain. True pain. Pain only known by those experiencing it. She told Fall of the lights. Quick flashes of light, lasting only the blink of an eye, but blinding nonetheless. She told Fall of those who’d tried to investigate. Whatever happened to them...she didn’t say.  Then…Sickle told Fall of the blood.It was everywhere, marking the end of the storm in one of the most horrendous ways possible. It had seeped out of the wilderness, and through the village, never stopping or slowing down. It just kept going as far as the eye could see...It was too dark to be Triaxian, or anything native to Triaxus. Sickle asked Fall if he knew anything about the storm.Fall denied everything.A year past, but the memories would not. The blood streak was still present in the village, as full and dark as it had been the year prior. A reminder. Fall’s relationship with Sickle had strengthened much after the tragedy. It strengthened their belief that, if anything happened to one of them, the other would have nothing left. That had almost happened once, and they weren’t ready for it to happen again. It was now Fall’s 13th birthday. Sickle had done all she could to make this one special, the anniversary of when they’d almost lost each other. She’d gone so far as to give Fall his first gift, a steel pendant shaped like a maple leaf, inscribed with their names on the back, written in a heart. It had clearly taken Sickle months to get this for him. And to Fall, it was the most memorable gift from the memorable day of his life. That night, he had the dream again. He saw the face of the woman with the child again. And time froze, once again. It didn’t last as long as Fall remembered. It was nowhere near as powerful, and to his surprise, Fall was able to break out of it multiple times, catching glimpses of what was going on, of what He was doing.The screams came first. Then the gut-wrenching noises. Then his eyes were opened. He saw his village being bombarded by bolts of blue energy. He saw the blood streak, once dark and lifeless, now emitting a strong blue glow, forming a beacon of unknown energy that skyrocketed as far as the eye could see. He saw the townspeople, fleeing for their lives. He saw destruction everywhere he looked. Each time, closing his eyes and wincing as the woman and child appeared in his mindscape, then going dark. Fall awoke, standing among the bodies in the blood-soaked streets. Only one still breathed, barely. At his feet laid Sickle, looking up at him with a hurt look in her eyes. A look of betrayal, anger, but Fall could sense a splinter of love and hope. Her chest was raked with deep claw marks, soaked with light blood. Sickle looked deep into Fall’s eyes, seeking out a glimmer of the boy she had grown up with in the monster that stood before her. And then he had nothing.By the time he had calmed down, the Royal Guards had already come for him. The trial was quick, but painful. Fall was banished from Triaxus, forced to give up everything he knew. He was encased in a capsule, and launched into the unknown.    With his time in the capsule, Fall’s dreams changed. No longer was the woman holding a child close to her heart. There was no woman, and the child...the child was a monster, some hellish creature bearing no resemblance to a Triaxian, looming over Sickle’s fragile body, feasting on her.    Fall crashed on another planet after some time. How long, he could not guess. The capsule opened, and he was alone in a dark forest, mighty trees his only company. He had nothing.Over time, his dreams got less intense, but no less graphic. His Rage had mostly faded, weakened through long periods of calm, but still very present. It was as if his Rage was locked away, but with every battle a bit of it escapes the locks, strengthening his curse. Fall had learned to control his Rage, for now. It took time, and lots of it. Fortunately, when one is isolated, time is the one thing they can count on. On his 19th birthday, after years of survival training, Fall left the forest and entered civilization, leaving behind everything he had come to know. He had nothing, but the clothes on his back and the pendant around his neck. "3/29/2018 17:23:52,Molasses III,Slothra,Occultist,"Molasses III lived most of his life not knowing what he was. He was a Slothra, of course he knew that, but what were Slothra? He had no memory of ever meeting another Slothra. He couldn’t tell whether or not he’d even seen one before. Did they even exist? Was he a mutation? He couldn’t tell yet.Molasses was born in and grew up within the forest. His father was nowhere to be found, and his mother passed before he could walk. His only counsel was the forest, the only family he had left. He treated the trees like they were his brothers, the rivers like his sisters, and the animals better than he treated himself. In many ways, he was a Ranger back then. He lived this way until the age of 9, when he woke to the sounds of the forest. It was different this time. The forest was no longer calm and relaxing. Tonight, it was screaming. Molasses burst out of his den and stared in awe at his surroundings. What hadn’t already been taken was covered with flames, burning bright and true. What had been reached was reduced to a pile of smoldering ashes. Molasses could tell by the fire’s intensity that it wasn’t natural. There was something magical about it, he could tell. What kind of magic, he had no clue, but he didn’t have time to investigate. Molasses turned his back on his burning home and ran. He escaped minutes before the fire had engulfed everything. Everything. It was all gone.After leaving his home, Molasses became a wanderer. With nowhere to go and nowhere to stay, he wandered for three months until he reached civilization, and collapsed in front of the gates. He woke up in a hospital, an armored woman in the bed next to him. She was clutching her side, dark blood staining her hands. It seemed she would have little time left if nothing were done. Molasses rushed out of his bed in search for herbs, crushing them into a paste that he applied to the woman’s wound. It took 2 months for the woman, who Molasses learned was named Celeste, to heal. In those 2 months, Molasses earned a reputation within the kingdom. He was the mysterious stranger, unknown origin, unknown race. There were some who saw him as a monster, others a refugee. After Celeste healed, she became Molasses’ mentor. She taught him how to speak Common, among other languages. She taught him how to read, both words and people. Most importantly, she taught him how to fight. Celeste gave Molasses her Earth Breaker, a weapon she had once used daily. Since joining the army, however, she’d been limited to sword and shield.They lived like this for 6 years, the happiest years of their lives. They went on countless adventures, looking after one another at all times. After hostage situations, battling armies, killing a lich, and many others, they found themselves in a massive catacombs. In front of them sat an altar, behind them only darkness. Molasses cautiously approached the altar, laying his Earth Breaker on it, and looked around. From the darkness came a creature, something neither had ever encountered. The creature lunged at Celeste with such force, she was defeated instantly. Her body became still and lifeless, but her invisible soul still lingered in the air. Fearing complete abandonment, the soul of Celeste inhabited Molasses’ Earth Breaker. It was an artifact, in a way, a remnant of both their pasts. After narrowly escaping the same fate, Molasses immediately began researching. He read every book in the library, but it wasn’t enough. Nowhere in his collection held the key to resurrection. He had heard tales, however, of a book with the answer to summoning creatures powerful enough to restore Celeste’s form. The Necronomicon. This book, fact or fiction, was Molasses’ best choice. He risked his life for leads on the location of such a tome, but got nowhere. He almost died many a time, but that didn’t stop him. Through all this from inside the Earth Breaker, Celeste lived on, unbeknownst to Molasses. She protected him, as she’d always done. She also tried to stop him, knowing it was hopeless. Even if he were successful, a body with no soul was still just a body, and she was trapped. Helpless, she watched for years as Molasses tore himself up trying to find a way. He is still searching.Molasses joined the hunt for the Tower for one reason and one reason alone. If the legends are true, the Tower will hold the greatest treasures known by the living. If he could find answers anywhere, it’s there. Molasses’ journey is for one thing, and one thing only.Celeste"3/29/2018 17:24:39,Mythheart (Kaval Ergashed),Dragonborn,Paladin,"My name is Kaval Ergashed, or, at least it was. I was the firstborn of a poor family in the slums of Draconia. My mother, Shivan, died in childbirth, leaving me to be raised by my father, Gevran Ergashed. Being raised in the poor sections, I was quickly influenced by the violent nature of my neighbors, which my strict father did not approve of. He often told me all he ever wanted was to get me out of there. “But Lord Savras wants us here” he would always say. I was raised by the faith of Lord Savras, god of divination, truth, and fate.When I turned 7 years old, I was recruited into a gang known as The Black Sirens by the leader, a gray dragonborn by the name of Silver. They promised me the usual; fame, fortune, brotherhood. Silver was like a brother to me, so I made sure not to disappoint him. I was trained to gather information, by any means possible. I was forged into a killer. I swiftly moved up through the ranks, and by the time I was 10, had become a ruthless bounty hunter. With each man I killed, my reputation grew. I became known on the streets as ‘The Heartless One’, as I had never taken mercy on my target. I tried desperately to keep my father blind to what I was doing, as he would never approve.I was only able to keep the charade up for 3 years. When I was 13, I got back from a hunt late at night. My scales were cloaked with blood. I walked in the door, carrying a bloody sword with arrows in my arm. But my father was waiting for me. He took one glance at me and instantly knew what I had become. He told me no son of his would be a killer. He took out his whip and lashed me twice, leaving a large ‘X’ scar on my back. I lashed out at him, forgetting who he was and going by my training.I killed him in cold blood.By the time I had figured out what I had done, it was too late. He was unhealable. I knew I couldn’t stay, so I packed my things and made plans to head for the next town over. But as I walked outside, Silver appeared at my door. He peeked behind me and found what I had done. And he congratulated me. He told me my father was only holding me back, and that I could be unstoppable now. Nothing to hide from, nobody to keep me from my future. And the rage hit again. Silver was dead on my doorstep before I knew it. It was because of his gang that I had murdered my father,I was captured by my gang mates before leaving town. I was taken to Black Sirens HQ, the sewers. The leadership had passed to Blaze, a bronze dragonborn. Silver’s little brother. I was kicked out, and given one day before they would come after me, a courtesy they gave all traitors. If I was ever seen again, I would be captured, taken to Blaze, and killed. It was there, in the sewers underneath the Draconian dump, where I vowed to make things right with my father, and disband The Black Sirens.When I reached the next town, I started cursing to Lord Savras. Out of all the lives he could’ve given to me, he made me a killer, a traitor and a deserter. I blamed him for all of my problems. But when the rage had subsided, I asked him to change who he had made me.I realized I needed to reinvent myself. I rejected my family name, Kaval Ergashed, and took up my new identity. I became Mythheart, my version of the name the Sirens had given to me, so I would never forget what I am fighting for; but also, it was my way of carrying around my shame. Every time someone says my name, I am reminded of the crimes I’ve committed and the history I’ve made. I would never be worthy of my family name until then.After I left that town, I made way for the forest. I set up camp in a cave I discovered deep within. I stayed there for three nights, but on the morning of the fourth, I was awoken by the sound of hooves beating on the ground. I hobbled out of the cave to find a group of men in heavy armor. They called me by my new name, which I had not yet told anybody. They told me to gather my things, and I was taken away to an old marble monastery. It was there that I was told I had been called to Paladinship by Lord Savras himself.I told them there had to be a mistake, but they told me the instructions given by Lord Savras had been very clear. I attempted to refuse, but they told me Lord Savras would never allow it. Even if they hadn’t taken me, I still would’ve found my way.I was trained, against my will, in the Order of Lord Savras. I was trained slowly, learning the ways of stealth better than anything else. I made good friends with the cooks, an elf named Fern and a halfling named Sun. They had great talent, able to turn anything into a delicious meal. On the night before my official naming as Paladin, I was visited in my dreams by Lord Savras. He told me I needed to be a Paladin, it was my fate, and the world would not be the same if I thought differently. I became a Paladin, much to my dismay. Most Paladins are honored, but I thought of it more as a curse. I was not happy, and I wanted to find a way out. After being released, I committed small crimes to try to rid my life of the power of Savras. But Lord Savras would never allow it.People started looking at me with respect instead of fear. Everywhere I went, I was honored as a Paladin. There were some, of course, who did not take kindly to me. But everywhere I went, I brought my past with. Just because I’m a Paladin doesn’t mean I can dishonor my vow to myself. My Paladinship only made my vow stronger. The Black Sirens are evil that I need to rid the world of.Every year, on November 24th, the anniversary of my father’s death, I return to Draconia to visit my parents at the cemetery. I make sure I am not seen or followed. I light a torch for each of them, then leave because I was not not ready to make things right. I needed to be stronger. I go to the monastery, where I stay for the night. I’ve started collecting delicacies from other lands to bring to Sun and Fern. The recruits always ate well that night.When I met the main group in Newton, I was trailing a member on a hunt. I found him in a tavern and discovered he was just a mere rookie. I gave him the choice of death or desertion. He was cooperative. I was glad he had turned away from the darkness. I left the building and prepared to leave Newton, when the fire started. I could not save the rookie.The year before I met up with the group, The Black Sirens found me at the cemetery. They’ll be expecting me when I go back, on the fifth anniversary of my father’s death. They must be taken care of when I return. I am ready."3/29/2018 17:40:00,Ali Kashaam,Vishkanya ,Bard,Run away concubine and petty criminal 3/29/2018 17:42:58,Kamagumi Yume,Aasimar,Cleric,"Kamagumi followed a trickster God to earth as small child and was adopted by a pair of gay professors.

He grew up learning the trade of alchemy, selling stuff to locals.  The family also had a specific clientele.  They must have been relatives since they all had the Smith surname, despite being many different races.  As he grew up he learned these guys were assassins and that his family was selling poisons to them.  These were small time assassins that lived around the area.  When Poshment came of age to take over the family business, he decided to leave in the middle of the night and go to the large city of Magnimar.  Once in the town, he joined the bard’s college.  Once there he made up a new family and came up with a new name, filled with lots of relatives that all led interesting lives.  He completely changed his look so that he would not be recognized in his home town.  He went back with one of his new personas to Wartle.  No one recognized him at all.

In shock, he cried out for his brother to stop, when something miraculous happened.He listened. "3/29/2018 19:25:59,Despair,Tiefling,Warlock,"""You thought you could betray ME?!""The Old One, a Being Who Should Not Exist, screams in outrage at the slight figure standing before him.""I gave you my power through the Pact. I GAVE you the power to fulfill your lifes mission. Many have felt your vile touch and ended up exactly as you desire! HOW DARE YOU REFUSE TO UPHOLD YOUR END OF OUR BARGAIN!!!""The small figure smiles defiantly up at his 'benefactor'. ""Our bargain was your power for my soul. Your power has been granted and my soul is forfeit BUT your end of the bargain is not complete."" He takes a low, mocking bow. His next words drip with venom. ""My lord.""""The bargain was for your power until I can fill the world with my namesake! Many suffer but not nearly enough! Not even by half! I say it is YOU who is trying to betray our bargain!"" Crimson eyes flash in a brilliant display of rage and power.The Old One glares angrily down at the young tiefling and tries to find flaw in his logic but cannot. He is indeed trying to take the soul of this powerful yet headstrong warlock. But he will not admit defeat nor admit he was trying to cheat. So he took it upon himself to alter the situation in his favor. He became fixated on erasing this foolish mortal from existence. Drawing forth the entirety of his incredible power, the Old One unleashed a wave of force with a singular purpose. To destroy all it touches. This included the forest around them, the countless numbers of creatures within and most importanly the annoyingly smug warlock Despair.But before that destructive wave could harm a single cell of anything within its range the world shifted. All color drained from the sky, the leaves, the creatures and even the power unleashed from the Old One. All became motionless, stopped in the moment. All save for the Old One and Despair. And one other.""I think that will be QUITE enough out of the two of you!"" Chronos bellowed as he stepped forth through a rift in time. ""I absolutely despise stopping time like this but you've left me with no other alternative. Do you know how much energy this takes?! The only larger drain on my power came from a group of fools traveling backwards in time to try and rewrite history!"" The powerful figure of the Lord of Time stopped in the direct center between the Old One and Despair. He turned his fury first to the Old One.""This is your SECOND warning in as many aeons! You can't simply destroy an entire ecosystem because of the irritation caused by a mortal! Any further infractions will result in erasure!""The Old One's head shifted forward. Not quite a bow but more of a sad, sulking measure. ""What's the use of all this power if I can't destroy the things that irritate me?""Chronos shook his head and waved his hand in a negligent manner. ""You can destroy your irritants, by all means! Just KEEP the destruction to what is irritating you! No more mass destruction unless brought about by prophesy!""""Yes Lord Chronos."" the Old One intoned sadly. As he turned away and began sliding back to his own plane of existence a lowly muttered ""Asshole."" could be heard faintly before he disappeared altogether.Chronos finally turned to face Despair who had been watching the Old One get torn a new orifice with the greatest amusement. ""Wipe that smile off your face, insect!"" Despair's face melted from amusement to glaring hatred.""I am no in..."" ""SILENCE! You continue to exist ONLY because I did not want to listen to this Plane's protector file a complaint! I've been keeping my eye on what you've been doing with this power."" Chronos held up a hand to stop the protest he knew was coming. ""Yes, yes. I know. 'I am Despair. My goal in life is to spread my namesake to the world that shunned me simply for existing.' I am WELL aware of your intentions, your reasons. I even don't begrudge you your desire either. You mortals, who live so briefly yet so fiercely, are free to live your lives as you see fit. No. What I have been watching is HOW you've been doing it. Using the power granted from the Old One to twist the minds of those around you into doing things they should not do and only freeing their minds when the task is complete so they can live the rest of their lives in utter misery at doing precisely what they would never do.""At this point Chronos paused to take a breath from his tirade and gave Despair some time to speak. However limited that time would be depended on how Despair answered. ""I used magic to charm those heartless bastards, yes. I cannot nor will I deny it. I'm proud of it. BUT! I did not twist any minds. Every person charmed. Every person who did such unspeakable acts. Did so because the desire to do it was within them in the first place! A husband's desire to remove his family from the picture so he could have the woman that wanted nothing to do with him when she found he was married. A child's desire to kill their friend so they can have that coveted toy. All we mortals possess darkness. I simply help them draw it out!""Chronos looks thoughtfully down at Despair, stroking a beard that seems to eternally shift from the coarse black bristles of youth to the gray wispy strands of old age. ""You have a point, warlock. All you mortals do in fact possess darkness. But few act on it. And those majority that do not, do not for a reason you have failed to pick up on. All mortals ALSO possess light within them. That husband wouldn't have ever acted on his desire because his desire was fleeting. That woman completed his soul. His children gave him reason to lead a good life to set an example for his legacy. That child would never have acted on the impulse to kill his friend because he knew his friend was always willing to share his toys with his friend. You see only the darkness, Despair. Because you have blinded yourself to the light."" Stormy gray eyes bore into the mortal before him. ""Very well. I WAS going to destroy you utterly for your actions but I will not, now. I will give you a chance. This moment and all before it will be forgotten by you. By even your very body. I will turn back the clock for you and you alone. Your body will de-age to the point before your magical studies led you to forming a pact with the Old One. You will forget all spells and all powers granted by him. You will forget all time from that moment until now. All moments save for the knowledge that you became a warlock. The knowledge that you wished to fill the world with despair. And the knowledge that something profound has changed. And this shall all happen.""""NOW!"" Despair shouts as he wakes from his dream. ""Bloody nightmares! Always shocking you awake and leaving you with a feeling of dread but no recollection of what the damn thing was about!"" The sound of crunching paper turns his crimson gaze to what is held in his hand. Unfurling the length of parchment he begins to read. ""An invitation from....Lady Morwen? To her estate in Daggerford? What in the planes is a 'death house'?"" After some brooding over what to do and taking some time to shake off the remaining feeling of dread from that dream, a small smile tugged at his sinuous lips. ""Maybe these folks need a little despair in their lives. And Despair is only to happy to provide!""As he exits a house he cannot for the life of him remember living in, he utters in a voice dripping with venom words he doesn't remember uttering a thousand times before. ""I just hope there aren't any bloody halflings!"""3/29/2018 19:48:41,Saenae Alder,Half-elf,Paladin,"Illegitimate daughter of an unknown elf and a silversmith.

Waking up penniless in the gutter, he was taken in by the clerics of Pelor, the god of light and forgiveness. Normally, the adherents of Pelor are pacifists, but the temple was under pressure from local organized crime.

Though barely more than a beast, the glyphs taught themselves to Ruskin and the pattern they made called out to something. Something primal. Something both hungry and fecund. Something deeper than the world itself. Only the harsh, antisymbolic conditioning of the druids allowed him to break contact, but his mind was shattered, and the spell remains incomplete, buried in his psyche. Now he hides and hunts. Terrified of a shifting array of natural aspects; goats, toads, particularly suggestive trees... anything that risks him remembering the pattern.

He was sold through the thriving slave business and ended up Galione.Vyurinn was sold to an old elven wizard, called Saevar, who used the vast  jungles of Mudai as his personal experimenting grounds for various rites and rituals. The young dragonborn was made to lug around gear for Saevar and do the general domestic chores in his home.The work wasn't too bad, Vyurinn had heard of plenty of slaves who were beaten, starved and misused. He even grew up sort of liking the old wizard, even if he wasn't the friendliest of the bunch, Vyurinn could see the humour in the mispleased Saevar's demeanor.It was because of Saevar that Vyurinn developed an interest in the arcane. He picked up stray bits of lore, even if Saevar did his best to hide it all.He grew ever more curious, until one day he snuck into the old elf's library to look at some books. Here, he read grand tales of other planes of existence and read of great dragons, even draconic gods!He started sneaking into this library more and more.He eventually found a dusty old tome, which spoke of making contact with these other planes he had read so much about.After dreaming about the place for so long, he eventually gathered up his courage and started stealing the needed supplies, relying on the trust he built with Saevar, along with the elf's old age to get away with it.Eventually he managed to gather everything and set out to attempt the ritual.What he did attempt, went horribly wrong however. The ritual not only failed, but caused the entire house to collapse in on itself.Vyurinn was knocked unconscious.In this dreamstate, he saw beautiful visions of seven grand mountains, surrounded by silvery lakes. He saw a giant castle built in these mountains, made of mithral, surrounded by several dragons flying around it.One of these dragons took notice of him and spoke to him. It was an ancient female silver wyrm, who introduced herself as Vaexthuril.As they spoke, Vaexthuril saw the good and kind heart of Vyurinn and the predicament he was in. She offered him freedom of his bonds, along with certain power, if only he would go out into the world and spread good, helping those in need and vanquishing evil.Vyurinn eagerly accepted.Eventually, he awoke in a bed, with a halfling over him, tending to his wounds.The tiny halfling was startled, but welcomed Vyurinn back to the land of the living. He was in a temple of Ilmater, where they had been tending to him. He explained that he had been unconscious for several days after having a house fall down on him. Apparently everyone thought that the old wizard had finally gone too far in his arcane doings and had led to his own demise. How lucky Vyurinn must be to still be alive!Realising that the truth would lead to nothing good, Vyurinn kept his mouth shut.The halfling eventually left him to rest some more.Vyurinn felt a renewed vigor wash over him and saw his wounds close before his eyes. He felt energized and decided he should leave as soon as possible.He got up and walked out of the temple, thanking the halfling, who was shocked to see him walking around, seemingly uninjured.He left Galione and set out into the world, helping where he could, learning various arcane secrets on his travels."3/30/2018 6:41:05,Aldo Clearwater,Halfling,Sorcerer,"Aldo was walking along the beach not far from his home village, when he discovered a stone with a strange symbol engraved on it.

My village was simple, and we thought the world a much smaller place than it is. But that all changed one day. The first sign of trouble was the goblin raids. They were infrequent at first, but it grew into a war. The Goblin War. Something had to be done, so after the fourth goblin attack I founded a militia to protect the village, and we called ourselves the Brotherhood of Pitchforks. I trained the villagers to fight using our makeshift weapons: hoes, axes, pitchforks, and the like. As the goblin’s attacks became more ferocious, so did we in the Brotherhood. It was five years from the first goblin raid to the end of the war, and I think we must have exterminated the goblins. By this point many of us villagers were seasoned veterans, so when the giants showed up, wanting to take our land and force us to pay taxes to their king, we resisted. We fought off their first attack easily enough, they hadn’t expected much from a village of halflings, but after a while they came back bringing all their tools of war. Humans really are remarkable warriors when they put their minds to it, and their massive size at nearly twice the height of a halfling gives them an edge. The trick is to go for their knees, and to keep your shield skyward. At one point during the battle, a trebuchet destroyed the granary, and at this point I become flooded with a righteous fury. This was the point that the god of strength had chosen me, and it was as if I was indestructible. I fought and killed two hundred human warriors that day, and the few that remained were terrified of me. But they placed a bounty on my head so large that others would come and assault my village, trying to get at me. Eventually I had to leave for the sake of everyone else. And now I am on the road, a wanderer, wondering why the god chose me."3/30/2018 8:43:37,Modoc tje Magnificent,Human,Wizard,"CR 98“I am tired Grandfather, why have I been summoned,” the old man whined. “I have served the family for over three hundred years, but the life extending magics are exhausted, and I’m ready to die.”The cold voice drifted across the ancient tower, “Three hundred years? Empires are laid low for the secrets that gave you those three hundred years, and yet you protest. Your family requires your services, and yet you protest. You disappoint me Archmage Terem yn Ujemi.” The creature, with a gesture, waved away the further titles.The old man bowed his head in rebuke. “I am sorry for my insolence Grandfather, but my divinitions have revealed this to be the day of my death. I do not understand what I can do for you with so little time left.”“Less than an hour to be precise.” If the mercurial creatures face held pity or compassion it did not show, though its gesture was one of paternal familiarity.“I require one last obedience of you grandson of my grandson,” the lich said. “Candlekeep has turned away my agents. Olmur, the new Keeper of Tomes has decreed that seekers can stay no more than a ten day, and only the avowed now have direct access to the library. To fully preserve the revelations of Alaundo, he claims. I cannot abide being denied access. I need an agent in the library to conduct my research”.“What of Candlekeep? Myth Drannor rises to greater heights everyday. Its libraries have long past eclipsed that of those odd monks and their chanting circles. I do not understand! I am to die today, how can I be of any further help to the family in this matter?” Terem asked.""Mulhorand slain, Mystryl sacrificed, when even Gods fall what are the works of mortals. Narfell and Rauathar are ghostly echoes of the past. Calamities will come again and those that are high will be felled, those that are low will become ascendant. Cities that do not yet exist will have high kings not yet born. It is not the past you work toward, or even the present.""  For a man at the end of his life, the past was all his mind could think of. His eyes followed the form of the creature his mother had brought him to almost two hundred ninety years ago, she had called him Grandfather also. He remembered the tears in her eyes, now long gone to the house of the dead. “For the family,” she had said leaving the crying youth behind.Terem saw the lich pause on front of a table, on it was a book. The title read, “First Expedition to the Shadow Plane. Journal of Killium the Arcanist of Xinlenal”. Other objects the Archmage could easily identify as common in the enchantment of an item, other things, though his knowledge of magic was vast, were unfamiliar to him.""Karsus's Folly cost me much,"" the once human creature said, his hollow voice ringing through the hall. ""So much of my power was lost, it has taken years to recover. In truth, I have not and cannot ever return to the heights I once held. I have learned patience though, through my long years. It is a virtue you shall now have to learn as well.""""I am confused Grandfather. I do not,"" Terem started. As the lich turned he saw in its hand a ornate pendant, princely in its worth. Then he saw the Athame. ""No Grandfather"".Archmage Terem felt his muscles seize, despite his considerable will and defences. The chants of the lich echoing in the workroom. He tried to focus on his years of arcane training and research, lost and forbidden knowledge he had gleaned from dusty and forgotten towers. All came to the same conclusion, there was nothing that could be done. The divinitions were correct, he would die this day.""Less than a few moments left grandson"".It seemed to Terem that he almost heard regret in the empty voice. If it existed it did not stop the inexorable arc of the ceremonial blade or the brief pain that followed.""I shall keep your phylactery with me, protected from all harm,"" the creature stated in between chants. He lifted the book and placed it on the corpse of the old mage. Skeletal fingers clutched the cover and opened it, holding it deathly still as it brought an ivory pen inscribed with runes, it nib filled with a golden ink gleaming with its own inner light.With death, the cold fingers of fear had released Terem. It surprised him to find oblivion did not follow. He was still aware. Although blinded, knowledge of his surroundings still filled his senses. Throwing out this awareness he watched the creature he called Grandfather work with calm precision, tirelessly anointing the edges of each page with tiny runes.""No Terem, there is no peace in death for either of us, we shall continue to protect our family. For you, Candlekeep will be your home, protect it well. In the years to come when your shade rises in its defence you will be looked upon as a guardian of the walled library. They will think nothing of your ghostly form roaming its halls. They will tell themselves you were once of the avowed. All while you obtain for me the knowledge that I need. The tomes that others bring will enhance my knowledge. If Candlekeep falls, mayhap you will end up in another useful library.""The spirit once known as the Archmage Terem continued to watch dispassionately as the lich he once called Grandfather patiently waited for the golden ink to dry and start again. It was over a hundred pages before the spirit realized the creature would press unduly hard on the nib pressing the ink deeply through the page. It took almost a thousand before the shade understood.The inhuman thing that worked ever so patiently felt the spirits understanding, and was pleased. ""Your phylactery holds your soul, while the book holds your spirit. As long as your soul is protected the book cannot be truly destroyed. It will always reform and call your spirit back. It is the only one of its kind, and Candlekeep will always desire you returned.""It continued to speak, uncharacteristically verbose, pleased with its own guile. ""As long as you are in the library, I shall enter at my leisure. The monks will look at each page with care, the magics obvious even to a dullard. They will check each page carefully, first one side then the other, their study will be most thorough. The Avowed lack the wit to discern what I have hidden, for the magic circle I have created does not run along its pages, but through them. In as long as this hidden gate exists, with your awareness to draw me in, no ward now or in the future shall prevent my entry.""As the echo of his voice faded from the chamber the lich drew the final rune on the final page. The chant of many magics filled the air, some of the spells Terem recognised, non-detection, protection, and some he did not. As if to mark the end of his labors, the lich pressed his left skeletal hand onto the inside of the front cover, leaving a black claw print in the tome.Finally, the lich called for his servants.If the awareness that had been Syl-Vizer Terem yn Ujemi yn Sardikar el makhlab-dabab yi Memnon could be startled the sight of his former apprentice, a nephew,  entering would have done so. There had been no sense of time, but the boy he had left was now aged and bent.""Grandfather,"" He said, his eyes wide with fear as he received his instructions and scurried out of the room.House Talonmist traces their lineage back to the great diviner Sardikar Makhlb-dabab, descended from the Djinn, Imperial Dreamer of Calimshan and called the talon in the mist by his enemies now long dead. After being granted a vision foretelling of the Red Plague of -990 DR he fled north from Calimport with his family. Despite his attempt to save them, all except his youngest child perished in the plague. He railed against the arbitrary nature of the plague and his impotence in aiding his family. Sardikar became obsessed with the study of disease and death. He travelled the world with a singular purpose, he would defeat death and protect his lineage.His obsession led him to seek a greater understanding of the dark arts and necromancy. Seeking to tease out the secrets of lichdom, as a means of forestalling his death; and by extension guiding and securing the legacy of his family. Since then the he has shepherded the various branches around Faerûn, and watched from afar. For generations they bred and scattered across the Sword Coast and Western Heartlands. Acting as an unassuming family of merchants while slowly gathering magical lore and secrets. Tahlaunmiiz was the name his descendants bore in Westgate, Talonmist in Waterdeep. Though throughout the centuries, those descendants of both houses who showed an aptitude for the arcane mysteries would be sent off the family seat of ""Kingsgrave Manor"". Where they were to apprentice under the immutable patriarch, the lich Sardikar Makhlb-dabab, the talon in the mist.In recent years the Talonmist family has been embroiled in a simmering feud with the Harpells, an upstart family of wizards from Longsaddle. Whom have disrupted Talonmist activities and acquisitions in the past. Members of the opposing families have even been known to engage in duels to the death when tensions boil over. The Talonmists also harbor a cold relationship with the Red Wizards, seeing the new expansion of the merchant-mages into the Sword Coast as a threat to the family business.It is in this time, some 2,500 years after the exodus from Calimshan, that Modoc was born. The second of Jaheira and Ajantis Talonmist's three children, his early childhood was free of any significant turmoil or crisis. Modoc's parents made their living as spice merchants in the bustling port city of Waterdeep; and while they were not wealthy, they lived a comfortable lifestyle. This afforded their children the opportunity to receive an education. It was in this environment of learning and study that Modoc began to thrive. He read voraciously, sometimes late into the night and would often be gently scolded by his mother, for using to many candles when caught. However, it would not be long before Modoc's education became a source of umbrage. The normally peaceful home would erupt with cantankerous argument. As the young savant challenged the teachings of his tutors, in subjects that encompassed everything from theological matters, to natual theories, and even the wonders of the higher mysteries. The study was often a room in the throws of raucous debate, in which Modoc's energy was spent disputing, correcting, and badgering his tutors. All the while demanding evidence of their teachings. Invariably these educators would resign amid a string of curses as they stormed from the family home. These resignations began to become a burden on the family finances, we well as a disruption to the education of their other children. Finding no other recourse for the dangerous intellect of their son the parents decided it was time. They sent a message, and received a response. Modoc was to be delivered to Kingsgrave Manor, where he would examined and tested; and if he was deemed worthy he would be formally apprenticed to the venerable ""Grandfather Sar"". The precocious youth was sent east by carriage and arrived at an ancient fortified manor house set atop one of the rolling hills north of the town of Triel. The manor itself seemed to be built over many centuries. With evidence of several different construction phases and techniques, giving the structure an overall disjointed and bizarre appearance. Once admitted into the enigmatic building Modoc was questioned at length. Scrutinized by robed men and women of unclear relation to the boy though they bore a distinct resemblance to his father. Eventually he was taken to an antechamber deep in the vaults under the manor, the door to the room beyond was covered in luminous blue runes. At this point his robed guides instructed Modoc to ""Wait here"" before the pair turned and hurried from the crypt-like atmosphere of the vaults.Several hours passed before the door swung open as if by some invisible force. It took Modoc a moment to summon to courage to enter. When he did the scene the greeted the boy nearly overwhelmed his senses. Smoke from burning incense hung in several gilded brazzers perfuming the air. A small library's worth of the tomes and scrolls sat in a massive, overstuffed, bookshelf and many more lay stacked on the floor and tables throughout the room. A number of crystals arcing electricity, hovered in place, occasionally shifted from one side of the room to the other.  In a corner sat a wooden table of polished ebony holding carefully arranged and straightened lengths of hair. Each set is tied together with bright blue string. The  sigil of house Talonmist covered much of the floor. The design is cut into the floor and its tiny channels are full of glistening mercury. In the center of the room stood the desiccated and mummified figure of Grandfather Sar. He was clothed in ivory colored robes trimmed with gold, his fingers and throat heavy with jewellery. Small crystalline stones floated above his head, atop which sat a circlet made of opalescent stone. The only thing that kept the boy from fleeing the chamber was sheer awe. As Grandfather Sar reached out a skeletal hand to gesture the youth forward he said ""You need not fear me my child. But know this, your existence shall be that, which I weave for you out of sorrow and woe.""Initially Modoc split the majority of his days either assisting his master with alchemical experiments, deep in study, or carefully aiding with embalming rituals to fortify the liches deteriorating form. Though as the years progressed Modoc's apprenticeship became an affair of extremes. In one moment Grandfather Sar would patently guide the young mage through the intricacies of The Weave and spellcraft. The next the old lich would set impossible goals for any budding wizard to attain. And when Modoc would inevitably fail, his master was harsh and unforgiving. Evidence of the lich's cruelty was most evident at the end of his time at Kingsgrave Manor.He was told by Grandfather Sar to prepared to a journey to the Shadowfell, no doubt so the lich could achieve some secret end. The process seemed simple; an aperture opened like a jaw, and swallowed them and they passed into another space. But something happened when the pair attempted to plane shift. And an error left Modoc separated from his master and alone in the Feywild. At first he could only stare, open-mouthed, stunned at the resplendent natural beauty before him. But he was soon shocked out of this trance. The sound of his master's voice boomed inside of his head. ""Return triumphant or die forgotten"" the old lich said, and then it was silent.  By happenstance or destiny, Modoc had entered the Feywild in the territory of a Brass dragon named Parthanax. The dragon kept a keen eye on its domain and quickly ""collected"" the spellcaster as a sort of curio. Parthanax brought Modoc back to its lair, ""The Grand Hall of Conversation"" where it spent the majority of its time entertaining friends and visitors. The lair also contained an elegant foyer, a gallery for the artwork the dragon collected, sleeping chambers, of course a treasure vault that housed the dragon's horde. Pathanax loved to engage his guest in hours of long winded debate, and Modoc was no exception. This environment suited the young mage and he spent countless hours in deep conversation with the dragon and it's visitors. During his time in the Feywild, Modoc learned answers to questions his had not know to ask. After several months with the dragon he was able to convince Pathanax to send him back to the Material Plane.He entered near Luskan and was quickly able to make his way to the city. Penniless and far from home, he initially tried to acquire the coin for the journey by taking the moniker Modoc the Magnificent and plying his trade as a street magician. Though it didn't take long to realize that more direct action was necessary. He hired on with a group of adventurers, the party consisted of Gorignak a goliath berserker, James the Younger a sly priest of Tymora, and Kamali a half-elf troubadour. They had been tasked with escorting an elderly priest South to Neverwinter, a city still recovering from the ravages of the Spellplague. The companions made good time on the road to Neverwinter, and delivered the abbot safe and sound to his temple in the city. The group spent little time in Neverwinter before heading South toward Waterdeep, where Modoc planed to part ways with his acquaintances and continue on to Kingsgrave Manor alone.When the adventurers arrived in the village of Oakhurst, on the road south of Neverwinter, the villagers beseeched the party for their help. Kobolds had taken up residence in a nearby ravine, and had been stealing livestock from local farmers. With the promise of reward the party set out the clear the kobold lair. But in a strange turn of events, the minstrel Kamali, was able to negotiate a treaty with the villagers and the kobold matriarch Yidrasil. From there the group traveled on toward Waterdeep, but the adventurers would never make it. In a roadside inn they heard a rumor, a young dragon had ousted a group of dwarves from their mine near Mirabar. Anyone who could clear the mine stood to profit greatly. All Modoc had to hear was ""dragon"" to start making excuses to postpone his trip home and urge the group back north.After a few weeks of travel the explorers had reached the mine of Khundakar and began preparations to plumb it's depths. The place was cavernous and seemed to descend for miles. When the group had finally reached the bottom, they found their quarry. A black dragon the size of an ettin. The beast fought ferociously but in the end, the creature fell to spellfire and force of arms. After gathering samples from the dragon, while the others gathered treasure. Modoc and the party set out for the mine's exit. Upon reaching the surface, the group encountered a single human male dressed in dark leather. The man introduced himself as Antony and stated he belonged to a group that specializes in the finding and acquisition of magic items known as the Black Hand. Impressed that the party had beaten him to the punch. He offered them a job on the spot, and with it an opportunity to join this network of shadowy archaeologists and tomb raiders. *Caught up in the excitement and promise of the whole affair, within days the friends and new employer were on a ship bound for Chult. Modoc was sure his master would overlook the delay when he returned with the arcane secrets gathered from such a mysterious land. They sailed into Refuge Bay, the coastal settlement of Ishau sank into sea during Spellplague and the city’s stone buildings lay submerged a few hundred yards off shore. The party disembarked on to the beach at the southeastern edge of the bay. On the shore sat a small fishing village constructed out of driftwood, palm fronds, and materials scavenged from the ruined city. Modoc and his companions entered the village and after offering gifts to the locals they were able to secure a guide. They stayed the night in a small driftwood hut offered by the chieftain. All except Modoc who was forced to sleep in the small rowboat they had brought ashore due to the villagers mistrust of magic. In the morning the party, except Modoc, received some parting gifts and blessings from the tribe before heading into the sweltering jungle. By this time Antony had become the tacit leader of the group. He spent most of his time conferring with the guide, checking his map, and reassuring the adventurers they were on the right track. In contrast, Gorignak told tall tales of his many feats of strength and taphouse exploits to anyone who would listen. The minstrel Kamali was constantly plucking at his mandolin and tuning its strings while complaining about the humidity warping his instrument. All the while James whispered silent prayers to Tymora as his eyes darted about searching the foliage and undergrowth for any sign of danger. In total the journey took four day before the party finally caught sight of the temple of Tamoachan. This ancient shrine had lay forgotten for centuries and had only recently been located by the Black Hand. The massive limestone step pyramid that greeted them was engulfed by the vines and moss, looking like a fang pushing up through the jungle floor. It was decided that Antony and the local guide would maintain a camp while the rest of the group entered and cleared the temple. They entered through a sinkhole that had opened up next to the structure and caused part of its foundation to collapse. Pushing through the lower levels they encountered a poisonous haze that hung in the air and sapped at their strength. They were further impeded hazardous traps and the denizens of the temple. Eventually the party reached the upper levels of the pyramid and the miasma faded. After entering the throne room of the temple they were faced with a long forgotten undead chieftain that had ruled over Tamoachan in years past. After defeating this threat the group was faced with one last obstacle. An Oni occupied the highest level of the structure and stood between the party and the exit. The friends steeled themselves for battle against the demon. Gorignak charged forward striking at the Oni wildy with his massive gleaming axe. James moved to flank the creature where he could attack from the demon’s blind spot. Kamali and Modoc stood further away slinging spells at the beast. With a simple gesture from the Oni the entire chamber became freezing winds and driving snow, obscuring the party's vision. Before they could react the demon teleported between the two spell casters. Bringing down it's massive clawed hand down upon Modoc and with a single mighty blow sent the wizard flying across the room. Modoc's broken body slammed into the wall and fell to the floor. When the mage gathered enough strength to stand up and the stars cleared from his eyes he saw the Oni's claw clutching tightly Kamali’s lifeless body by the throat. Gorignak rushed frantically to cut down the fiend that had slain their friend. The barbarian’s progress was slowed by the freezing gales, but upon reaching the beast he landed many savage blows, splattering it's black blood throughout the room. A few meters away to Modoc’s right, James kneeled to steady himself as he fired arrow after arrow into the fray. Then, to the wizard's horror, he witnessed to fell creature’s clawed hand reach into Gorignak’s chest. And then retract with the barbarian’s in its grasp. The goliath managed to shrug off the wound just long enough to land one final blow before falling, almost cleaving the Oni’s head form it's body. With it's black blood spewing from many savage wounds the demon summoned it's dying strength. It raised a bloody hand and sent forth a deadly cone of freezing energy in a last attempt to kill the remaining intruders. Only Modoc emerged from the temple. The mage struggled as he drug Kamali’s body into the green light of the Chultan jungle. The forms of his two other fallen friends floated upon a floating disk that followed a few meters behind the wizard."3/30/2018 8:45:34,Josip Broz Tito,Communist ,Rogue/Partisan ,"Josip Broz was born on 7 May 1892 in Kumrovec, a village in the northern Croatian region of Hrvatsko Zagorje which at that time was part of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia within the Austro-Hungarian Empire.He was the seventh or eighth child of Franjo Broz (1860–1936) and Marija née Javer_ek (1864–1918), his parents having already lost a number of children in early infancy. He was christened and raised as a Roman Catholic. His father, Franjo, was a Croat whose family had lived in the village for three centuries, while his mother Marija, was a Slovene from the village of Podsreda. The villages were only 16 kilometres (10 mi) apart, and his parents had been married on 21 January 1891. Franjo Broz had inherited a 4.0-hectare (10-acre) estate and a good house, but he was unable to make a success of farming. Josip spent a significant proportion of his pre-school years living with his maternal grandparents at Podsreda, where he became a favourite of his grandfather Martin Javer_ek, and by the time he returned to Kumrovec to commence school he spoke Slovene better than Croatian, and had learned to play the piano. Despite his mixed parentage, Broz is often referred to as an ethnic Croat.In July 1900, at the age of eight, Broz entered primary school at Kumrovec, but only completed four years of school, failing the 2nd grade then graduating in 1905. As a result of his limited schooling, throughout his life he was poor at spelling. After leaving school, he initially worked for a maternal uncle then on the family farm. In 1907, his father wanted him to emigrate to the United States, but could not raise the money for the voyage. Instead, aged 15 years, Josip left Kumrovec and travelled about 97 kilometres (60 mi) south to Sisak where his cousin Jurica Broz was doing army service. Jurica helped him get a job in a restaurant, but Broz soon tired of that work and approached a Czech locksmith, Nikola Karas, for a three-year apprenticeship, which included training, food, and room and board. As his father could not afford to pay for his work clothing, Josip paid for it himself. Soon after, his younger brother Stjepan also became apprenticed to Karas.During his apprenticeship he was encouraged to mark May Day in 1909, and read and sold Slobodna Re_ (Free Word), a socialist newspaper. After completing his apprenticeship in September 1910, Broz used his contacts to gain employment in Zagreb and at the age of 18 joined the Metal Workers' Union and participated in his first labour protest. He also joined the Social-Democratic Party of Croatia and Slavonia.He returned home in December 1910 and in early 1911 began a series of moves, first seeking work in Ljubljana then Trieste, Kumrovec and Zagreb, where he worked repairing bicycles and joined his first strike action on May Day 1911. After a brief period of work in Ljubljana, between May 1911 and May 1912 he worked in a factory in Kamnik in the Kamnik–Savinja Alps, and when it closed, he was offered redeployment to _enkov in Bohemia. On arriving at his new workplace he discovered that the employer was trying to bring in cheaper labour to replace the local Czech workers, and he and others joined successful strike action to force the employer to back down.Driven by curiosity, Broz then moved to Plze_ where he was briefly employed at the _koda Works, then travelled to Munich in Bavaria. He also worked at the Benz car factory in Mannheim, and visited the Ruhr. By October 1912 he had arrived in Vienna where he stayed with his older brother Martin and his family and worked at the Griedl Works before getting a job at Wiener Neustadt where he worked for Daimler, and was often asked to drive and test the cars. During this time he spent considerable time fencing and dancing, and during his training and early work life he also learned German and passable Czech.In May 1913, Broz was conscripted into the Austro-Hungarian Army, for his compulsory two years of service. He successfully requested that he serve with the 25th Croatian Home Guard (Croatian: Domobran) Regiment garrisoned in Zagreb. After learning to ski during the winter of 1913–1914, he was sent to a school for non-commissioned officers in Budapest, after which he was promoted to sergeant major, and became the youngest of that rank in his regiment. At least one source states that he was also the youngest sergeant major in the Austro-Hungarian Army. After winning the regimental fencing competition, Broz went on to come second in the army fencing championships in Budapest in May 1914.Soon after the outbreak of World War I in 1914, the 25th Croatian Home Guard Regiment marched towards the Serbian border, but Broz was arrested for sedition and imprisoned in the Petrovaradin fortress in present-day Novi Sad. Broz later gave conflicting accounts of this arrest, telling one biographer that he had threatened to desert to the Russians, but also claiming that the whole matter arose from a clerical error. A third version was that he had been overheard saying that he hoped the Austro-Hungarian Empire would be defeated. After his acquittal and release, his regiment served briefly on the Serbian Front before being deployed to the Eastern Front in Galicia in early 1915 to fight against Russia. On one occasion, the scout platoon he commanded went behind the enemy lines and captured 80 Russian soldiers, bringing them back to their own lines alive. In 1980 it was discovered that he had been recommended for an award for gallantry and initiative in reconnaissance and capturing prisoners. On 25 March 1915, he was wounded in the back by a Circassian cavalryman's lance, and captured during a Russian attack near Bukovina. Now a prisoner of war (POW), Broz was transported east to a hospital established in an old monastery in the town of Sviyazhsk on the Volga river near Kazan. During his 13 months in hospital he had bouts of pneumonia and typhus, and learned Russian with the help of two schoolgirls who brought him Russian classics by such authors as Tolstoy and Turgenev to read.After recuperating, in mid-1916 he was transferred to the Ardatov POW camp in the Samara Governorate, where he used his skills to maintain the nearby village grain mill. At the end of the year, he was again transferred, this time to the Kungur POW camp near Perm where the POWs were used as labour to maintain the newly completed Trans-Siberian Railway. Broz was appointed to be in charge of all the POWs in the camp. During this time he became aware that the Red Cross parcels sent to the POWs were being stolen by camp staff. When he complained, he was beaten and put in prison. During the February Revolution, a crowd broke into the prison and returned Broz to the POW camp. A Bolshevik he had met while working on the railway told Broz that his son was working in an engineering works in Petrograd, so, in June 1917, Broz walked out of the unguarded POW camp and hid aboard a goods train bound for that city, where he stayed with his friend's son. The journalist Richard West has suggested that because Broz chose to remain in an unguarded POW camp rather than volunteer to serve with the Yugoslav legions of the Serbian Army, this indicates that he remained loyal to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and undermines his later claim that he and other Croat POWs were excited by the prospect of revolution and looked forward to the overthrow of the empire that ruled them.Less than a month after Broz arrived in Petrograd, the July Days demonstrations broke out, and Broz joined in, coming under fire from government troops. In the aftermath, he tried to flee to Finland in order to make his way to the United States, but was stopped at the border. He was arrested along with other suspected Bolsheviks during the subsequent crackdown by the Russian Provisional Government led by Alexander Kerensky. He was imprisoned in the Peter and Paul Fortress for three weeks, during which he claimed to be an innocent citizen of Perm. When he finally admitted to being an escaped POW, he was to be returned by train to Kungur, but escaped at Yekaterinburg, then caught another train which reached Omsk in Siberia on 8 November after a 3,200-kilometre (2,000 mi) journey. At one point, police searched the train looking for an escaped POW, but were deceived by Broz's fluent Russian.In Omsk the train was stopped by local Bolsheviks who told Broz that Vladimir Lenin had seized control of Petrograd. They recruited him into an International Red Guard which guarded the Trans-Siberian Railway during the winter of 1917–1918. In May 1918, the anti-Bolshevik Czechoslovak Legion wrested control of parts of Siberia from Bolshevik forces, and the Provisional Siberian Government established itself in Omsk, and Broz and his comrades went into hiding. At this time Broz met a beautiful 14-year-old local girl, Pelagija ""Polka"" Belousova, who hid him then helped him escape to a Kyrgyz village 64 kilometres (40 mi) from Omsk. Broz again worked maintaining the local mill until November 1919 when the Red Army recaptured Omsk from White forces loyal to the Provisional All-Russian Government of Alexander Kolchak. He moved back to Omsk and married Belousova in January 1920. At the time of their marriage, Broz was 27 years old and Belousova was 15. In the autumn of 1920 he and his pregnant wife returned to his homeland, first by train to Narva, by ship to Stettin, then by train to Vienna, where they arrived on 20 September. In early October Broz returned home to Kumrovec in what was then the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes to find that his mother had died and his father had moved to Jastrebarsko near Zagreb. Sources differ over whether Broz joined the Communist Party while in Russia, but he stated that the first time he joined the party was in Zagreb after he returned to his homeland."3/30/2018 8:50:57,Constantine,Aasimar,Paladin,"Formerly, His Lordship the Count Augustus of Faircastle, Constantine was born the third son of Count Martin Augustus and enjoyed a sheltered upbringing in the courts of Neverwinter. As the third son it was expected that he would never inherit power and was allowed to pursue his own interests which were generally partying and music.This changed when His father and eldest brother were viciously assassinated in a trade dispute between a rival house. The second eldest brother, Marcus then raised the houses banners and besieged the rival houses castle before meeting them in battle at a nearby ford. He was victorious but suffered grave wounds and died of an infection two weeks later. Constantine was then thrust expectantly and in the wake of tragedy into the position of leadership, being the last living member of the house. Despite this he showed a surprising knack for politics and eventually negotiated a peace treaty ending decades of conflict between the two families and then after burying his family he set about repairing the damage, over the years rebuilding Faircastle into a prospering town. Early into his rule he also married and had four children, two boys and two girls, the eldest of which he named after his father.The decades of peace in Faircastle were shattered in a single night as Drow raiders fell upon the town during the night, slaughtering the guards and abducting many as slaves, before setting fire to the rest on their way out. Amongst the dead, counted Constantine's wife and three children including his eldest. His youngest child, Marcus, was last seen being carried away by a Drow with no hair, half a nose and a long scar from forehead to chin.

After their parents died, they began acting out. They had no inheritance to speak of, and the only thing of value from their parents were the tools of the Guild. After many years of practical jokes and shenanigans while learning how to use their new ""toys"", they wore out there welcome. On the way out of their town, leaving quickly before being caught, they ran across a monk, and a mage that were eager to explore the world. The first town they ended up in together, the brothers tried to use their new skills and horribly failed. They woke a shop owner by knocking items over in his shop, and when they heard him coming down the stairs they panicked and grabbed the nearest thing they could and ran. On realizing that this was Oil flasks, they stopped just long enough to make a flaming oil bomb that they then chucked back into the store. As this was a lantern and candle shop, the results were catastrophic, ending with the first in a line of towns that were burnt to the ground. This was the way of the adventures at first, get somewhere new, and try their thieving abilities , fail, and burn the place to the ground. This became their trade mark, and the rest of their stories are weirder and more macabre, including using a rooster to be an interrogation tool, but that is a story for another day, and not for the faint of heart.  "3/30/2018 13:08:07,Wiggly ,Human,Fighter,"Coming from a wealthy background, but determined to prove his worth, Wiggly took up a sword to start adventuring. His first group was formed rather haphazardly, and included a Half-Elf that initially just wanted to urinate on him. The cleric/leader of the group caught his eye, and was the only thing that kept him from dispatching a few of the party members on a regular basis. The Illusionist/drunk was at times useful but at other times not worth keeping around. a second Half-Elf was more likely to stab you in the back as help you, but was good to keep around in general. The party as it were, went on the monumental task of defeating a horde of evil humanoids set on destroying the world by using a suit that included many special items. This helmet, armor, gauntlets, sword and shield individually were powerful, but as a whole were devastating. In the first few weeks together Wiggly learned a few very powerful lessons. First quit while you are ahead, if the enemy is down, slitting its neck is much better than trying to continue attacking it and losing your weapon in the river. Second, always bring a backup weapon. Third keep less trained fighter/thieving types around, so that there are more targets for the enemies to attack. Last, Clerics are important to have with you, without them you have a high chance of dying."3/30/2018 13:18:28,Jaques,Human,Militant Necromancer,"Hailing from a land that has been at war for longer than anyone can remember, Jaques decided rather than take up the sword and fight for an idiot king, he would pursue adventures that would help him learn more about becoming all knowing and eternal. His hope was to gain enough knowledge so that he could come home and end the war. He found some tomes of an arcane nature that led him to a mage. This mage trained for years to understand all things about the mystical world. In his adventures the mage had gathered spell books from many lost tombs, and research laboratories. Some of these even he could not understand, but the first one that Jaques studied was of a nature that helped in combat. Jaques already familiar with melee combat realized how this specific type of knowledge would help him in his goals. He found his master asleep in his lab one day, and without thinking murdered him with one of his new found tricks. This sent him off the handle, and he tried for days to undo what he had done, but eventually was only able to make his former master a zombie. This is where Jaques decided to continue searching for more knowledge of this type. Being able to create an army from the fallen would come in handy with his task of overtaking his homeland.

He later discovered he had a strange affinity with fire and an unnatural control over the element.3/30/2018 14:19:30,Magnus,Dark-elf,Ninja / Sorcerer,"I was born in a human city whose name I can no longer remember. I lived with my Family; my mother was an elf, a stunningly gorgeous woman with beautiful golden blond hair and deep golden eyes. She was one of the kindest people that I have ever know. My father was in many ways different, he was a devil, a strong sturdy man whose silver hair and flame red eyes drew you to him; despite how he looked he was also extremely kind and he and my mother were completely in love. But that's just what I remember from the few short years that I got to spend with them.For the first few years of my life that I can remember everything was amazing, I spent the days playing with my parents and my dad even taught me some basic magic tricks, he praised me telling me that I had learned them faster than even he did, we spent life as a normal family, or so I thought.When I was only 5 a strange change seemed to come over my parents, we stopped going out as often; when we did I had to wear these strange clothes that didn't fit very well. Then shortly after my 6th birthday my father started to get horns on his head, I was super excited for him they looked really cool, but my father always tried to hide them when we went out; I couldn't understand why. I think it happened about 5 months later that a man came to the door, something was strange though as soon as my father saw him he changed, he was a bit scary and my mother took me to the bedroom where we stayed for what seemed like forever. eventually my father came into the room, my mother put me into the bed and told me to go to sleep; of course after all that had happened I couldn't just go to sleep so I pretended and when my parents had been gone to the front room for a while I snuck up to the door and listened as hard as I could.What I heard didn't make much sense, my mother and father both seemed to be really upset and the only things I understood was that the man who had just come worked for my father's brother. this was news to me I never knew I had more family out there; why had I never met him, why did this man who worked for my uncle make my parents so upset. my mother started to cry for some reason and my father just hugged her, after it started getting mushy I went back to bed and fell asleep.The very next day was a blur, my parents were going in and out of the house all day and told me to stay inside and practice some of my magic tricks; I enjoyed magic so I didn't mind. it was late and I was getting hungry so I asked mother for something, she told me to hold on a moment and then gave me some kind of strange glass. she told me it was a new drink that she had made just for me and wanted me to tell her how it tasted; it tasted strange, first it was like cherry, then honey, then it was some wierd taste that I couldn't figure out but I finished it. I told my mother it tasted great and she gave me the smile that I loved; and my father patted me on the head and told me he loved me.That was the last time I ever saw my father. I woke up in a blurry daze and called out for my mother, she reached over and held my hand petting my hair and asking me to be quiet for a little while. after I had fully woken up I looked at my mother to see tears, and something I had never seen on her face before but that I now understand was fear. I asked where father was and all she would say is not now; the fear seemed to infect me and I sat quietly huddled in my mother's arms finally noticing that we were moving along a bumpy path in what seemed to be a wagon.We stayed like that for a long time, finally my stomach started growling so loud that my mother was able to hear it, she petted my head and handed me a small loaf of bread. it was strange I had never had this kind of bread before it had a strange taste that I couldn't place. my hunger satiated and my fear reduced I became curious again and started to look around. that is when I noticed that we were alone in the wagon and that outside was someplace that looked completely different from where we lived, we were going through a huge forest. since I have always been able to see in the dark I didn't realize at first but it was really pitch black outside and we seemed to be moving at a good pace.I asked my mother what was going on, she looked at me and said, ""you have been asleep for three days, your father was taken; we are going to a hidden place where we will be safe"". it was too much information that didn't make sense all at once; I shut down trying to figure out what was going on from what my mother had said. three days, I had been asleep for three days; and somehow while I was asleep someone or something had taken my father, but who in the world could be strong enough to take my father? it didn't make sense and where was this safe place, safe from who? nothing made sense and I couldn't handle that; I went blank and the next thing I remember was the wagon coming to a abrupt stop and hearing shouting.Coming back to the real world to find your mother in a panic is something that is hard to experience but it was probably the fact that I was till in shock that saved my life, my body took over as my mind reeled at what was happening. my mother grabbed my hand and we both jumped from the wagon, seconds later the wagon exploded behind us throwing us into the trees on the side of the path. my mother stood me up and we raced through the trees, it was still pitch black so my mother was tripping over things here and there, I came back to my senses enough to understand that we needed to run and my mother couldn't see. I took the lead and as we raced through the trees the light started to come back.Once we had a little light my mother took back over and we changed directions a few times, I had no idea where we were or where we were going but my mother seemed like she knew exactly. we ran for what seemed hours and finally I collapsed, my mother tried to get me to go on but everything that had happened had just hit me and I just curled up and wouldn't move. my mother sat next to me, laid my head on her lap and smoothed my hair whispering to me and telling me it would be alright, telling me that I had been brave and that we had gotten away. I calmed down thanks to her and was able to fall asleep on her lap.It was light when I woke up still on my mother's lap, but something was wrong, she was cold not her normal warming presence. she seemed to be asleep, but she wouldn't wake up to my calling her, or when I tried to shake her awake. when I tried to shake her again she fell over and that was when I noticed. the tree that she had been leaning against was covered in blood; but that didn't make sense, why would the tree be covered in blood. when I went over to help my mother up I put my hand on her back but it was wet so I pulled away, now my hand was covered in blood; why was my mothers back covered in blood just like the tree? it came to me slowly as I didn't want to accept it, I fought it but it just kept coming back; it's her blood. by why, why was my mother's blood all over her back and the tree? because she's dead...that thought struck me cold; I knew it but how could I accept it. my mother the kind and beautiful woman that I had known for my entire life, gone.I just sat there, completely locked in the mental battle between my grief and my intellect telling me different things. it was some time later when my intellect started to overcome my grief that I realized I needed to find out where I was. I got up and started looking around, realizing that it was getting dark again. as I looked around I noticed that some of the trees in the direction my mother had been facing looked different, I went over to inspect them. to my horror I found that not only the trees but what appears to have been three elves burnt to a crisp and lying on the ground; what had drawn my attention to this space was all the charring on the surrounding trees. after my stomach expelled what seemed to be nothing by acid, I was starving, thirsty, and still dazed after having seen my first dead bodies ever.I didn't want to leave my mother but I had to find something to eat and drink. luckily one of the magic tricks my father had taught me allowed me to summon a bit of water. I scooped out a hole in the dirt and summoned my magic, I placed a small stone in the center of the hole and called out ""Drench"". this summoned a small torrent of water that drenched the stone and filled the hole. the water was nice on my throat after all of the stomach acid and I drank my fill. now I just needed to figure out how to get some food.When my father first started out teaching me magic he taught me the spell ""Prestidigitation"" telling me to master that and I would be able to get the hang of magic, I never saw a whole lot of uses to the spell since it was mostly to practice summoning my magic but I realized now that it could be of some use, I grabbed some grass and used the spell to flavor it to my liking, it wasn't amazing but it did at least fill my empty stomach. not that I had food and water in me I needed to figure out what to do about my mother. I wanted to figure out what had happened to her, and figure out what to do now.Upon looking at my mother a little longer I realized that she had something clutched in her hand. she seemed to have been hanging onto it when she died. it was pretty hard to open her hand, but I was eventually able to get her hand open and found a piece of paper. on the paper written in what I could only assume was blood was a final message from my mother. ""i am going to die, I have known this ever since you fell asleep, I must have been hit with something when the wagon exploded. I know that your scared and I am sorry that I can't be there for you anymore. I have hidden some magical traps to hopefully stop anyone that comes after you. I feel that I owe you more of an explanation but I fear I don't have time; so to explain as best as I can... your father was forced to return home by his family, you should not go after him, he did this to protect us from his family. we were on our way to a dark-elf haven, a place where there are others such as yourself. we were ambushed by elves looking to learn the location of the haven. burn my body and then you must run, do not trust any elves that you see. I love you.""I must have read that letter five or six times, I didn't understand why elves were after us, my mother was an elf... and why would my father have to leave to protect us from his family, none of this made any sense. the thing that stuck out to me were the last things in the letter, the only things I could make sense of at the moment; run, don't trust elves, and the final words of love from my mother. I folded up the note and put it into my pocket; I hoped I would eventually be able to figure out what the rest of the message was talking about. before I could leave I needed to follow the last thing my mother told me to do, burn her body. I didn't want to say goodbye to her yet but I couldn't just leave her and it was the last thing my mother asked of me. I grabbed some twigs and sticks from around the clearing and put them around my mother, I summoned my magic and cast ""Ignite"" setting flame to the only family that I had. I now was without father or mother and had no idea what to do other that what my mother had told me, so I ran.I ran through the forest completely devoid of a specific direction or purpose, just running. something stopped me dead in my tracks, and it took me a moment to figure out what; it was voices. I crouched down into a bush and stayed as still as I could listening for the voices. it seemed to be three people and from what I could hear of their conversation they were quite agitated. they had lost a few people and couldn't find what they were looking for. it slowly dawned on me that the thing they were looking for was me and mom, and that the people they were missing must have been those bodies I had found. I stayed still not sure what to do, listening to them as they seemed to be coming closer, I just hoped that they wouldn't find me, I didn't think I could fight them.Behind me a twig snapped and the people started coming in my direction at a much swiffer pace crushing leaves and twigs as they came, but I had no idea what had snapped that twig behind me and that thought kept me rooted to my spot in the bush afraid to move. as the people came into view through the bush I saw that they were all three elves, although their anger seemed to make them much less beautiful than mother had been. They slowed as they approached the area where the sound had come from and I was afraid that they would hear my pounding heart through my chest and the bush and know I was here. but it seems they couldn't and they went past my hiding spot and headed farther back. now that they were past me and their backs were turned I felt like I had to get out of there.i snuck out of the bush as quietly as I could and made my way in the opposite direction of the elves. This is where it seems my luck ran out, I was just about out of there when there was a loud noise and I suddenly found myself upside down hanging from some kind of wire around my ankle; I was caught in a trap. the elves whipped around and started running towards me. when they were just in front and below me they started laughing as I struggled in my binding. one of the elves came forward a bit and spat at me just narrowly missing me with my wild swinging. ""So we finally found the little abomination, where is your whore of a mother little devil's spawn."" I screamed my rage at them furious that they would insult me mother so soon after her death. They seemed to find this funny, one of them tossed a rock, hitting me on the head, and I could feel the wound start to bleed. ""tell us where she is or we'll make you bleed even more devil spawn."" the nock to the head sent me over the edge of rage into a sort of calm fury and without even thinking about it I used drench on all three of the elves completely soaking them.This seemed to have really piss them off as one of them pulled their bow and was about to shoot me when the one who first spoke stopped him. ""we need him to tell us where his mother is; shoot him in the leg."" the elf raised his bow and white hot fire shot through my entire body as the arrow pierced my leg. I nearly passed out but managed to remain conscious out of sheer terror and fury. I gritted my teeth and summoned my magic and let loose the most powerful spell I knew ""Jolt"" electricity jumped from my hand and raced towards then elves. the leader threw up a hand hand blocked the spell but it must have surprised him because it deflected towards the one with the bow. as the elf with the bow was still soaked from the “Drench” spell the electricity must have been to much for him as he collapsed twitching on the ground.that was the first time I had ever used my magic on someone else. I felt exhilarated and horrified at the same time, my stomach was in knots and I started to feel light headed; I wasn't sure if it was from pain or if I was running out of magic. the elves were both fumming at the mouths. the leader seemed to be keeping his head and wanted to torture me for information, the other one seemed to have lost it and just wanted to kill me right there. neither future was particularly appealing to me but I couldn't think of any way to get out of this predicament.The elves seemed to come to an agreement about what to do with me, ""if you had just told us where your mother was you could have died together; but your just too much of a pain so were going to kill you first"". crap I had pushed them over the edge and I was out of power, I couldn't concentrate anymore because of the pain in my leg and the blood rushing to my head. the leader stepped back as the other elf brought out a bow and arrow, he brought the bow up and aimed the arrow right at my chest, I was dead, there was nothing I could do. suddenly the leader grabbed his neck and started choking; the elf with the bow turned around to see what had happened to the leader. as the elf turned a flash of black flew across the distance and landed in the elves forehead. both elves collapsed pretty much simultaneously as a tall woman completely covered from head to toe seemed to appear from a tree.I couldn't believe my eyes, both elves were dead and this woman had appeared out of nowhere; was I saved? was I in even more danger? I kept silent hanging from the wire trying to remain conscious. the woman walked over to the elf that I had zapped with magic, bent over and slashed his throat; she then walked over to the elf with the bow and retrieved what appeared to be some kind of pointed black metal star. she flicked the blood from it and then with a flick of her wrist it disappeared. after all of that she looked up at me and asked ""are you afraid?"" I mean what kind of question is that, I was terrified; so I nodded. ""good, that means that you want to live."" I nodded again. ""would you like to get down from there?"" I pointed to my leg with the arrow in it afraid to get down to hard. she nodded and lowered me down gently.""Now, I am going to numb your leg so that we can talk without you passing out from pain."" just after she said that she proceeded to jab my leg in several places with her finger, it hurt at first but the pain receded and I was left with a sense of numbness in most of my body. I thanked her but I was still a bit weary of her, I new she could kill me in a second if I said the wrong thing. ""from what I saw, you put up a pretty good fight for a runt."" she said. I looked up at her and replied ""i just acted on instinct"". she laughed ""people with that kind of instinct can be quite deadly when they grow up."" I just kind of stared at her blankly not really understanding. the looked me over, ""you seem to be a dark elf, though not very old by the looks of it, I assume that's why they were looking for your mother?"" the question didn't seem to make any sense to me ""why would they be looking for my mother because of me?"" I asked. the woman looked at me but as her face was mostly covered I couldn't see what she was thinking ""it seems you are pretty ignorant of the world aren't you?"". that sounded pretty rude but I still didn't want to say the wrong thing so I just nodded. she chuckled ""well at least your able to admit it. now, if you'll tell me where your mother is I can help you find her."" the stress and the fear and the pain of the day started to overwhelm me and I couldn't answer all I could do was cry. I cried for several minutes until I realized that she was just sitting there watching me; not saying anything, not doing anything. for some reason her calmness was calming me down as well; I didn't have the heart to explain what had happened so I reached into my pocket and took out the letter from my mother and handed it to woman.After reading the letter the woman folded it back up and handed it back to me; ""you'll want to keep that I assume"". I thanked her and put the letter back into my pocket. The woman studied me for a moment and then said ""i have two questions for you. first, did you do what your mother asked and burn her body?"" I stared at her for a moment and then nodded that I had. she nodded back ""that must have been hard, but it's good that you did. As for my second question; in the letter it says that you were headed to a safe haven, since this seems to be the first time you have heard of it I will assume that you don't know the location..."" I shook my head that I did not. ""...that being the case my question for you is; what do you want to do?"" this question took me by surprise, how should I know what to do, all I have been doing is running like my mother's letter told me to do. I didn't have my mother or my father, I didn't know where I was, I still didn't understand why elves were after me. I was so confused she seemed to see it on my face; ""think about it for a minute, just calm down and think, what do you want to do be it something now or something in the future."" what did I want to do? there was the question that decided what would happen next, I wasn't being told to do something, I wasn't reacting to crazy things happening. that single fragile handhold of control that one thing that I could decide for myself brought me out of all the things swirling through my head and I could finally come up with an answer for her. ""I want to get stronger!"".And that was how I started living with my master, the woman who would teach me to be a ninja like her. we lived alone in the forest where my mother died, and where I trained under my master for the last 13 years. I am now 19 about to turn twenty and my master says I have learned what I need to stay alive, I need to travel the world and gain experience if I want to keep growing."3/30/2018 14:52:37,Janaan Basha,Tiefling,Bard,"Both of her (human) parents worked as Weaver Guild Artisans, her mother specializing in dying and embroidery; and her father in the design & creation of customized garments.

As a result, Swanhilde grew up extremely vain. One day, an old hag came to visit the castle. She asked for food and help from Swanhilde. Swanhilde's response was essentially ""Ew, gross, go away."" As a result of this rudeness, the hag cursed her to turn into a monster at sunset. When her parents found out about the incident, they banished her from the country."3/30/2018 17:35:13,Konchet Dukhmir,Warforged,Paladin,"(There is a novel version available, but it didn't fit in the response box.  Sad day.) Spirit, a low-level, loyal android and acolyte of the Machine, regularly absorbs the torment of her superiors.  She obeys them without question in order to please the mechanical goddess, but by the word of the Colonel - high priest in the cult's compound - Spirit cannot pray to the Machine.  One day, however, Spirit's friend Klavdiya gives her a prayer card which the goddess is assured to answer.  Spirit uses the card, contritely asking direction only to learn that the leadership in the Machine cult has been filled with lies and deceit.  She begins filling the followers' heads with new interpretations of the Holy User's and Programmer's Manuals, making them suspicious of the Colonel and the other members of leadership.  In the meantime, she continues to fulfill her duties dismembering willing followers and designing cybernetic implants with which to replace them.  While performing her regular job, she happens across the designs for Klavdiya's cybernetic wings and discovers that the Colonel had approved an atrocious failure, likely as punishment for one of Spirit's own small mistakes.  She wants to rescue Klavdiya, but the Colonel throws her in the hot box to stop her, leaving her in until her joint lubricant changes phase and fails.  During her time in jail, the Colonel investigates and discovers her subversion against him, but the rumors have gained enough clout that he needs her in order to combat them.  He removes her from the hot box, declares her 'broken and mentally unstable,' and locks her in her room.  Joints stiff and body painful once she awakes from a period of inactivation, Spirit is still able to escape her room.  She immediately goes to Klavdiya to rescue her, but Klavdiya believes Spirit is broken and doesn't heed her warnings.  The Colonel arrives and arrests Spirit, then takes her to his office where he removes her skin to exchange the joint fluid.  Under pressure and pain, she agrees to do as he asks and tell the congregation that she'd been feeding them lies.  Her skin gone and her body overly sensitive and painful, Spirit again escapes her room, this time going to the forge where Klavdiya's wings are almost complete.  She kills the smith who made the wings and destroys the originals, throwing both into the Machine's blazing forge to burn and melt down.  The next morning, the Colonel brings her in to admit her mistakes to the congregation, but he won't stop at that.  He takes her to the Machine for judgment, but Spirit uses the Machine's logic and announcements to turn the onlooking crowd against him.  She convinces the crowd to turn against the cult leadership, then flays a Lieutenant alive to take a replacement skin.  As the entire compound dives into chaos, Spirit makes her way to finally pull Klavdiya out of the compound.  They ride off into the sunset, satisfied that they will be the last believers of the Machine cult. "3/30/2018 20:17:42,James Terrestris,Worm-man,Ranger,He got turned into a worm.

I find myself chained to a wall in a rank cave, surrounded by stolen goods and goblins.  How did I come to this low state?  I was traveling with a group of pilgrims to the Keep on the Borderlands to pay tribute at the Temple of St Cuthbert of the mace.  I was to then spend some time there preaching to the outlying villages and taking on tasks as needed.We were overrun on the road by a gang of goblins; mean little humanoids of an evil and spiteful nature.  We were brought into some caves that dotted the walls of a ravine set back from the main road.  The goblins talked long and hard about what to do with us.  They didn’t know that I understand their greasy tongue, and I didn’t let on that I did.  We were sorted, and the last I saw of the pilgrims was when some thuggish hobgoblins came and took them away.  They were traded for gold, most likely; sold into slavery. I failed them as a protector.  St. Cuthbert have mercy on them.  The reason I have been spared that fate is that the goblins intend to ransom me to the Temple at the Keep.  They have decided I would fetch a much higher price than what the hobgoblins would pay.  Stripped of my gear, they add insult to injury by putting it close at hand.  The goblins took my underclothes leaving me as vulnerable as a babe.   They would torment me, poking me with sticks.  Some of the more daring ones would touch me with their greasy claws, pinching and prodding.  They never violated me.  The chief would yell at and beat the others, telling them that if they abused me too much the Temple would never pay, and would send a troop of clerics and soldiers to come rescue me.  Their fear of retribution saved me from the worst of their attentions.  These degradations sorely tested my resolve.My Faith never waivered.  When the chief sent an emissary to the Keep to negotiate my release I even extended my prayers to it in the hope that the transaction would be speedy and fruitful.  He never returned.  I still believed.  Obviously that avenue of respite was not to be.  My trial must be a lesson St. Cuthbert needs me to learn.My conditions were squalid.   I was forced to live, eat and sleep in my own filth.  Every so often the goblins would take me away and douse me with freezing water, scrubbing me with stiff bristled brooms.  Even they could not stand the stench as my area would be cleaned and fresh straw lain down. On the last washing I grabbed a piece of cloth that was hanging out of one of the crates and wrapped it around me.  A goblin tried to take it and I hit him so hard I nearly killed him.  They let me have the cloth.  A small victory.After that incident they treated me with a modicum of respect.  It seems violence runs their social system.  I should have figured that out earlier.  Silly me!  They would take me for short walks in order to stretch my legs and preserve my figure.  They didn’t want me to look too wasted when the Temple came for me. I have a pretty good sense of time, even when I can’t see the sun.  By my reckoning it has been a few days over a month I have been in captivity.  I begin to worry that if the Temple does not send word I will be the scapegoat for the goblin’s wrath.  I do not fear death if I had a chance to fight back, but I know these evil little monsters would use and abuse this vessel of St. Cuthbert before they finished me.  After this they would probably sell me to the hobgoblins in order to squeeze the most from me.  I do not relish this prospect and pray fervently for release.There was a large well kept door that the hobgoblins use to enter the goblin caves, and through which they would come and steal from the goblin’s loot that was stored here.  They would stop and leer and whisper lewd comments, but they never touched me.   The goblins would come and be baffled by their losses, looking to me as if I had committed the robbery.  I laughed at their stupidity.  I think the Chief is beginning to realize I speak their tongue.  His common is passable and he would interrogate me about the robberies but I only told him it was St. Cuthbert punishing them for their evil ways.On the eleventh day of my second month of captivity things changed.  The goblins had been restless, riled up like a nest of bees but today they were absolutely rabid.  They were rushing about, shouting about invaders.  Then all was quiet.  No one came with my gruel.  On the twelfth day of my second month of captivity I heard something approaching.  I waited, with some worry I will admit.  My prayers were answered!!  It was a group of adventurers!  They quickly freed me and I donned my gear.  They were respectful and turned away when I dropped my cloth.   When they saw my holy symbol they looked relieved, though they did comment that their last cleric was a female.  This worried me.  They all looked as if they had seen combat, so I laid hands on the dwarf, giving him the blessing of St. Cuthbert.  There was also a human who needed attention so I blessed him as well.None too soon the door opened and four hobgoblins were coming through.  The group sprang into action and the battle was joined!   It was a blur, blows being traded back and forth.  The hobgoblins were able fighters, I will grant them that.  I tried to help, firing my crossbow at the hobgoblins but the action was too furious for me to get a clear shot.  The fight raged, and two of the hobgoblins were down but one ran away.  The remaining hobgoblin hit the monk a serious blow and he fell.  Invoking the might of St. Cuthbert I smote the hobgoblin in the head with my mace, dashing out his brains.  I felt good, some small vengeance having been visited upon the foul creatures.We ran pell mell through the halls, encountering more hobgoblins and fighting our way through.  We ended up in a cave, hobgoblins pelting us with heavy crossbow bolts while their companions tried to cut us down.  Horatio went down in the melee, but I called upon St. Cuthbert to spare him from death.  We recovered the adventurers’ mule and loaded it with Horatio and a goblin that they had captured.  We fled the caves, making for the tree line across the ravine.  Again the hobgoblins rained crossbow bolts upon us.  The tiefling blasted one from existence, but they still brought down the monk.  Three of us carted him to the mule where again I called upon the benevolence of St. Cuthbert to spare him from dying.The journey to the Keep began in earnest.  It was midday when we left the valley so the goblinoids wouldn’t follow, and when night fell it found us quite some distance to the Keep.  It was decided to travel through the night; we could rest when we reached the Keep.  Morning came and the Keep came into view.  Midmorning found us at our destination.  The adventurers turned their captive over to the guards, and I made my way to the Temple.  They were glad to see me, and I was glad for a hot bath and freshly washed clothes.  The head priest fed me and explained the goblin emissary never reached the Keep.  He must have been killed upon the road.Freshly washed and smelling pretty, I found my new friends at the tavern.  They gave me some money, claiming I had taken part in the adventure.  I refused a portion, stating that I was not a part of their group at that point and thus did not deserve it.  I donated a large amount of my new wealth to the Temple.There were rumors abounding about bandits and the valley.  While at the Temple ministering to the needy I was given some information.  A sell sword told me that he had heard there were bugbears in the caves, and that they were afraid of dwarves.  I found this information to be most helpful.  We had a dwarf!  A weapon against the forces of evil!  It was truly a blessing from St. Cuthbert.  I told some of the others when I saw them.  Then it was provisioning and off to the valley again.We stopped at the Tor, a large hill that I recall passing during our flight to the Keep.  Camp was set up on top and we arranged for watches.  I drew the middle of the night.  As Fate would have it during watch we heard a loud whooshing, as if something large were flapping its wings.  The dwarf began waking the party and I got a look at what was coming.  It was huge.  Majestic.  Body of a horse and head of an eagle; a Hippogriff!  I was stunned.  Unfortunately, the suddenness of its appearance and the time of night caused my companions to react out of habit.  The monk struck fiercely but Tor Eastblade dealt horrific damage with his halberd, striking with both blade and haft.  The beast went down.  I cried out, and then began to weep openly for the loss of such a beautiful animal.  The tiefling cried out to heal it, so I called upon St. Cuthbert and was able to stop it’s descent into death.  Then I let the power of my God flow through me, healing the animal.  I sat there, stroking its magnificent head and whispering.  It began to make some purring cooing noises and then its eyes snapped open.  There was a long moment when our eyes met.  I continued to stroke it.  It was softer than it looked.  I continued to coo reassuringly to it.  It stood suddenly, startling me.  The group was looking on with caution.  I stood and continued to whisper and coo to it.  It glared balefully at the monk and Tor, and took a step forward.  I was facing it and it was now pressing hard against me.  I wrapped my arms around its neck and continued to pet it, then turned and scolded the two, using harsh words and shaking my finger at them.  This was a tense moment.  I continued to pet and whisper to it, gently pushing back.  It huffed though its nostrils and took a step back, shaking its head and looking down at me.  The Hippogriff then leapt into the air, its wings whooshing deeply as it rose into the night, finally disappearing into the darkness.I sat by the fire, too excited to sleep, and my mind wandered back to my childhood.  I remembered being filled with an energy, a restless energy that always had me moving.  I was a middle child of a large family, destined to be married off for the dowry.  I loved being outdoors.  I was given the chore of looking for berries, herbs and nuts and I loved being outdoors.  As the years went by I learned to hunt small game and fish, to skin and tan hides.  I began spending more time outdoors than indoors and that suited me just fine.  I didn’t dislike my family, I just liked being outdoors. The more time I spent in the woods, the more an arranged marriage became less appealing.  To have to marry someone I didn’t know and give up my life outdoors was unthinkable.  I didn’t want to become a brood mare for some farm boy.  Plus, I never really got along well with others.  People just made me nervous.  So I left.  I packed up my kit and left and went into the woods.  I left a note so my family wouldn’t worry.  I spent the better part of a year out alone in the woods when I discovered I really did like people.  Not all the time, but I did want some contact so I became a guide.  I travelled the woods, guiding hunting parties and trappers and pilgrims.  I learned so much, so many different languages.  You had to know a lot to get by.  I was guiding a party of pilgrims when my conversion happened.  We were attacked by a band of kobolds.  The little bastards were everywhere, swarming us like ants.  Something came over me, a strength and a feeling as if I couldn’t be hurt.  I waded into the gang of kobolds, swinging my mace like a scythe and cutting them down.  It felt like time slowed and I was able to change my strikes mid swing, staving in skulls and crushing ribs.  Then it was over.  The kobolds were all killed and the pilgrims only suffered minor wounds.  It was a miracle.  I looked at the banner that the pilgrims carried and it was St. Cuthbert of the Mace.  I followed them to the Temple and joined the Order.I loved the Order!  I was allowed to spend time alone, but also spend time with people.  I learned more things, more languages.  My combat training was formalized and I was able to tap into the Grace of St. Cuthbert which allowed me to do wondrous things.  I continued to guide for the Order, and was finally tasked to a smaller Temple out in the Borderlands.  And that is where my tale begins. I sat, staring into the fire.  I watched the flames dance, and when the wind blew the coals flickered and glowed a whitish gray.  It hypnotized me, and I thought back again.  I thought about something that had vexed me for quite some time.  It was a vision I had had since I was a little girl.  In it I am standing near a fire, or a brazier.  Shadows are cast on cavern walls, dancing to the whim of the flames.  I am clothed in silken robes, with beautiful stitching of deepest blue.  My hands encircle my stomach, and I am great with child.  I have had this vision many times.  It is in part responsible for my flight from my family, but I had it when I was alone in the wilderness.  I had the vision when I was a guide, and even when I became a cleric of St. Cuthbert.  That puzzled me.  Why would I have a child while serving St. Cuthbert?  It made no sense to me.  But the vision was still there, frequent enough to give me pause and examine my life.  I was supposed to become pregnant.  Could it be St. Cuthbert calling to me all these years?  Was I supposed to raise a child in the Temple?  Questions I could not answer, and so left them to the flames.		"3/31/2018 14:54:49,Dandee Lyonn,Forest Gnome,Ranger,"Dandee was raised in a nomadic clan of the Valwins.

She started showing signs of being gifted with magic, even as a baby. However, by the time she was only 4, she could no longer control the magic, as it welled up inside her, exploding outwards with deadly consequences. Her family did what they thought best - bundled her up and sent her to the big city to learn to control her magic. On the way to the city, the caravan was ambushed. In fear, Lunilla ran into the forest, wandering for days, magic erupting at odd times. It was in that half-starved, semi-lucid state that she met ""IT"". ""IT"" was the arch-fey, and in return for service, sheltered and raised the young gnome child. However, spending her formative years with none but the arch-fey for company was not great for her mental stability. She is completely unaware of societal norms, manners and social customs. Her name was lost to time, as the arch-fey did not accept her naming as Lunilla (as all true names hold power, and this name does not. In time, she accepted herself as the nameless one). More than a little mad, at 16, she is adventuring to find an object of great importance for ""IT"", making friends (be they friendly or monstrous, she doesn't mind) along the way.

"4/3/2018 1:38:59,"Fergo ""Fern"" Ambercrown",Gnome,Wizard,"Childhood	Fern grew up in the small Gnomish village of Vermont, in the forested Winterwall mountains, north of the Azure Kingdom of Merral. He always had a knack for illusion, growing much faster into his racial illusory traits than other Gnomish children. He would use these Minor Illusions to play tricks on his parents, the village elders, the other children, and any traveller that happened to be passing through. One of these travellers, the royal mage Darvin Shawl, noticed to Fern’s blooming talents and invited him to the royal academy in the Merralian capital of Seastead. Fern, eager to learn, packed up his bags and left the next day.	At the academy, Fern’s raw ability started to become more refined, and his desire for mischief transformed into one for mystery. If he saw an open tome or an unsolved arcane formula, he would not rest until he solved it. His drive to truly test himself eventually clashed with the Academy's systematic style of learning and testing, so, anxious to keep moving forward and unaware of the dangers of the real world, Fern asked to take some time off so he could examine the nature of illusions outside of a controlled environment like the Academy.Adventures with the SparksThe Sparks met in the classic way: sitting around a tavern table, hired to retrieve a certain artifact from a dungeon. Fern started out as aloof from the rest of the group, even actively disliking some. He didn’t get along particularly well with the criminal Romero, he was appalled by the fiendish pact made by Enna, he was shocked by the fiendish appearance of Kallista, and he didn’t care for the divine magic of Torinn. Over the course of the dungeon crawl, however, Fern became friends with the Sparks, becoming especially close with Enna. Over the course of the next 8 years, the Sparks became stronger and closer, gaining recognition and reputation along the way They battled demons, devils, vampires, and beholders. They traveled to the Feywild and back (Romero and Kallista don’t remember that bit). They even faced down and slew an adult green dragon who was plotting to overthrow the King of Merral, Andor of House Paravage. They were thanked personally by the King, his wife Queen Luisa, and his daughter Princess Selise. About this time, Fern and Enna began to fall in love. However, the group was soon pulled separate ways, each with his or her own reason for leaving. Fern’s was the passing of his mentor Darvin. Back at the Academy	In a letter delivered after the funeral, Darvin urged Fern to carry on his work on the nature of the universe, determining the nature of illusion and reality, the difference between shadow matter and true matter, and whether or not their entire existence and universe was just an illusion, a simulated existence by some greater arcane being. So, Fern returned to the Academy and began researching. After years of research, both successful and not, Fern began to rise in the ranks of the mages, eventually becoming a right-hand advisor of the King. One day, King Andor received a dire message from Torrin, a warning of invasion from the Shadowfell. A massive portal had opened in the East, and the undead army of the Umbral Empire was marching into the Material Plane, spearheaded by the Death Cleric Emperor Vorrik and the Necromancer Empress Sylvia, both followers of the Ascended Lich Vecna.The Final PreparationThe Sparks reunited to face this monumental threat and were renamed by King Andor to the Guardians of the Hearth. They travelled across the land and even into some of the other planes to gather allies in their fight. Along the way, they met a Djinni who offered the five one wish each. The Sparks, not necessarily the wisest bunch of people, accepted. These five wishes would be twisted and turned against their makers, and they would eventually lead to Fern’s aversion to free-form Wish spells (none of the adverse effects of these wishes but Fern’s are noticed until later).  Romero, who had fallen in love with Princess Selise and had grown up in absolute poverty, wished to become a prince (think Aladdin); his wish was granted, and his history and family was rewritten to become the son of Vorrik and Sylvia, and heir to an empire of the dead. Kallista, whose diabolic appearance had been rebuked by all she met, wished to be loved and respected; the djinni placed a curse on her that compelled those around her to adore her unnaturally (creepily so). Enna wished that after the threat of the invasion was dealt with, the pact binding her to her fiendish patron would be broken. Torinn, righteous and focus, wished for a weapon that would help destroy followers of Vecna; he received the Sword of Kas and was eventually possessed by it, the dormant spirit of the Betrayer tearing apart his soul and seizing the body for his own. Fern, last to go and remembering his mentor’s dying wish, wished for the answer to a simple question: “Are we real?”. The sheer volume of knowledge from that answer destroyed his mind, killing him. Thankfully, Torinn cast Revivify and Kallista cast Modify Memory to erase the answer from his mind, but Fern is still haunted by images and experiences that he doesn’t understand.The War of the Damned	Fern, Enna, and Torinn (now Kas) met the Umbral army head-on in a battle just outside of the capital, leading their army of the living against the hoards of undead, while Romero and Kallista infiltrated the Shadowfell to locate the clones of the Emperor and Empress. After killing tides of zombies, skeletons, and shadows; undead giants; a shadow dragon; and a death tyrant; the three in the material plane eventually slew the leaders of the undead army, and the two in the Shadowfell destroyed the clones.	At the battle’s end, when Fern confronted Torinn about his new Oathbreaker Paladin abilities and personality, Torinn revealed himself as Kas and killed the spell-spent Fern while the now-powerless Enna watched. He taunted the King, promising that he’d be back, and then teleported away using the Helm of Teleportation.AftermathFern makes his way back to the kingdom after recuperating and resetting his clone. The remaining four Sparks are commended and thanked for their actions. They are then left to pursue their own courses of action over the next two years. Romero, now technically the Emperor of the Umbral empire, is left to deal with everything that the title brings and tries to set up good relations with the Kingdom of Merral and its Princess. Kallista goes off by herself, trying to find clues on the whereabouts of Kas and seeking comfort in isolation due to her curse. Enna sets up an adventurer’s guild in Merral, using her experience to guide the next generation of heroes. Fern returns to the Academy, perfecting his knowledge of the arcane to rise to the rank of Archmage. It’s the ceremony, everyone’s there, he’s walking up to center stage when . . . "4/3/2018 1:40:17,Temur Amblecrown,Half-elf,Bard," Every hero needs a villain. Temur Amblecrown noticed this truth in every single fae tale he read in his childhood, and he wanted nothing more than to be as renowned and admired as those heroes in legend. However, he was anything but. Even as a half-elven child growing up in a primarily human city, he attracted little attention, always sort of fading into the background despite his best efforts. He didn’t have the makings of an underdog either – his human father, Randal Amblecrown, and his elven mother, Mialée Holimion Amblecrown, were caring, supporting, and fairly wealthy. He was encouraged to pursue his musical talents and join the ranks of the prestigious (insert human city name here) orchestra. And he did. But Temur wasn’t happy with being just another note in the chord. He wanted to stand out, be noticed, have thousands of people chanting his name. He left his classical position, but he still faced a problem. But with such a vanilla and unopposed story, he would not catch anybody’s attention. So he decided to create his own arch-nemesis. He created Mindartis Anastacia, a High Elven musician whose incredible talent with the violin was matched by his arrogant and pretentious attitude. This elf viewed himself as above the people, gracing them with a gift of superior music. So some nights Temur would go out as Mindartis, visiting taverns, playing his violin, singing Elven songs of mythology, and just being a general snob. Other nights Temur would go out as himself, visiting the same taverns, playing his lute, singing rowdy songs in Common, and generally presenting himself as a humble hero of the people."4/3/2018 8:55:11,Aven,Tiefling,Warlock,"The tragic history of young Aven TibibAven was abducted by Raptic Elves at age five. She remembers little of that night, besides fire and the lamentations of the dying. Her memories of her Tiefling life are hazy. She dimly remembers her mother’s face, the warmth of her arms, and scraps of stories. She was taken to Faiontis on the island of Abaivoi, and sold to an ancient, skilled and highly respected Cnila-Barmoi warlock named Presbutermen of clan Trinepsios. He was brilliant, wholly devoted to uncovering demonic mysteries, and not much interested in Raptic politics or clan competition. Aven was her Tiefling name. The warlock gave her the name Tibib to be used in his household, in the language of his people. Some in the household treated her kindly, some indifferently. Even Presbutermen was kind in his way. But his fondness for the girl did not prevent him in any way from using her for his dark ends. To summon and bind a Demon, one must make an offering or a bargain. Offerings of pain and death are far safer than actual bargains. Demons can be as tricky as the Fey, and contracts with them easily result in catastrophe. Aven Tibib was subjected to unspeakable tortures. She was tattooed, bled and cut, as binding spells and the blood-thirst of Demons required. Her body is crisscrossed with scars, under layers of ritual tattoo.She soon learned that escape without help was impossible. Her quick mind served her well, as she took in the ways of these strange people. And her strong spirit never broke. She observed Presbutermen keenly, at first simply to anticipate his moods and survive. Over time, as her intellect matured, she surreptitiously learned all she could about the dark arts, for she saw that such knowledge was the highest currency of the Raptics. The household bound and used many Demons. The greatest of them was Piadph’Bab, bound centuries earlier by Presbutermen. The Demon was said to be one of the 9,099. It was, by far, the household’s greatest treasure and in no small measure accounted for their high status. Presbutermen had one child, a son named Melomen, only a few years older than Tibib. He was turning out to be a disappointment to his father. The boy was kind and strong and happy, but not particularly clever. He showed little interest (and no aptitude) for pursuing his father’s studies. Tibib and Melomen grew up and played together, becoming close. Some servants and family members tolerated it, but the pair had to be secretive around most of the household. Their love for each other was real, and as they began to mature, they fell in love—a state of affairs it was imperative to keep secret. When Tibib became pregnant, they both panicked. As a virgin, she was especially useful to Presbutermen. Demons do love virgin’s pain after all. They feared the worst were he to find out. Surely, she and her unborn child would be sacrificed or worse. Melomen too risked death. By this time, Tibib knew her way around a summoning circle and had mastered the most basic elements of demonology. Without Melomen’s knowledge, she struck a bargain with Piadph’Bab. Presbutermen had inscribed a sigil containing the Demon’s real name on the tanned skin of a Tiefling high priestess, given him by the Archmage Petroclaeus after the storming of Abaivoi. The sigil was the instrument of the Demon’s bondage. Through deception, she used Melomen to gain access to the sigil. She then followed the Demon’s instructions as it led her through ritual incantations to free it from bondage to Presbutermen. She cared not what havoc and revenge the Demon might wreak on the household. She deeply regretted leaving Melomen behind, and feared what might befall him. But the safety of her child was paramount. She knew her lover would not go along with un-binding the Demon, as that would have been the utmost betrayal of his father and clan. Piadph’Bab honored its obligations and guided her to safety off the island. Hidden in a merchant vessel, she went to Dis, whereupon she tried her best to blend in as an ordinary Tiefling of Dis. Her scarification and tattoos rendered this difficult, as it did not take much knowledge of arcane arts to divine what she had been used for. Attracting too much attention for comfort, she soon took to hiding herself in cellars and drainage ditches, eventually to be found by a Nun of Kibeth who provided shelter in a convent. Certain that Raptic pirates were on the hunt for her recapture, Aven’s overriding priority was to leave Dis as soon as possible, and to seek safety somewhere inland far from seas she imagined to be swarming with Elves. Aven is fanatically devoted to the baby and will place its survival above all others, including theoretically her own, were such a choice necessary. She would see the whole world burn if it meant survival for the child. She is also strongly motivated by revenge against Presbutermen and the Raptics as a whole, but fears a return to their lands. She endeavors to honor debts and obligations, and is willing to reciprocate loyalty. But she is slow to trust, and there is no trust she would not break to keep herself and the baby alive. No person, however good or dear, she would not harm or betray, if necessary. The honor, respect and fondness she feels for others is genuine… once earned. However, she is reflexively distrustful and secretive. The opinions of others matter little to her in the grand scheme of things, beyond the practical advantages to how one is perceived. That is, she does not base her feelings about herself on those of others. To appear, for example, dishonorable to others would be of little emotional consequence to her. Piadph’BabLike all Demons, there is not an iota of mercy, compassion or fondness in Piadph’Bab. Regard and respect… sure. Being Lawful, it is scrupulous in its agreements and contracts, and unforgiving with others in demanding that which they promise. Were it a Chaotic Demon, it could not have served as long or well for the clan. It was a being they could compel to serve, with ongoing vigilance, but without continuous struggle merely to contain it-- a reliable (though unwilling) servant, rather than a caged beast. It loathes Presbutermen and surely seeks vengeance before returning to the Void. But it acknowledges and respects the warlock’s power, especially the skill required to deprive it of freedom for so long. For reasons beyond Aven’s understanding, Piadph’Bab is not yet free to depart the Firmament. A mishmash of Greek, Enochian and Hebrew and their meanings: Aven Tibib-- wickedness, sorrowfulPiadph'Bab-- in the jaws of possibility Presbutermen-- the elder moonMelomen-- music of the moons Trinepsios—three cousinsPetroclaeus-- the stone that is broken"4/3/2018 9:51:52,Credian,Human,Fighter,"This is the backstory of two brothers. Aquilonian by nation of birth, but by upbringing and bloodline, they are as much Gundermen and Brythunian as they are Aquilonian.They grew up in a rural village in the north of Aquilonia, under the rule of Lord Haestius. His lands were close enough to Cimmeria to be within range of the occasional raid, but far enough south of the border to not have to live in a constant state of alert. Haestius was felt to be a good lord by his subjects, not unduly taking advantage of his title and complete control over the fiefdom.His landholdings were not large, comprising a couple small villages and numerous outlying homesteads. The dominant bloodline of the inhabitants was Aquilonian (Haestius’s line was purported to be as “pure” as such things can be), though many had over time mixed blood with Gundermen, and to a lesser extent mixed by force with Cimmerians and the savages of the Border Kingdoms.One villager in particular stood out ethnically from the others-- a Gunderman iron smith named Eilulf, who had come to the village many years before as a young man, alone and without resources, but already sufficiently skilled in his craft to surpass any other smith in the land. In short order he became well-established and respected in the community, and as wealthy as a craftsman in the village could become according to his station.Eilulf was a powerful, stocky man with gloomy grey eyes. He was prone to bouts of moodiness, as well as of furious productivity. He was brave, strong and level-headed and earned a spot as a village Elder despite not having historic blood ties to the land. For years, he lived and worked alone, until one day a beautiful bride, the likes of which no one had ever beheld arrived for him.No one ever figured out how Eilulf managed to wed an elegant beauty like Raeburn. It was said she came from Brythunia, and she arrived mysteriously at the village at dawn without entourage. It was a wonder that such as she could have made safe passage alone without becoming someone’s concubine across a few leagues journey, let alone the hundreds she would have had to cross from Brythunia. Her dark features, huge saucer-like brown eyes and alien raiment were certainly not native. She could not have been a slave delivered, as she was, alone, nor did she have the broken manner of a slave or a used woman. She was not a woman to be bought or sold, and the villagers soon found her to exhibit a fierce independence and will that seemed to match that of Eilulf.Raeburn more or less adapted to the lifestyle, clothing, etc. of rural Aquilonians, with some notable exceptions. Out of the house she wore the long coverings befitting a peasant Aqualonian woman. Occasionally a passerby might catch a glimpse of her through a window, scantily and exotically dressed like women of the far east, and draped luxuriously like a cat in Eilulf’s home. Many in the land were envious of his domestic bounty.Raeburn was also exceptional in that she could read quite well and write a bit too. Eilulf was one of the only Elders who could read even a little bit, and he could do no more writing than make his mark. Raeburn was the only truly literate person for some distance, other than Lord Haestius himself. The two would sometimes converse, almost as equals, and they took pleasure in the company of another who had some familiarity with genuine refinement.Eilulf and Raeburn lived happily and with passion, but she never conceived, even after many years. As time passed Raeburn increasingly felt the pull of motherhood. It was unthinkable that she could have been anything other than sublimely fecund, and the couple naturally came to wonder whether Eilulf was incapable of planting his seed in her. [He had had a bout of mumps as an adult, leaving him sterile.]After much consideration Raeburn begged Eilulf to permit her to lay with Haestius, as the only other man around she would bear to have touch her. He initially responded with hurt and anger, but over time and with much pleading Eilulf submitted to her will. He was ultimately unwilling to deny her so essential a desire.So Raeburn lay with Haestius and conceived a son, whom she named Beatian. Not in spite did she give their son an Aquilonean name, nor did she ever blame him for his inability to plant seed. Her devotion and affection for her husband only increased with motherhood. Eilulf did wonder though if she had lost some respect for him as a man, and whether (over his objections) she had named the boy by the blood of the father to make some kind of point. At first he insisted the boy at least be called Beatian son of Eilulf after the fashion of a Gunderman, but over time that ceased to be a point of redemption and instead came to feel like a mockery and the son became known simply as Beatian.After conceiving, Raeburn curtailed her friendship with Haestius, though from time to time they came together. He, in turn, made himself busy elsewhere for he had come to love her and it pained him to have her belong to another. He sometimes considered eliminating Eilulf and taking her as his own, as was certainly in his material power to do.  But, he was basically a good man, and he also knew she would never forgive such an act. Instead he ever after found himself patrolling the borders of his land or otherwise drawn away for long periods from his manor. Two years later, she conceived a second and final child by him, a boy who she named Credian.Eilulf was devoted to his sons and loved them dearly. He could not bring himself to become too close to them however and there was always a distance between them. He was stern and quite harsh with them at times, especially when they disappointed or failed to live up to their duties and his expectations of excellence. They seemed not to notice their father’s distance however, and exhibited the confident and easy-going manner of their mother even from a young age. They grew up to be quick-witted and bright, and most competent at that which was of interest to them. They were powerfully built and stocky, with grey Hyborian eyes and the dark complexion of their mother.Beatian’s interests mirrored his mother’s in most respects.  He learned to read and make letters early. He deflected with ease his father’s attempts to teach him smithing and warcraft. Instead he took a keen (but objective and personally uninvolved) interest in people and in nature, and went through life seemingly unconcerned with the social order or opinions of others.For Credian’s part, he was more his father’s son and learned some of Eilulf’s craft. Credian was more boyish and tougher than his older brother, and quicker to anger. He often compensated for his brother’s carelessness and naiveté, extracting them frequently from close scrapes with danger.The boys had little contact with Haestius beyond that which naturally occurred in the village between lord and subject. Haestius would have seen they were well provided for, but that was unnecessary as Eilulf could supply all they required. In time though when the boys came of age, Haestius surreptitiously used his influence on their behalf-- first to pave the way for Beatian to study and apprentice with scholars in Tarentia, and then to place Credian as a Captain’s runner in a heavy foot company.Beatian loved the city, with all its amusements and energy. He did not dive into the lifeblood of the city, instead preferring to observe and soak it all in. He studied letters further and stole into libraries as often as he could. In time, he came across a Stygian sorcerer and became deeply infatuated with the arcane. The Stygian was a cruel master and treated his students terribly but Beatian weathered the abuse with apparent unconcern. He slept little, devoting all his time to his studies and to walks in the busiest bazaars and quarters of the city at all times of day and night.His family did not hear from him much in these years, nor did he travel back home. His mother received a letter once or twice a year. She would joyously read her son’s excited and witty descriptions of city life to her husband, who would frown in disapproval at the impracticality of book learning, though he secretly admired his son’s fearlessness and independence.Then they stopped receiving letters. A year went by without any reply to their inquiries.  Then two years. Eilulf traveled to the capital after three years had elapsed, only to hear from the Stygian that his student had disappeared one day and hadn’t been seen since."4/3/2018 10:25:04,Rexxie,human,bard,"She grew up on a farm in a rural area and learned to play the fiddle as a young child.

Tribe Thuliaga was a small tribe of Goliath, eking out a lonely existence in The Iron-Wyrm Peaks (translated into Common from Giant), with at most 35 members, mainly the descendants of an ancient and heroic and Goliath warlord. There had not been a new child born in 13 years – Aukan and his twin sister, Vaunea were a glimmer of hope.Aukan’s mother died in childbirth.Aukan was a dutiful child, working hard to support his tribe as best he could. As a nimble youth he scouted and snuck, hunting for food. At the tender age of 12 he killed a bear whilst hunting alone in the lowlands, earning the nickname of “Bearkiller” from his chieftain. Vaunea however broke under the pressure, as much as a goliath can at least. Vaunea left the tribe at the age of 15, running away during the tribes visit to a low-land temple-town to trade. The chieftain declared her exiled and forbade mention of her name.She was the second death Aukan knew. Over the next 12 years Aukan’s tribe died around him.

Others died in odd accidents – bridges breaking, cliffs collapsing. The clan chief spoke of a curse, and took with her the last seven other goliaths, to fight the Iron-Wyrm who ruled these peaks, convinced that the beast was responsible for the curse. She begged Aukan to come, to remove the dishonour his sister had brought. Aukan remained.And then there was one.The last of his tribe, Aukan went to the lowlands seeking his long lost sister. Instead he found a strange land with strange customs. Aukan learnt the common tongue from a dwarf clan, and set out into the world to find himself, and bring honour to his tribe.

Roaming the planes, putting fiends in their place, doing crazy magic experiments. But he was born the son of nameless dirt farmers in a forgotten corner of the world. He lived his dreary life day by day, until one of those days when he was still very young, an old man came to his home seeking shelter. He was welcomed in, and offered a place to sleep. Come morning, the young Wizlor (birth name unknown) found the man dead where he slept, and found something in the old man's possessions: a strange book.At first he thought it the ramblings of a madman, or perhaps a coded journal, but with nothing else to do and an inquiring mind, he set himself to uncover the secrets of this tome. After whatever time of studying, he finally deciphered some of the runes and scribbles, tirelessly working to reverse engineer the process that laid them down on the page. Muttering the old words and miming the gestures to no effect for hours, he almost lost hope when, in the wee hours of the night, a spark flung from his fingertips. This spark ignited another in the boy, and he took even more feverishly to his studies. Perhaps too much so, because he was soon caught in the act by his parents. Accused of devilry, he was cast from his home and set on a long journey that would take him farther than he could ever imagine.His journey learning magic is largely unparticulared, but on the way, I assure you, many zany things happened. I want to flesh this part out but haven't yet. At some point he was discovered by the man who would become his mentor. Or perhaps he already was, for this man was the sage Alcaran, Archmage of Time and the only practitioner of chronomancy known to the world. After some no doubt impressive stunt, Alcaran took Wizlor (who had likely taken that name on by that point) to the wizard nation of Are Lyvinzia. Almost entirely populated by wizards, and warded from outside detection and invasion by uncountable wards, Are Lyvinzia was a mage's paradise. There, Wizlor enrolled in the Academa Vinificta, where wizards of all schools toiled to further the arcane science, and where many wacky things happened.He met his roommate Yeran, the grumpy scholar with a penchant for excessive sexual experimentation, took part in many goofy pranks, and also important school stuff. And let's not forget the names. Ever since he had taken off to see the world Wizlor had been adding titles and names to his own. He was maybe a little self-absorbed.Then, after perhaps 20 years spent in Are Lyvinzia, something happened that was not in the slightest goofy or zany. Archmage Alcaran disappeared, along with his tower. Nobody knew exactly how or why, but they figured it had to do with his studies. Alcaran was known to appear and reappear in multiple occasions at varying ages. Chronomancy is an inherently unstable practice, it turns out. He was said to have been working on something especially risky when he disappeared, but what exactly isn't knownDistraught at his mentor's disappearance, Wizlor almost immediately set out to find him, and so began his second sojourn. He searched for a long, long, long time, had so many adventures along the way, enough for multiple lifetimes. But no matter all the friends and enemies he made, all the people saved or ruined, he could never find the man who made him who he was. Only once was Alcaran ever spotted, in the desert land of Salkhoro, by another Archmage.Eventually, even Wizlor gave up hope of finding him. He found meaning in his life through his own adventures. He grew to be a powerful wizard in his own right. Roaming the planes for new sights, righting cosmic wrongs, when he came into contact with a Pit Fiend by the name of Guziel. Wizlor thought this just another villain to vanquish, cocky he had become. But as Wizlor thought he had the upper hand, that he had tricked the fiend, Guziel pulled the rug out from under him. He struck the wizard down, and stole everything from him. His spellbook, his names, his powers. Wizlor was left wandering, aimless, trying to figure out what had gone wrong.Some time after he had regained a measure of power, he joined forces with Die Arschloch (the party) to stop the Dead God Izhothu's shards from being brought together and ending the world. A quest more closely tied to him than he could have thought, he would soon find out, when Alcaran appeared to him, seemingly having found a way to temporarily return to this world or timeline."4/3/2018 15:19:58,Lucrezia Violante del Faustina,Human,Warlock,"The 3rd daughter of the 2nd cousin of a wealthy noble, Lucrezia expected not to inherit the title. Indeed, upon her 18th birthday, she was thrust upon the world with nothing but her good name.... and two thousand gold pieces as capital. Using her cunning business sense, she soon built up a powerful trade and customs network in the port city of Athkatla, and within ten years she was one of the most prominent shakers and movers in the kingdom. One may not hold Lucrezia well, but one never forgot to invite her to their social functions. Little did anyone know (but, later, little was anyone surprised) that Lucrezia was spending her wealth on dark research, and against city law she made a pact with a Deep One. If she could build such power on wealth alone, why, imagine what she could build with the secrets of those pretending to be gods - would she not triumph over them all and become one herself? However, her dark dealings also set her upon a path of paranoia and secrets, so that by the time the courts came to arrest Lucrezia for embezzlement, she shocked them all by burning down her mansion, setting curses upon anyone who'd dare touch her, and generally being a nuisance until a team of specialized wizards successfully captured her. She has since, in a fit of nervous breakdowns, cut her hair, renounced her name to become Violante, and plotted her ascension to godhood with more fervor than ever."4/3/2018 15:37:04,Peatrice Boddynocks,Gnome,Monk,"Peatrice was surrendered to a monastery because her parents had seven other children and she was the loudest. Perhaps, they thought as they walked away with not a little trepidation, a monastery would raise her to be a child of meditation and peace. They were wrong. Though the abbot tried his best to rein in her rowdiness by assigning several more hours of deep meditation than other monks, all it did was foster a sense of injustice and indignation in the young girl. Eventually, it was discovered that the child did actually settle down in learning to brew beer, and Peat threw herself into learning all the workings of the monastery's tradition. However, a very small incident involving a young rival boy, three of the monastery's stills, and the last head of cheese from the season caused the abbot to realise that perhaps the best life's course for the young gnome would be to send her upon a quest to discover better beer ingredients - and become someone *else's* problem."4/3/2018 20:32:54,Millward C.P.A,Dwarf,Paladin,"After working as a civil servant for over 200 years and never taking a vacation day, the city's policy changed, forcing Millward to take all his vacation days at once."4/3/2018 20:35:01,Salveck,Lizardfolk,Ranger,"His tribe was visited by a wise man who told Salvecks people to go out in the world and find their purpose.

They ended up settling down in Waterdeep, where Alyzara was born. She noticed that she and her parents were treated with distrust and hostility, and that sparked a desire to do good for people rejected by society, and started looking into tomes of dark secrets for that purpose. That would be when she was approached by her patron, an angel, and given her powers. She then spent a long time traveling with an adventuring party, but as the rest of the party were all shorter-lived folk, they reached the age where they had to retire, and Alyzara decided to retire as well. During those adventuring days, she met a human woman named Clara, a farmer, after the party saved her village from gnolls. The two hit it off instantly and Alyzara made a lot of excuses to visit her when the party had any downtime. After retiring, she and Clara were married, and lived together on Clara's farm, with their two adopted children. After about ten years, though, a new crisis appeared in the world, and Alyzara's patron asked her to help deal with it, so she's now adventuring once more (though she mostly just wants to get things over with so she can go back home)."4/3/2018 22:06:59,Flashing Steel,Tabaxi,Fighter,"Presenting the one, the only, Flashing Steel (Steel to my friends), star of stages and scourge of evildoers across Toril.

"4/6/2018 5:35:26,Quill/Koten/Quote Spellsong /Panati/Silverfond,Half-Elf,Bard,"Legends tell us of a bard unrivaled, who sang colors to the blind and danced sound to the deaf. Who could spread a lie quicker than the flames of Neverwinter’s volcanoes, and unveil the truth truer than any scholar known to man. Who could break a heart with the trailing of music off and away, or mend it with poems of bittersweet elegance and romantic rhymes reviving. Who could tell stories that would make a strong man cry, and cure sorrow with a celestial smile of white.This was a bard with knowledge of the stars and the skies. The trees and the plants. The poor and the rich. The locked and the free. A bard who knew the secrets of metals and stones, of oceans and seas. Who could unleash the might of thunder and channel the powers of fire. Who could summon the wind by name and conjure up celestial lights. An arcane musician whose notes echoes a cross the ethereal.Quill Spellsong was his name, and it is a name highly known around the forgotten realms. Famous and infamous. He had patrons among the wealthy, and hosts among kings. He had lovers and admirers, fans, and friends. His knowledge unbounding, there wasn’t a university that hadn’t hosted his habits. But he also had enemies among nobles he satirized, and kings he threatened. He had infuriated professors, angered scholars, and insulted musicians with his quick wit and silver tongue. For these people, Quill was a bard of renown, and the only person known to ever successfully perform the entirety of more than a few difficult songs. He was the man they feared and the man they craved. However, Quill had a history unwritten in his lore. A history of death, bloodshed, and sorrow. A broken heart and an injured pride. But that aside…Koten Panati was raised a farmer.  She helped around here and there, while always studying her music on the side. She had a simple and innocent life. At the age of 12, she discovered something that would change that life. The fact that this wasn’t her first.While the Panati was visiting the shores and caves nearby to their farm, celebrating the farm’s success that year and the money they had acquired, Koten, always the curious girl, delved deep and deeper into the shoreline caverns. Her parents and siblings lost in the moment, did not notice her slip off into the damp darkness.Within the caves, Panati bravely trekked further into the looming darkness, playing her lute all the while. She played mindlessly as she wandered, until she tripped over something sticking out of the ground. It was a lute case buried in the moist dirt. For a long time it had been forgotten, lost, and neglected.Unzipping the case, Panati found herself holding a shabby lute… but one that had been cared for into a state of magnificence. Just gazing upon it, she could feel the heart and soul that had been imparted into the lute. Perhaps, because it called her. It resonated within her. Feeling the lute, she knew it had been carefully cared for, delicately treated like a fragile flower. When her hands glazed along the  strings – the only fancy piece of the simple instrument was one singular mithral string in the middle of the seven total – she could hear the songs it once played without every plucking a note.Setting her lute aside, she held the mithral-stringed lute in her hands, her spirit growing in confidence. Something inside of her struggled to get free. An irresistible desire to connect with the instrument. And so she did. She played until she drifted out of focus and of consciousness into a dissonant sleep. Memories flashed through her mind. Memories of a past life. Of past love. The lute in her hands. The music it played. Her DEATH.Koten opened her eyes and plucked the final notes of the ethereal tune, a song she had never known before – in this life at least. Koten opened her eyes, different than she once was. For now she remembered who she was and would be again. Quill Spellsong.Something within the deeper tunnels trembled and tremored. An ethereal light from deeper still came to vision and slowly crept its way closer. There were shadows of horrid elder creatures emerging from shadows below. Koten, on instinct, fled the caverns as soon as the void beasts piled out of the darkness like terrifying scarabs and roaches.Chasing her out of the tunnels, an ethereal and dissonant song followed her wherever she went. The music rattling in her head like a taunting attack. It was not the music of Quill Spellsong or herself or any other bard she knew. It was the song she had played instinctively on the mithral-string lute. The lute still in her hands.As she gazed upon its abandoned condition, and the singular shiny string of mithral, she noticed arcana sparking off the strings like lightning. The strings acting as conducts to the electricity of the musician’s touch.  Distracted, she tripped over a stone. Ahead, the light of the setting sun. So close, but yet so far. The voidlings drew closer. Swarmed towards her. She wanted to cower in a corner and hide like the little girl she was. Hide behind her valiant father, in her mother’s caring arms. She wanted to be anywhere but here.Luckily for Koten, she wasn’t alone in her mind. The instincts of her past life pushing through, her fingers began to strike chords. The pace of the music increasing in parallel to her rushing heartbeat. The voidlings drew closer, the music more intense. One of the disfigured elder beasts lunged forward, and she struck the final note, her fingers now laced in the arcing arcana energy.A wave of thunder washed from the lute extending into the dark caverns below. The voidlings were blown back and stunned. Some were even killed by the electric discharge of the blast. Bravery kicking in, she thrust to her feet and dashed out of the caves as they collapsed behind her from the thunderous wave.Emerging to the shoreline, she found it burning. Her parents’ corpses strewn about and viciously torn. Partially eaten by some ferocious beast. Scattering away from the bloody scene, were void beasts slipping into shadows and crevices in the rocky wall behind and around her.In shock, Koten stayed there for hours. Playing sorrow goodbyes on her new lute, her old one lost forever in the shadows. Returning to her family’s farm, hoping to grab things of value before hitting the road, she stumbled upon a group of mercenaries smashing apart the building, seeking for someone and something. She need not know any more. She heard the words pass their lips.“What are we still doing here? Do you really think we’re going to stumble upon Quill Spellsong on a peasant’s farm?”“Don’t forget the girl. What was her name? Cotton?”“Koten. The little Panati girl.”“We find her, we find Quill, and we find what we’ve been paid to find. They’ll probably come back shortly. It’s getting late. We’ll be here when they do.”Koten ran away, her mind melding with that of Quills. Logic persisting, knowledge returning, and wisdom flowing. Koten knew what she needed to do. What songs she needed to play. What notes would ring truths and lies and guide her where she need go. What masks she would need to wear.Koten joined the first caravan she came across, playing music for the merchants and travelers every night in exchange for a ride. She adopted the name Quote Silverfond, and with it, she spent three years chasing down secrets of her past life, her new life, and the ethereal song of the void. In her first town, Quote was stricken poor. She had no money. No food or water. She played as an entertainer at a local inn for many tenday. But there came a time when people began to ask too many questions, and throw too many curious eyes her way. Quote embarked on a trip to Phandelin, hoping to have better luck in that small but growing town. Upon arriving, she was quickly dissuaded from her choice of stay. Her face tenday there, someone was murdered. Shortly following that, these gigantic beasts of the ocean fell from the sky and crushed the mayor’s manor house. Many crazy things happened in Phandelin, and she decided it best to move on to Luskan. Besides, there was too much competition there already between a lute bard like herself and a short gnome with chocolates and a recorder. The gnome was surprisingly good, and only unleashing her true potential as Quill could she best him. Now was not the time to reveal her identity.In Luskan, the rebuilding port city, Quote managed to live a poor musician’s life. The history of Luskan rich in the arcane, she attempted to seek knowledge in the few libraries remaining from before that Lich blew up half the town. Rebuilding her skills, Quote could enthrall an audience and put them to sleep with arcane lullabies. Sharpening her tongue, Quote’s wit could diffuse intense bar fights, lift moods, and allure money from nobles and patrons.By the time she turned 14, the mercenaries finally caught up to her. Confronting her in an alley, they pulled knives on her. They wanted to know where Quill Spellsong was. They didn’t know that she was Quill Spellsong. Good, she thought; they’ll underestimate my capabilities.Grabbing her lute, Quote let the spirit and mind of Quill Spellsong take control. Striking her chords, and channeling her arcana, Quote unleashed chords of thunder at her enemies. The streets of Luskan shook under her power. Disarming a thug, Quote took his dagger and stabbed at one of the others. Soon, all the mercenaries lay dead before her.Bleeding out of her leg, for she had been cut during the fight, Quote looted the corpses for daggers and gold. Knowing there would be more, she patched herself up roughly; she’d have a limp for a few days, but the scar would heal. Quote purchased armor, for if someone was truly trying to kill her, she’d need it. Wearing her leather and cloak, lute strapped around her back, Quote set forth back to Neverwinter, the city that loomed over her family’s farm. There she would seek real answers. In the colleges of Neverwinter, the streets, and the inns, Quote would begin her journey.(At this point, Quote has remembered the talents she once had, and must reconnect with. She remembers vaguely the songs and plays she had performed to wondrous appeal. Slowly these memories return as she performs. Quote knows that she was Quill and Koten before. She remembers dying in a burst of ethereal light. She remembers that the basics of the knowledge she once held as Quill. Perhaps most importantly, she remembers the lute in her hands and holds brief flashes of pleasing memories, the story of the Mithral String. The lute was all Quill could afford, and its nostalgia remained with him even when he could have purchased another instrument far more beautiful. Instead he spent his money on a set of silver strings for the lute of his lover, Destiny Fatespeaker. All Quote remembers of her is the love she felt towards Destiny. She cannot remember her face, touch, or smell. The sound of her voice or instrument. Only the purest feelings of the heart. And the fact that of the seven strings of mithral Quill “wasted” her lifes savings on and thus gifted to her lover, Destiny had only taken six. One of the seven strings was the middle string laced between Quotes lute. The ethereal song that Koten had played in the caverns continues to taunt her. Its dissonant terror a mocking call of the void.)"4/6/2018 14:19:47,Epiphany Placeholder,Tiefling,Cleric,"Epiphany was left on an orphanage doorstep as a child.

An aimless, idle tinker's apprentice, she spent her days drinking, philandering, cheating at dice, and maybe on occasion doing a little bit of work, although few would believe it. 'Til one day, Wynn, along with the girl she was seeing at the time, inadvertently stumbled into a cave where a petrified but still living archfey was imprisoned and driven to near madness in its isolation. With dumb luck on her side, she recognized the language it screamed in, Sylvan, which she had learned a smattering of, if only to recite poetry and pick up chicks at the bar. Her grammar wasn't perfect, but the accent was pretty spot on, and she managed to talk the fey being down. She escaped with her life but her life alone, and only in exchange for her service. Her senses were enchanted, allowing her to become the archfey's eyes and legs in the world, and she was compelled, rather against her will, to travel and seek out new experiences so the creature could partake in the world beyond its prison, and perhaps discover means of freeing it. She has only been on the road a little while, but she's already seen quite a bit as the archfey doesn't allow her to sit still for too long."4/8/2018 1:12:34,Gnat,Half-Orc,Eldritch Knight,"Abandoned by her elven mother as a child, the young half-orc was perhaps fortunate to be discovered and taken in by a roaming pack of orcs.

Gnat worked hard to ensure she could keep up with her peers and deserve her place among the warriors, but she always had interests that lay beyond those of the pack. During raids, she would often find books and spend hours delving into them. Then one day, while ransacking a wizard's home, she found herself blown away by the contents of the books she found there. Literally. In awe of the power contained in those words, she took it as a sign to finally part ways with a tribe that had only ever tolerated her, and “convinced” the wizard to take her on as a student. She stayed with him over a year, but eventually grew bored with his lethargic way of life and frustrated by her own lack of progress with magic.

The other hunters were off checking in their own directions. They couldn't read their prey like I could. But it helped that I knew Bugdal. He was 19 years old, surely having the physique of a man at this point but without the experience to consider important details of his actions like the gorge half a mile in front of him.	Then I hear a loud splash about 20 yards in front of me. My prey is near. Running across branches I catch up close enough to see his maniked form clutching his wounded side and clawing to get as much ground as he could. I jump down toward him and spring off his his soldiers, enforcing a strong face plant. When fighting an orc, it’s always important to go for a hard knock to the head first. An orc with a concussion is far more pleasant than an angry orc. Knowing your prey is the difference between victory and defeat.	Bugdal drags himself up and swivels his head around to look at his attacker. A certain spark lights in his eyes and in an instant I was no longer looking at a wounded soldier but instead at a full-size tiger. He’s a Druid! With the high density of our wood elf captors in the region nature never chooses an orc as its champion. Suddenly his actions seem significantly more brave as the tree-huggers would have slashed his throat simply for having innate magic capabilities. Selective breeding I suppose.	I grip my machete in my right arm as my left slowly reached for the wooden pike strapped to my back. All at once the large cat sprang forward with its wide set of teeth and claws on full display. I quickly respond by ripping the spear loose from its harness and directing it toward the oncoming predator. The spear’s end connects with the beast’s sternum. Using all my strength I swing it over me and pin it to the ground. The hunt was over.	The tiger howled in pain as it made vain attempts to escape my weapon’s grasp. While it struggled their I began to admire the beast. The proud orange fur that announced it’s presence with vigor, the powerful claws used to chase its prey and easily finish it, and its absolute yellow eyes that would never blink in the face of its enemies. Eventually Bugdal stopped struggling and I stepped forward and placed my blade against his neck. Without moving his head he simply looked up at me with his fluorescent eyes. Not with anger. Not with hate. Not with feat. But with sorrow. The sorrow of a boy whom was not allowed to live. I closed my eyes and quickly pulled the knife.	I looked down at myself. The cut must have spurted because my leather armor was soaked in blood. Orc blood. This was perverse. How could I allow myself to slaughter my brethren while my worst enemies loomed above me laughing? In that moment something lit in me that I had never known before.	I returned to the encampment with the polymorphed form slung over my shoulder a few hours later. Waiting for me on the edge of the camp was the elven ranger commander Rinlor and at least a dozen of the encampment soldiers waiting with bows. Here the four other orc rangers were waiting for me to return while, as the rules dictate, holding heavy crates above their heads until their last member returned. I stop about 20 yards in front of the group.	Rinlor sneered. “Decided to skip the mission to go big game hunting, have we? Ona ta a'amin”. I don’t speak Elvish but I’ve seen enough orcs make mistakes before to know what it meant.	At once another leaf licker stepped out from the tent leading an orc woman by her leash and shackles. The woman that taught me everything I know today. One of the only orcs capable of showing more technique and skill than any elf on camp. The only leverage that the elves have over me. My mother.	The elf knocked her to the ground in front of Rinlor. I said “He was a druid. He took this form then I killed him.”“What, you think I haven’t heard that story before? Come on, Morbash, at least try something new.” His eyes examined my mother in detail “Now, if memory serves the punishment for returning late is enduring two days in the chamber and with the lie you just told that’ll be a total of five days. But I’m in a good mood so I’ll go easy on you this time. Instead of staying in that hell hole I’ll let her reside in comfort of my own personal quarters.” The carcass fell at my side and my gaze was unbreakably fixed onto Rinlor. I gripped my knife. 	“Oh struck a nerve have I?” He forces her to her feet with one hand and draws a knife that he keeps cleaner than even his silverware and held it up to her neck. My mother was getting older and was heavily bound so she didn’t even make an attempt to resist his actions. Shame was painted on her face. Shame that she was powerless now. Shame that her very life was such a burden on her son. Shame that this is the legacy as the greatest Orc ranger to date, her legacy, is living out her days either being tortured or waiting to be tortured.“Maybe next time you’ll actually catch the damned grey skinned bastar-”. SKKNT! All thirteen wood elves now stare in awe at the knife protruding from the woman’s chest. It was not the dainty blade that Rinlor held that ended my mother’s life. It was her own dagger that did it, a dagger that was passed down to me.	“Look! Over here, momma! I found a big furry snake stuck in a bear trap!” I called to my mother. She casually strode over and frowned when she saw what I was pointing at.	“Damned daisy biters. Using cruel traps in place of real skill.” She got down low so as to look at her six year old son in the eye. “That’s not a snake, that’s a fox’s leg. When smart foxes get their leg stuck in a bear trap, they bite their leg off. Remember traps like these should be used on large animals only.” 	I laugh from my belly. “Why don’t the foxes want their legs anymore, Momma?”	She had already walked over to the trap and started deconstructing it. “You see if the fox had decided to keep its leg then after suffering for a few days the hunter would return and kill the fox, meaning that the fox would not only lose its leg, but the rest of it’s body too. Only the weak foxes wait for the hunter to return.”	“Oh,” I stared at the pieces of the trap on the ground.	“Here take this,” I looked up to my mother who was holding out one of the fox’s claws. “So you  never forget to be the smart fox.”Now a 6 months have past since the incident back at the encampment. I’ve been living out of the jungle. I now wear the tiger’s tooth around my neck along with my fox’s claw. The elves want me for 1000 gold for the murder of thirteen elves and the destruction of property, namely my mother. I’ve put down two bounty hunters so far and I expect more. To the orcs I’ve become a symbol of revolution. They call me The Tiger. The elves continue to propagate my story as that of a lunatic to prevent further revolt, but the orcs know what really happened. My story's even began spreading to other encampments and mining colonies. Orc revolts have reached an all-time high and a few other select individuals have escaped and began looking for me to join my efforts against the elvish reign of terror. Eventually I will seek them out to free our people once and for all but for now I must gather intel and prepare myself to call for revolution."4/12/2018 16:47:17,Tentoria Chikara,Human,Warlock,"Tentoria grew up on a family farm in the small northwestern village of Frick. The village had little to offer in the way of variety. At age 13, inspired by the local alchemist's tales of travel, Tentoria decided it was time to set out.On her travels she got to see many things of many natures. She heard the greats speak of their knowledge. She read books written by the highest scholars. She learned the history of the lands she lived in, and treasured every piece of information she gained.By age 16, she attracted the attention of The Elder Eye. She was offered greater knowledge beyond her reach. In exchange, she would bring destruction to parts of the world. She reluctantly accepted.With her newfound knowledge and abilities, Tentoria doubled down on her wont for travel. She began descending into caves containing nasty creatures. She broke into abandoned places in search of forgotten knowledge.

She left the circus and became a thief, and a drunkard before finally meeting her adventuring party."4/20/2018 19:31:24,Drazi Linec,Human,Oracle,"I don't remember much from before, just flashes here and there. Laughter. Sunrises. The smell of rain in the air. Smiling faces. I had a happy childhood.That all changed one day. I recall hearing shouting and screaming. I remember blood. All I know for sure is that I was found under an overturned wagon, half starved, the only survivor of a group of eighteen. My ""uncle"" took care of me from then on. We're Varisian, and of the same clan, so we're probably related somehow. But he wasn't like other Varisians. He wasn't exactly Scarzni, but he wasn't far from them, either. I remember him clearly that day, looking at me straight in the eyes, but somehow through me as well, not behind me, but somewhere else my eyes led.He took me with him to Magnimar. I stayed with him under the Irespan, that colossal remnant of a bridge that stretches out into the sea. On a clear afternoon, you could get maybe an hour of sunlight as the sun slipped from the bridge above into the ocean. For five years I lived there. I learned how to stay sharp, always on my toes. My eyesight even improved to the point that I could see as well under the bridge as I could on the rare occassions I was allowed to leave its cover.Uncle Vikram hosted an odd assortment of travelers now and again. Many wore hoods and other clothing of concealment, to hide their bestial, reptilian features. Others wouldn't care, clacking clawed fingers on a table while staring at me, waiting for me to react. Often they would talk in a strange language that I slowly began to learn in secret. But mostly they would gather in a room upstairs. I wasn't allowed in, but I could hear their chanting voices sometimes. And every once in a while, the crackle of fire.One day, when I was thirteen, everything ended. I was eating with Uncle Vikram and a couple of his friends, when he announced today was a special day, and he handed me a cup of wine. His friends nodded and smiled. I took a drink, and it didn't taste like wine (I had secretly gotten ahold of some the year prior and woke up on the seashore, half freezing from the cold water, missing my money and my shoes), but I finished the small cup. And then started to feel sleepy. As I collapsed to the floor, I heard Vikram say, ""He's only a copper, but that's good enough for us."" Then blackness took me.I woke up in pain. I was tied facedown to a table, my arms and legs tied separately, forming my body into an X. I was stripped to the waist, and the pain was coming from my back in sharp strokes. ""Flip him over,"" someone said, and my bounds were loosened. I tried to fight them, but they eaily overpowered me and tied me back down on my back. My uncle came forward with a bloody knife and began carving into my chest, and I realized he must have done to same to my back. I screamed until my uncle stopped for a moment to make a strange gesture, and my screams disappeared in an instant. I could feel myself screaming, but no sound could come out.After a minute or two (I could not tell) he stopped and stepped back. A ring formed around me of thirteen people, all in various states of transformation. Even my uncle has started to grow scales on his neck and arms. They chanted in unison, and flames appeared in a circle around us. Then something went wrong. I couldn't tell what, but the men's voices became panicked. My uncle came forward with the knife held high above his head, ready to plunge it into my chest.Then everything went crazy. There was an explosion, I was later told, wrecking an entire block of the Underbridge. I remember being pushed by a great force, then falling, then everything went black.Father Abstalar Zantus pulled me from the rubble. I was bloody, bruised, and my arm and leg were broken. I kept passing out from the pain, but he took me to a healer somewhere in the Summit (the rich part of Magnimar) and had my bones mended and my injuries healed. But they couldn't fix everything. They found they could do nothing to erase the jagged scars my late uncle gave me. But there were other problems of a non-physical nature manifesting. I was hearing things. Voices. Some curious. Some scared. Some angry. Spirits of people who had died in the explosion. They frightened and fascinated me. But what was even more strange was my hair. I hadn't had a good look at myself in ages, and my hair had changed from the dark brown it used to be into a striking mix of copper brown. Was this what my uncle meant by ""a copper""? I do not know.The priest and I took slow walks around the Capital District while I recuperated, showing me the important buildings around me. He was also very interested in my birthmark, which by then was nearly fully formed. He told me about how it's the symbol of Desna, the goddess he worshipped. He was even the first person to tell me about Oracles. I think he suspected what I was. What I was becoming.After a week, he brought me to my new family. By luck, a group of Varisians were passing through the city, and one of the elders was my actual uncle, Ogdred. I saw my father in his face, and his brother in mine. It felt wrong to call him my uncle, though. That word had become sinister to me. But he, my aunt and my cousins all understood. I thanked the professor profusely, hugging him. It was the last time I ever saw him.When we left the city, I finally felt like I was home again. But it was different somehow. My cousins seemed to have deeper wells of joy. Even when the musicians played the rowdiest tune and the dancers moved in the most energetic way, it never realy stirred something in me. I could remember delighting in that kind of thing when I was little, but now, not so much. I wasn't unhappy, far from it. I just wasn't moved.My birthmark was a thing to be celebrated. They taught me how to use an actual starknife. Though I never really did well at the dancing, I was pretty good with the ways of the bladed scarf and the starknife itself. They would prod me to perform in their traveling show, tossing the starknife into simple targets, showing off my birthmark. Slowly, I grew in confidence.Things went on like that for the next couple of years. I grew into my body and my powers. I discovered that my aunt, a fortune-teller, could speak the strange language of my ""uncle"". She told me it was the language of dragons, and I learned more of it from her. It was in my sixteenth summer that I began to get tattooed. I decided to leave the jagged scars from Vikram's knife alone, and instead asked for a vine to wrap my body, with seventeen closed buds to represent the family I lost. I added a blue swallowtail butterfly for Desna, and a seven-pointed star for strength and magic, for I was growing in both. Though the angrier spirits still pushed my things around when I wasn't looking, or made strange noises in the dark, I found I could harness a few of the others and get them to move small things around or make specific noises on command.Our group shed some families and picked up others. The newer people seemed less okay with me and my spirits than the others who had been there when I first joined them. I started to wonder if I should break off on my own. When I was seventeen, Ogdred presented me with our family scarf, a symbol of passage into adulthood. It was purple, as both fortune-tellers and oracles ran strong in our family. I cried to see the branch where only I remained, and I thanked him profusely. Soon after, I felt it was time to strike out on my own, at least for a while. We were near Sandpoint, where Father Zantus now lived. I said my goodbyes to my cousins and the other families in our group, and I headed off to visit him, and for their Swallowtail Release."4/20/2018 23:09:37,"Lenora ""Lylah"" Dellius",Halfling,rogue,Abducted by cultist monks before having her mind wiped at age 10 and living on the street as an urchin child4/21/2018 16:25:06,Ennis,Half-Elf,Druid,"Ennis was once the youngest and most talented hunter in her village. One day, she decided to test her skills against the local giant eagle, Stanley. When she woke up several hours later, bleeding and with many broken bones in the forest, she had no idea where she was. During the several weeks she lay there healing, she got to know the animals who lived in the forest, especially the baby bear who came by to lick her wounds. She also had many strange dreams about a goat faced god watching her. Eventually, she came to care for the animals she used to hunt and renounced her old ways to live in the forest. For several years, she and the bear (who she named Huggins) lived and hunted together, roaming through the woods living in harmony with nature. However, half elves live much longer than bears. The night after Huggins died, Ennis had another dream about the goat faced god. When she woke up, she found herself many miles away, among the followers of the goat faced god, who they called Pickles. Pickles was a god of nature, and when he deemed his followers were trained enough in the druidic arts, he sent them to the part of the forest that was in most need of healing. After several years with the Followers of Pickles, Ennis woke up in a strange part of the forest. Few animals lived there due to overhunting, and she used her skills to protect the animals that remained, by hiding them and scaring off poachers with her magic. Eventually, the legend in the local village grew that there was a witch who punished anyone who hurt her forest, and the overhunting stopped. Ennis still doesn't know exactly where she is, or if her work is done yet, so she stays close to the village to keep an eye on hunting parties and every once in a while, she sneaks into the village for a cheese platter.

This was the beginning of the end.Growing up, she was different from her clutch-siblings. She couldn't swim, her body was a different shape, and her scales a different color. They mostly stopped talking to her by the time she was ten.Because of the kith's structure, she didn't have any specific parents. Adult members disclaimed responsibility for her. She was held accountable as an adult at fourteen.At sixteen, she was sweet on a boy who didn't care for the rigid social reactions the rest of the kith had. Where others had shunned her, Rhoxl had smiled at her poor social skills, and began to bring her fish when he realized she couldn't swim.At seventeen, they became mates. The kith reacted poorly, but she didn't care. He didn't care. It was as if only the two of them existed. He made her smile, and her ferocity kept the worst of their critics at bay. At eighteen, she found a patch of dry land in the Mushfens. It became her private space, a home away from home. Herbs that grew there were nowhere else to be found, and she began to tinker and experiment, making poultices and unguents. When Rhoxl came home injured from a hunting party, a gash on his side from a crocodiles jaws, she tended to him. The wound healed and grew over with brilliant golden scales.At nineteen, she laid an egg. It was placed, as is tradition, in the clutch-cave with the others. She was so happy. Finally, acceptance. She returned to her private place, her hidden Grove, only to find it ransacked. The herbs were pulled up, the soil waterlogged. Her dry Earth in this wretched swamp was destroyed, one of only three things she had.At twenty, her egg had still not hatched. It was time for the next batch of eggs to enter the clutch-cave. She took it for herself, and nurtured it in her dwelling with Rhoxl. His lightheartedness ceased to bring her cheer. His silliness could not hatch her unhatchable egg. Several of her clutch-siblings, now adults, came to her door and asked for the egg, that it might be fed back to nature, as is tradition for those seeds which do not sprout. Her refusal sparked a huge argument which would be the end of her life as she knew it.Kresz could not hear her own thoughts above the shouts of her former family. She rocked back and forth silently, the egg in her lap. The cold winter wind blew through the room, raising hackles and tensions. Kith members were surrounding her now, grabbing for one of only two things she had. She snapped. In an instant, K'shar, her clutch-sibling and the kith's strongest hunter, was ablaze. Her right arm, wreathed in flame, was coated in a slick iridescent substance whose pattern burned itself into her scales. As she ran from her burning home, she took one last pleading look back, and locked eyes with Rhoxl, her love, her only joy in this wretched, waterlogged realm. He simply shook his head, his eyes full of sorrow. She lost the last thing she had.At twenty, she was wandering the Cinderlands. She had traveled far to see the land that they say she came from, but it was as unfamiliar as the yondabakari to her. Her pack was stuffed full of everything she could carry from place to place, and small fetishes of bone and sinew hung from its sides, clacking together as she walked. Kneeling down in the sand and grit, she took out her only true possession - her egg. It still had not hatched. A hairline crack ran from the top of the egg halfway down the side, sustained when her dwelling in the kith had burned. As she stared at the egg, it began to wobble in her hands. Startled, she dropped it into the sand, where it landed with a soft pff. It wiggled under the hot summer sun just long enough for her to put it together. Heat! It was the warmth of the fire, of the sun, that had allowed it to begin hatching. Hesitantly, she reached out her right arm to touch the egg. She had become more skilled since her exile, and wreathed her hand in low, flickering flames. Warming the egg, she watched as it split open to reveal a small, scaly form. Her eyes widened. This was the beginning."5/3/2018 9:22:09,Felicius Cornelius,Human,Cleric,"He was born into a well off family in the countryside who called him Felix.

He was an only child, and for the first few years of his life he was kept to a rigid schedule of education and magical training. This included reading on the subject of the family history, which has quite a bit on demons–it is said within the family that their fates were once entwined with that of a fiend, and may be again, so they all are to learn and prepare for that eventuality, though until recently he thought that was rubbish and never payed it much mind. After a particularly harsh year (when Benny was about eight), things changed. All of his parents’ coin and more was going to keeping up the appearance that they were still rich, so they couldn’t afford to continue his education, and they were always too busy to pay any attention to him. Except to reprimand him for taking too much food, or dirtying his clothes, or growing out of his old shoes, don’t you know these things cost money, Bentley!Benny took to spending most of his time away from home, with other youngsters of his age, particularly those richer than him. Whenever possible, he subtly ensured that he was never the one paying for anything, and would even lie and steal from them–not that they missed a few dozen gold here and there. He used the coin to stockpile his own meals  (which he kept hidden from his parents lest they confiscate it or his hidden cash) and fund a wardrobe so his parents wouldn’t scold him for needing them to pay for it. He and his friends all took to playing cards together often, for real stakes, and he won often. He never told them about his family’s troubles, and he was good at cards–but the other children were trained for politics too, so he was never quite sure if they knew. The two he was with most often when not at home, elf twins Mason and Cecilia, Benny knew were better than him, and yet never quite seemed to come out victorious when Benny had a chance left. He wasn’t sure he minded.As he got to be around eighteen, Benny’s parents started noticing him a little more. More specifically, they started noticing his marriage prospects. Ought a charming, handsome young lad like their Bentley not be able to find a good–by which they meant wealthy–wife? Against his wishes, they began arranging a wedding with a girl of around his age, Jane. Benny hated this idea. For one thing, he and Jane were acquainted, and not in a good way. But more importantly, it was the principle of the thing; why should he want to help his family out of their troubles, when they never cared about him? And of course, Benny already had a boyfriend, though he hadn't told his parents--Mason. This clarified for Benny what he had felt for a while: he had to leave. So he did. It wasn’t even hard–he often went days or weeks without really seeing his parents, they likely wouldn’t notice for some time if he just walked out. His friends would, though, so before he left he met with Mason and Cecilia one last time. They talked for a while, then embraced (Benny would later find one or the other of them had slipped a small pouch of gold and gems into his pocket, and a wooden ring that Mason, amateur woodcarver, had clearly hand-made with his initials, B.F., carved into it, and the twins would each find a playing card in theirs, as Benny had little else to give). After that point, he left his old life behind and started going by new names. Wolfgang was not his first, just his latest.Wolfgang traveled the continent hiding his magic and acting as a con artist, mostly for the thrill of it once he had enough funds to get by, though his card-playing made it tough to keep a lot stocked up at any one time–his win rate was noticeably lower than when he played with his friends when he was younger. He took on jobs with no training to see if he could do them by cramming (with mixed success), but mostly kept to small cons so he wouldn’t draw too much attention. He keeps detailed notes on almost everything, written in Abyssal and transliterated into Elvish script, then encrypted with a keyed rotational cipher. The Empire arrived when he was 20, but he kept out of the fighting and it didn’t change his life particularly–lies are lies no matter who’s in charge. He wonders sometimes if his friends, and on particular days his parents, survived the war, but he hasn’t sought them out.Recently, as he was posing as the invented persona Anrar Nidisc, refurbishment auditor at a library (which has since burnt down, not that Wolfgang knows that yet) and enjoying free access to ancient texts while waiting to see if they’d realize that refurbishment auditor isn’t a real position, he came across an old scroll written in Abyssal. It is mostly unreadable, but he was able to make out a few words clearly, including the name “Fensler”. After the initial shock of finding the name he hadn’t associated with in nearly four years, in a demonic script, essentially confirming the family stories he’d thought were nonsense, he asked about any texts related to this one. He was told that there were none there, but he might be able to find one in Northgate. After tying up the identity of Anrar so he could return as him later if necessary, he took the scroll (without asking) and set out."5/3/2018 10:41:44,Dordmuin Woodwasp,gnome,warrior,"Bored with my family clan's chosen profession of woodcutters, I left my father in the middle of felling a tree to wander.

When he managed to do so, he apprenticed himself to a wizard, the Dark Lord of Fremnia, Lord Reydthe. Lord Reydthe taught his apprentice everything he knew about Magic, Dark Magic, and Darkness in general, and once Steer was confident he knew it all, he began trying to assassinate his Master to take his place. I say he began trying, because it took thirty-seven attempts over the span of three months. While planning out the 38th, Steer neglected his health, fell ill, and accidentally contaminated his Master, who died in two days while Sebastian clung to life by a thread. Claiming he had successfully murdered Reydthe, Steer then took over Fremnia, which he proclaimed the capital of his Empire. Despite his lack of subtlelty and general bumblings, Emperor Steer turned out to be an incredibly powerful sorcerer, and his raw magical power was enough to drive an army of Wights forward to expand his empire. Within ten years, the entire Known World was now part of the ""Evil Empire"". Fortunately, after ten years of tyranny, the world breathed a sigh of discombobulated relief when Steer's bed was found empty one morning. The mad emperor was gone. Poof. Just like that. It is assumed the massive amounts of magical power coursing through his body caused some reaction in Steer's sleep that obliterated him to the last atom, or, perhaps, that he merely fell into a random plothole from which he never emerged.

After making examples of the few villagers who took up arms, the gnolls made their demands: the village would give them whatever valuables and food they had and, if it was sufficient, the gnolls would not supplement their rations with the tender meat of the village's children.  The village complied, and the gnolls left.They came back a month later, with the same demand.  This went on for more than a year, and though they never supplemented the tribute, it was a year of fear and hunger in the village. It only ended when a band of adventurers arrived and destroyed the gnolls.  Of course, they didn't return one coin of the villager's stolen property, but young Darius saw how grateful his parents were.  That's when he knew this was his destiny, to wander the lands saving people and growing rich thereby.As soon as he found one of the gnoll's weapons that had been too common and cheap for the adventurers to cart off as booty, he began training in the sword.

However, the religion itself was never really his calling. He appreciated and learned about it, but (as half-elves are wont to do) only loosely associated with it. Still, he was surrounded by people with strong opinions of moral right and wrong, so despite his general ambivalence towards faith, he did end up with a perhaps idealized concept of and desire to do good.His adoptive father, Serge, was a former monk and adventurer from outside the city, so from a young age he taught Avi to fight and defend himself. It was, of course, more theoretical than actually going out and fighting things. Serge does feel rather fatherly towards Avi, but he’s also got a sort of tough-love approach: seeing that though Avi spent his free time reading and studying he wasn’t likely to become a religious professional, he essentially kicked Avi out of the temple and told him to go figure out what he is going to do with his life. Avi very much admires and respects Serge, but is also kind of terrified of him, since he has a gruff personality, so he dutifully went out into the city.He quickly decided that the best way he could help people and still earn some money for food (since he’s  doing his best to stay away from the temple in the hours Serge is awake, which is also the times when they serve food) is to work as a mercenary of sorts. He’s… not been doing too well at that, since he’s a very nervous kid, and not comfortable with charging people. One of his early customers was Ela Sade, an old woman from an Eshuetin district, who’s own son is a Kruzidier agitator too busy with politics to really care for her. Her son sends her money to make sure she can eat and not lose her home, but she doesn’t have any other income, and is only really connected to some of her neighbors who either don’t know that her son is infamous for causing trouble or don’t care. Avi, therefore, worries about her, and tries to help her out as much as possible. She thinks he’s a very nice young man…. Especially since her mode of paying him is usually to give him fresh bread or some of whatever food she’s cooking, and despite that he was raised with the privilege of an acolyte, he never complains.Not everyone who Avi runs into outside of the temple likes him so much, however. Shay, for example, is unimpressed by his regular appearance in the Eshuetin district. He’s a street kid, who sees Avi as an outsider who must have grown up pampered, with life in the temple. He gives Avi trouble whenever he sees him, harassing him verbally, stealing his bread—and Avi doesn’t know what to do about it when he just wants to find work and get paid. He could reasonably try to turn Shay over to the guard, but most of the people who live in the district like him, so Avi thinks there must be some good him.And Shay’s assessment is not entirely wrong. Avi’s life in the temple was comfortable. He had one good friend: Aubrey, a Halfling now training as a healer in the temple. She was, in truth, more like an older sister or cousin, a bit overbearing and practical wherever Avi is idealistic, but fiercely loyal and protective. Elana Skylark, the head of the temple Avi lives at, was even mildly fond of Avi, and if Avi wasn’t so nervous he couldn’t have a proper conversation with her she would help him find a place in the city using her connections beyond the temple. Of course, not all of it was good, either; most of the acolytes disliked him, and some outright bullied him. Booker Redhat, one of the temple scholars, a Gnome and the cook, disliked Avi as a rule of thumb, since when he was being taught as young child he would always ask questions rather than just accept what Booker said as fact.On the whole, he lived where he never wanted for anything; he had food, a place to sleep, and plenty of books. Now, he is trying to figure out how to make this mercenary thing works—which is why he takes the first job."5/3/2018 12:39:58,Sanctity,Tiefling,Paladin,An orphan who was starving and wandering through the woods when a divine light showed her the way to a church.

Likely due to their gender, compounded by the large curling horns that marked them as devilborn.Found by a street gang, Ori was reared by a harsh taskmaster and leader of said gang, Alcoss, who demanded loyalty and used Ori's and Anu's size and natural dexterity to the advantage of his theives' gang. For any involved with his organization, disobedience was met with Swift and deliberate punishment, and for many, the only way out was death.For Ori and his brother, respite came in their companionship and a pet mouse rescued from strays, named Nix. Along with forays into the city Library, and long talks with a sympathetic librarian, Molly.Unfortunately,, if discovered, both boys faced whippings.Ori, however, had the added complications of whispered voices only half heard, shadowy figures at the edge of vision, and flares of power that he didn't understand. Although his brother tried to help and comfort Ori, the problem only grew worse the longer they tried to hide it.The tipping point came on the day of the brothers' 16th birthday, when Anu made an attempt to steal a few sweetcakes for celebration, but instead was discovered and tossed into prison. Refused rescue by their gang leader, Ori freed his brother himself, and returned to the hideout to lay low.Furious by their disobedience, and terrified to be discovered by law enforcement, Alcoss proceeded to chain both up, and beat then half to death.In a last desperate move, Ori began speaking to those whispery voices, offering a deal - save him and his brother, and he would do their bidding.As soon as the deal was struck, dark, shadowy tentacles erupted from Ori's body, breaking the shackles, and destroying walls. Fleeing the collapsing building, Ori and Anu ran back into Alcoss. In the ensuing battle, Ori lost control and smashed his brother into the side of a nearby building, bringing it down on top of both Anu and Alcoss.Distraught by the belief that he had killed his brother, Anu fled the destruction as first responders arrived.Pledging to save people in memory of his brother, and doing his best to refuse the maddening influence of his otherworldly benefactors."5/3/2018 13:13:07,Spaghetti Creature Timmy,Shoebox,Cleric,He infinitely creates spaghetti inside of his shoebox body and you can eat it to heal yourself.5/3/2018 13:13:50,Tullio Venturi,Aasimar,Paladin,5/3/2018 13:16:22,Tenzin Dolma,Half-Elf,Mystic,"Born in the mountains of Tabot, tucked away within the continent of Kara-Tur, he was raised at a monastery dedicated to the Path of Dust.

"5/3/2018 13:41:20,Kaw'Stik the Poisoner,Half-Orc,Alchemist,"The Muk orcs hail from the swamps deep within the heart of the Blackwood. It is a terrain that punishes the typical Orcish virtues of belligerent strength and blind rage, instead rewarding those able to avoid or endure hazards both venomous and poisonous. As such, Mukal orcs are less brutish and more cunning than their plains-roaming kin. Kaw'Stik was raised as an apprentice to his mother, the chef of the Blackwood Muk, a taxing but honored position as there is so little edible matter to be found. Instead he found that while he had an aptitude for combining plants and animals, what came out was seldom a food so much as a concoction, earning him his tribal title. When a more suitable apprentice was determined, he left the Blackwood to find his father, a human merchant who (so the stories from his mother had gone) was last seen on the way to Desaya to seek his fortune. He made a traveling wage selling salves, regeants, and toxins to passers-by, and finally found himself in the great city itself."5/3/2018 15:01:27,Karushiri (Rush),Tiefling,Sorcerer,"Our rooms above my mother’s spice shop were the only home I remember growing up. I was Shiri to my mother, but Rush was the name I’d hear as I made my way quickly through the city on errands for the shop. I learned to avoid the local children when I was young, their stares and whispers following me as I passed. On bad days, with bad people, they’d be accompanied by threats and taunts about my heritage - an incentive to find the quieter routes through the city, the less-frequented back alleys and little-known shortcuts.I knew nothing of my father other than that he must have been a tiefling – I certainly didn’t inherit my horns or tail from my human mother. Whenever I asked about him, my mother put me off with an “I’ll tell you when you’re older”, and changed the subject or sent me out on a delivery.I have always been able to do small magical tricks – nothing fancy, slamming doors shut, or causing flames to flicker, another inheritance from my father, I’m guessing – but adolescence brought with it more powerful magic, a wild magic that I struggled to control. Over time I learned to focus this magic, finding practical applications around the house, hiding my distinctive looks for a short while, and placating or defending myself from the bullies when needed. With the help of my mother’s herbal knowledge, we created concoctions that lessened the unpredictable surges of wild magic that were often a side effect of my new powers. Learning the uses of the herbs and spices we sold was a pleasant pastime we sharedI was 17 when everything changed. Walking one of my usual back routes through the city, I spotted light reflecting off a small object, half-hidden under the rubbish in the alley. It was a small egg-shaped stone, pale green and mottled, slightly warm to the touch, and sent a tingling sensation up my arm when I touched it, which was somehow oddly comforting. I put it in my pocket to look at when I got home and continued with my deliveries.As chance had it, I took the same route back home, but when I turned the corner to the alley, I immediately drew back: two rough looking individuals were clearly searching for something. I heard them muttering angrily at each other, each blaming the other. “We can’t go back without it. Erakos will have our hide.” Then one of them looked up and caught me watching. I didn’t wait to find out what would happen, but turned and ran. I knew other routes home, well enough to make sure I wasn’t followed. Or at least, that’s what I thought. Returning from my errands the next day, I found the shop in disarray, clear signs of a struggle and my mother nowhere to be found; the pendant she always wore lying in a pile of broken spice pots. In the midst of my panic my fingers found the egg, still in my pocket, and a surge of wild magic more powerful than any I’d felt before swept through me in a whirlwind. When I found my feet again I was on a mountainside, far away from any civilisation.It took me months to make my way back to the city. I survived on what I could forage, grateful of my mother’s teachings about herbs and which plants were edible or poisonous. During this time I learned that the orb focuses and strengthens my spells, but I will never entirely trust it.  When I did finally make it back to the shop, it was boarded up and any hope of a trail to lead me to my mother had long disappeared. Since then I’ve made my own way through the world, scraping a living where I could with my knowledge of herbs and poisons, and with my magical abilities. I am always on the lookout for clues that could lead me to my mother. I am always looking over my shoulder for those that took her."5/3/2018 15:14:31,Prime Guide,Tabaxi,Ranger,Growing up he had a growing interest in other cultures.

But, it turned out her true talents lay elsewhere. As her first assignment, she was posted to a garrison in a remote village, not far from the border of the land. Undermanned and mismanaged, the garrison took constant hits from raiding parties. It was clear that leadership was lacking, so Leif rose to fill the position. She quickly advanced through the ranks, and was eventually trusted with managing the garrison in this remote outpost. There, she befriended a priest of Gorm Gulthyn, who showed her the strength of faith and the power gained through it, and taught her the ways of his god: watchfulness, vigilance, defense, protection of the dwarven people. As her faith grew stronger, so did her friendship with the cleric, Angal. Until one day, when her world was turned upside down. A duergar raiding party, catching the garrison completely by surprise, massacred the population of the village and captured the few high-ranking individuals residing there, torturing them to extract information, killing them when they were done. Leif was taken aside to be questioned, discovering that the one who betrayed the garrison was her friend, the priest. Instead of taking her life, he let her go. That day, she swore an oath in the name of her god - not Angal's god anymore, as he had clearly betrayed him too.

She wasn't convinced she was a psychic but after several years she had already committed so much it would be too much to just drop the act. The turning point of her career was when she had a show about the curing power that love and compassion can have. On this controversial episode, she found a local suburban home where their dog was getting really sick. ""Place your hands. Like this. Firmly there between Chomper's shoulders."" Ruth and the mother of the house gently touched Chomper's back. ""Now feel all the love you can feel! Feel the love I feel. Feel the love you have for Chompers, your kids, your husband!"" The mother looked to her children who were standing a distance crying, and looked back at the dog. After but a moment Ruth's hand glowed an almost imperceptible divine light. Chomper's health had improved! He lifted his little chihuahua snout and wagged his tail lying there on the doggy bed. The religiously inclined condemned the show, but the controversy brought in a wider audience, and with it more supporters. She continued to do shows like this, until she caught the attention of the Shroud of Colors. A group whose goal is recruit people with magical powers to help keep dangerous magical beings, including the incoming Rakshasa threat, under wraps."5/3/2018 18:52:33,Nemar Pot,Sea Elf,Monk,Zen Fisherwoman.5/3/2018 19:29:28,Cadence,Tiefling,Warlock,"He woke up with amnesia, before finding out he had become the god of chaos and music.

was fighting off an orc raid on his lands, and led an attack into one of their forward operating camps, butchering everyone there in a preventative measureIn the rubble, he discovered an infant, a half-orc baby girl, and in a fit of compassion saw fit to bring her home and adopt herThough he had made his name fighting off the greenskin horde, he did not see it as a permanent solution and neither did he wish to commit genocideHe wanted to bring her up to be a civil member of society, to prove orcs aren’t inherently evil or beyond redemptionHis foundling child was not well-loved by the court back home, let alone his own familyHis wife and eldest son in particular disdained the girl, now dubbed RaelFor a time, the lord managed to use his influence to keep such opinions at bayEventually, however, his health began to fail himAs the lord grew sicker and more bedridden, Rael’s life grew harderAs the lady gained more control over the household, Rael received less and less attentionThis also translated into less and less protection from those who would bully her, chief among whom was her adoptive older brotherRael retreated to her father’s side as often as possible, but his illness often left him sleeping and the lady gleefully used this as an excuse to drive her away from that safe havenHer father still influenced Rael, and he spoke often of the example he wanted her to beEventually, Rael’s father died, and the gloves came offThe bullying became physical, but as Rael was attacked, she discovered a rage inside herself that let her fight backThese fights still remained minor scuffles without permanent injury, but only because Rael fought to control and direct her rageShe directed it towards self-improvement rather than sheer destruction, training herself to always be one step ahead of her bulliesTensions between Rael and her “family” continued to grow, until something finally brokeA family of distant relations came to visit, among them a charming young man Rael’s age, who to her surprise quickly began to act warm, flirtatious even, towards herRael was completely unprepared, for though she as a young woman had longed for a romantic connection she had not found anyone she could connect with when most people either loathed her or feared herThus she was swept off her feet in quick successionThe budding relationship grew intense as the family’s departure grew closer, and on the final night Rael’s paramour snuck to her room and spent the night with herRael woke to find him gone, and she went out to find him for a bittersweet goodbyeInstead, she found him in a circle of young men, bragging about how he had tamed and bedded the she-beastAs they spotted Rael their derision only grew, and among their number was Rael’s brother, who reveal he had masterminded the whole thingRael lost control of her rage and fell upon him, beating him to the groundShe did not stay behind to be punished, instead packing what little possessions she had and heading out to make herself a life on the road, using her considerable martial prowess to make ends meetRael continues to harbor mixed feelings over what happened: though her brother certainly had the beating coming, in delivering it she failed to live up to her father’s dream of herOnly a few years past, the event is still fresh on her mind, and for now she is content to not reflect on how she feels about her old life, figuring she’ll cross that bridge when she comes to itThough she doesn’t know or doesn’t care, Rael is undeniably Lady Rael of House Montrain, a member of nobility: her father took every precaution to ensure her position and claim could not be discredited once he had passed awayRael is a sullen, fierce woman, who never backs down from a fight or lets an insult go unanswered; she has had a scarce few trusted friends in her life and that fierceness extends to their defense – that is to say, she will do virtually anything for a friend, and anything to an enemyHer rage is a double-edged sword: it is directed as much at herself as at her enemy, for she both feels conflicted about failing her father’s dream and has absorbed some of the hatred directed at her for her entire life"5/3/2018 22:27:56,Larin,Half-elf,Cavalier,"For a time, Larin had a picturesque childhood, raised in a peaceful community by loving, half-elven parents who made a modest living as merchantsAnd yet, one day tragedy struck, and travelers arriving into town found it deserted, empty of all life save for a crying child – LarinThe whole matter was deeply unsettling in its mysteriousness, and unable or unwilling to entertain other possibilities, the tragedy was chalked up to raiders, presumably having come through and enslaved everyoneThat did not explain the lack of looting or signs of resistance, but people decided to let sleeping dogs lieLarin might have been able to tell them more, but the girl had been dumb and mute since whatever happenedA month or so later, a strange rider came to town, looking equal parts like a wandering mystic and a roving warriorHe asked around about the mystery of Larin’s town, and in so doing earned himself an ill reputation as someone who went digging into things better left aloneDespite resistance, he managed to arrange a meeting with LarinHe asked if she had seen them – the dark figures arriving, the thick fog rolling in to cover the streets, and the unspeakable something stalking in itSlowly, Larin turned to look him in the eyes – the first recognition of another person since the event – and said, “yes”Against any protests – of which there weren’t many – the rider took Larin with him as he left town, saying none here could help herThe rider was in fact a knight, of the Order of the Eastern Star, dedicated to protecting innocents from otherworldly threats that few knew even existedA cult he’d long hunted had been behind what happened to Larin’s homeHe brought Larin to the Order’s base of operations, so that they could help her however they could and find out whatever she knew in the processOnce they were done, the question arose of what to do with herShe couldn’t be taken back – she’d be ostracized forever as cursed by ill fateAs they debated turning her over to an orphanage, Larin made her will known:She wanted to stay, and she wanted to helpFrom that day on, Larin entered training to become a Cavalier of the Eastern Star, and among her peers her determination was second to noneShe proved to be an unorthodox member, brash and blunt where most of their number were subtle and cryptic – but none could deny that she was dedicated, and got resultsOne day, though she wasn’t quite yet done with her training, when she heard her savior and mentor had fallen to the cult he still hunted, she insisted that she be recognized as a full-fledged knight and sent out to continute his workShe did not take no for an answer, and in a matter of days set out to investigate his death, and follow any leads she found"5/3/2018 22:28:22,Syvas,Elf,Druid,"Syvas was born into a fairly normal life in a human settlementHe showed his intellect early on and was set on the track for an academic lifeSyvas’ years in the academy were marked by a sea change in the society around him, where liberal upstarts sought to challenge the conservative power base of the cityUncharacteristically for an elf, Syvas took a great interest in these events and threw his lot in with those academics who joined the struggleHe was young and idealistic, and relished the chance to change the worldTo everyone’s surprise the liberals won, and in a series of abdications, impromptu elections and hushed coups inserted themselves into the positions of power the conservatives had once heldAt first, there was a sense of hope in the air – anything was possible! – and Syvas was immensely proud of having done his small part to bring this aboutYet, nothing changed: the liberal leaders now in power changed very little, mostly acting only to shore up their own positions, all in the name of “stability”A few years passed and truly, nothing had changed, and Syvas grew bitter and cynicalHe had become increasingly withdrawn at the academy and now chose to withdraw from civilized life entirelyHe had always had a fascination for the natural world and focused his studies as such, and now he chose to devote his life entirely to itNatural wonders were permanent and incorruptible, he said, and thus the only thing truly worthy of study (and not fickle like people, he sometimes added)Syvas took to wandering the world, cataloguing the wonders of nature he saw, which eventually set him in touch with a circle of druidsAfter Syvas insisted for a good long while they inducted him into the druidic orderSyvas never became a traditional druid, as his focus was always on learning and understanding the secrets of the natural worldThat said, his colleagues could never question his devotion to the GreenHis druidic training complete, Syvas took to the road again, ever seeking to learn more"5/3/2018 22:28:57,Cyral Valant,Half-elf,Fighter,"Cyral was born into a troupe of traveling entertainers, and spent his early childhood with them on the road, very much a part of the traveling lifeHis parents wasted no time grooming him into an entertainer, and taught him the guitarWhile still a young boy of less than ten, he was abducted during the troupe’s travelsHe was transported far, and by various means, until finally arriving in an underground complex where he was to be held captive along with other children of various kindsThey were separated into specific groups, any given group consisting of different racesTheir captors were also a mixed bunch: though the ones giving the orders were all elves, those taking the orders were from a variety of backgroundsOver time, children would be added or taken out to ensure everyone in the group was roughly on the same level of maturationThe youths began to be trained under threat of violence, first engaging in just basic physical conditioning, but soon enough moving into combat drillsThis went on for years, at which point their captors began to also experiment on them, giving them various alchemical extracts to enhance their bodiesRumors spread among the youths of vivisections and awful transformationsThe youths often turned to each other for companionship and comfort, as they had no one else, and Cyral was no differentThis training and experimentation continued so long that Cyral no longer remembered any other life, or even his own nameHis elven captors called him Lhast (an antiquated insult for half-elves) and he thought that was his nameSome children clung to their memories of time before, while others now firmly believed they had always been thereAs their training progressed, they were organized into new groups, and these groups then made to fight each other as part of one-on-one duels and drills but also a variety of scenarios in groupsEach group was branded with a symbol and a number to denote where they belongedAt this stage the combat training grew more intense, and the trainers began to goad the youths into competing more and more, driving them to resent the other groupsAs things escalated, so did the violence, and some of the youths began to die in the course of the trainingLhast took a rival’s life during training – his first kill, and it shook him to his coreHis performance fell after that, much to the chagrin of his handlersLhast knew his fate now hung in the balance, for if he didn’t improve his performance to previous levels and beyond, either the handlers or the other groups would kill himIn the nick of time there was some kind of accident in the laboratory the elves ran, and Lhast managed to use the opportunity to escape, though only barelyHe found himself a stranger in a strange land, and on the run to bootHe did not know how much damage had been done to the operation, whether it still existed, whether anyone was after him, but he couldn’t afford to take any chancesFor a long time he simply fled, stealing and stowing away to make his wayAfter several months with no-one after him, he finally calmed downLhast was confronted with the terrifying reality of freedom: no one could tell him what to do with his lifeAnd yet, he also had no concept of life: all he had were memories of life in training, though thankfully ever since his first kill he had begun to shake off the mental conditioning imposed upon himHis one and only skillset was as a warrior, bolstered by the mutations of the elves’ experiments, and that was the trade he began to ply, a mercenary and adventurerHe still disliked killing the innocent, but held no such reservations towards anyone dangerous or deservingIn the back of his mind, he still has two goals: discovering who his captors were, and who he wasHe has made little progress in either direction, as no one has recognized him or the symbol he is branded withBy chance he discovered a familiarity with music: passing a troupe, he recognized the tune they were playingHe asked to see one of their guitars, and old insticts kicked in to awkwardly pick out a melody and some chordsAlas, the troupe could offer no other clues as to his identityLhast did acquire a guitar and began to practice playing it on his own, to foster some sense of connection to the life he lost"5/3/2018 22:29:20,Gared Giel,Human,Gunslinger,"Angels quite literally heralded the birth of Gared Giel, and scores of paladins and clerics came to his parents’ doorThe Giels weren’t exactly shocked, as the glowing skin and silver hair of their son marked him as something extraordinaryThe holy men said that Gared was blessed with divine potency that could only be realized if he was given over to training for a holy purposeThe Giels agreed, somewhat relieved to not shoulder such a heavy burdenGared was taken to a fortress-monastery for training, and his divine powers continued to manifest themselvesThough he wasn’t particularly keen on any of his studies, the various orders squabbled over whose ranks he would joinThat he said, he was equally uninterested in most of them, until he chanced upon a firing exercise of the Holy Guns, and was enthralledThough he had now found his calling, as Gared grew older he chafed in monastic trainingHis first attempt to escape was entirely successful and he made his way to a nearby city and tried to make the most of it, robbing a merchant to pay for a spending spreeGared’s guardians weren’t far behind and easily caught up with him, bringing him back to the fortress-monastery to be punishedThis marked the beginning of a troublesome time for Gared, as he continued to try and escape, succeeding more often than not, yet brought back every timeEach time he headed to nearby cities to indulge in the delights denied to him, and each time he was brought back he grew more resistant to his captors, until he went for broke in one last escape attemptThis time he didn’t beeline for earthly delights but instead kept going, traveling further and further away until he was sure nobody was following himHis overbearing divine protectors a distant memory, Gared set about making a life for himself as a gun-for-hire, establishing a reputation as a hard-shooting, hard-drinking mercenaryWhile some of this was certainly to his liking, some of it was simply to make himself as much unlike the divine warrior he had been destined to beEventually he cooled on the act, though he still remained morally questionableHe now makes a comfortable living as an adventurer and very insistently does not think on any greater destiny he might haveThe order that raised him is still searching for him, though they’ve yet to find him in this great, big world"5/3/2018 22:30:02,Bubbles,Human,Black Guardian,"Some adventurers found a goldfish sitting in a pool of blood in the great labyrinth. They later went to explore some ancient ruins, and, in a puff of blue flame, Bubbles's bowl broke, releasing the former goldfish. He has very little memory from before being a goldfish, but he speaks the language of the labyrinth. This leads the other adventurers to think that he has some connection to the labyrinth."5/3/2018 22:30:21,Yvain Sunchild,Dhampir,Inquisitor,"Yvain was abandoned in the graveyard in the dead of winter, and it was only by chance that a cleric from the temple of Sarenrae happened upon herShe was taken into the temple and raised there by the clergy, along with other orphansHer half-vampire nature was soon discovered, and since Sarenrae loves the redeemed evil-doer it only served to further impress the need for the clergy to raise this childYvain grew up peacefully in the temple, and excelled in her academic as well as divine studiesShe was a charming and well-loved childAs she came into her teens she discovered the truth about her own nature, and that she was the offspring of an evil creatureThe discovery continued to gnaw at her, and she obsessed over it, but she kept said obsession secret from the clergy, who she knew would frown up on itAs Yvain grew into a young woman, her obsession took a new shape – discovering her fatherShe delved into both city records, and then rumors on the street, and after months of hopeless work finally discovered there was indeed a vampire operating in the cityWith further work, she discovered the vampire was actually a local nobleman, influential and well-loved, an active philanthropistShe went to confront her father, and to her surprise he was delighted to see her, and offered to take her under his wingThey were so alike after all, he said – she had clearly inherited the easy, manipulative Moroi charmYvain rejected the offer, and fledYvain was disgusted by the claim of similarity between her and this murderous fiend, and yet she could not entirely refute itHer teachers doted on her, and with the onset of adolescence many of her peers had fallen for her charms, and she had even taken one of them as a loverNow Yvain pushed her away, convinced the love between them was only an infatuation brought on by her vampiric natureA heavy guilt settled into Yvain’s heart, and she saw only one way to redeem herselfShe went to the city authorities to expose her father’s crimes and bring him to justice, only to discover that none were willing to do anything about itRumors she heard suggested that her father’s misdeeds were not unknown (though his vampirism was) but that his money and influence left him immuneShe then went to the clergy, champions of good, to urge them to take actionThey took the accusations seriously, but insisted on following proper procedure (which involved gettting in touch with higher-ups in the faith)Yvain was furious that people refused to do anything about an active evildoer in their midst, and saw no choice but to take matters into her own handsShe went to confront her father, and issued an ultimatum – either he would turn himself in to face for his crimes, or she’d bring him in by forceHer father laughed at her, and so she struck – a feeble attempt were it not for Sarenrae infusing her power into the blowYvain’s father’s face burst into flame and she took the opportunity to fleeIn the church they debated what to do with her, knowing that Yvain’s father would use his influence to send the authorities after herYvain decided to take matters into her own hands once again and prepared to run away so as to not bring undue attention on the churchIt was during her escape that some of Sarenrae’s inquisitors found her, and recognizing her dedication to their cause, welcomed her inNow a trained inquisitor, Yvain travels the land to root out evil, vampires in particularThough still dedicated to Sarenrae, she has found her purpose in taking revenge on evildoers who refuse to reform, rather than let them escape justice due to compassionSome question if this is truly Sarenrae’s way, but the goddess’ blessings continue to manifest in Yvain’s powersAs Yvain grew older her vampiric thirst also manifested itselfInitially she tried to simply resist, but the attempt almost killed herNow she feeds this unfortunate addiction with blood from volunteers, as well as non-humanoid substitutes if pressed"5/3/2018 22:31:19,Federic Valant,Human,Magus,"Federic was born to the esteemed Valant family, much to the relief of his relativesHe was not the first child of his generation, as his older brother had died and left the line without an heir – and many had feared his parents were too old for another childHis parents took perhaps an overzealous approach to ensuring Federic’s safety, forbidding dangerous physical activity, like the sword arts his older brother had fanciedInstead, he was directed towards a more academic pathFederic, however, had a young boy’s drive for the rough-and-tumble, and made a close friend doing exactly that in the guard captain’s sonWhere Federic was being pushed towards education, the captain’s son was pushed towards trainingThe two boys exchanged lessons in their spare time, Federic learning how to fight and the captain’s son in the fundamentals of knowledgeThis reciprocity continued even as they got older and Federic entered the academy, and his friend the ranks of the guardsIn the academy, Federic discovered an aptitude for the arcaneThe Valants were old, rich and powerful, and such status breeds rival and enemiesOne family in particular rankled at playing second fiddle to the ValantsThough they maintained appearances, everyone knew they coveted the power and position the Valants enjoyedEven as a young boy, Federic took quickly to prideful nobility, and absorbed the contentious attitude the Valants held towards their upstart rivalsDuring an event where both families were gathered, Federic went and humiliated his counterpart, the scion of the other familyThough most of the family and their allies laughed it off and congratulated Federic on his daring, his father feared he was just adding fuel to the fire of their rival’s enmityHe was not wrong – while Federic, now a young man, was away attending to his studies, his parents were assassinatedFederic returned in time to see their rivals declare open war on the flimsiest of pretextsHe did not hesitate in abandoning his studies in order to take up the sword and fight for his birthright, now as the head of the Valant familyThough Federic was eager and determined, he was an untested commander, and too brash and angry to follow the advice of wiser menDespite his best efforts, the war was lost – the rivals assumed control of the Valants’ lands and responsibilities, fully replacing themFederic was driven out – presumed dead by some – and those loyal who remained instructed him to flee far away and live to fight another dayThough it pained him to do so, that is exactly what he didHe fled to a distant land and started a new life, plying his skill at combining magic and martial mightThough ostensibly a mere adventurer, he continues to plot his eventual return and retaking of his birthright, and revenge on his rivalsFeder is arrogant but dedicated; he believes he is entitled to his noble position but he is willing to fight for it; he has a very high opinion of himself; he is loyal to those who are loyal to him; he does not view allies as disposable; he believes his synthesis of the martial and the arcane makes him a peerless warrior, and he’ll fight to prove it"5/3/2018 22:32:00,Kasachi,Tengu,Oracle,"Kasachi was born to a traditional Tengu home and had a traditional Tengu upbringing, until tragedy struck: an earthquake shook their mountain home, and Kasachi’s parents were among the many who diedThe local monastery took him in though he was inconsolableSorrow had such a grip on him that he would not eatHoping to help the boy, the abbott taught him about ancestral rites, and that his parents were still watching over him, even if they were doing so from the spirit world, as were all his other ancestorsWith the abbott’s guidance, Kasachi spoke to his parents at the family shrine, and the boy seemed to find some measure of comfort in thatKasachi became one of the temple youths, instructed in religious teaching as well as martial artsWhenever he had the time he’d slip away to the shrine and speak with his parentsWhat struck the monks as odd, however, was that he claimed they were speaking back – and that he had conversations with themWhile quaint, it was ignored, until one time when a monk called out to Kasachi during such a conversation, and it was a voice other than his that answeredAfter some investigation, it became clear that the spirits could work through Kasachi, also unlocking divine magic within himFrom then on, Kasachi was revered as special in his ability to commune with the spirit world, and his training was modified to enhance his spiritual abilitiesEventually, having grown into an amiable young man, Kasachi took to the road, hoping that new experiences would deepen his connection to the spirit world, aiming one day to truly become one with them, a bridge between the two worlds"5/3/2018 22:32:22,Roog,Goblin,Paladin,"Roog was born to a typical goblin tribe but he was un-typically smart for a goblin child. While this might have meant he may have risen to a position of power in the tribe, the tribe was wiped out before that managed to happen. Roog survived only by miraculous happenstance, and the goblin child wandered about in search of a means of survival. Eventually he strayed near a human settlement, where he made a pitiable impression on a local villager, and she gave him enough food for him to survive.Roog understood he would never be accepted by the village, but he remained in its vicinity. A handful of individuals were privy to the secret of his existence, and in return for their kindness Roog did what he could to help the village: foraging the land, locating missing items, driving off small predators and warning about larger ones. The village was located near a major highway and travelers often passed through. Roog inadvertently made friends with a traveling merchant, who would see Roog whenever he was in the area. He regaled the goblin with tales of the world, and had a small treat for him to eat while he listened.One day, a particularly large goblin horde struck the town unbeknownst to Roog. He returned only once the attack was underway, and the village aflame. Terrified, he wandered through the chaos, and sought refuge in the small temple to Desna in the village. Hiding, quaking in fear, the goblin waited for the violence to pass, until some of the attacking goblins found their way into the temple. Roog couldn’t stand the idea of them despoiling it, and as he  looked up to Desna’s shrine he felt a new courage in his heart. Picking up a fallen weapon, he charged at his kinsmen and slew them. He suffered injuries of his own in the process, but that was when he felt a power inside him that allowed him to recover. Energized, Roog charged outside but the attack was over, the goblins gone and the village destroyed. And by a cruel twist of fate, even the traveling merchant had been caught and killed. At first, Roog mourned, but in time he realized that it was never too late to use his newfound powers to help others. He swore his loyalty to Desna, vowing to protect the helpless and fight the wicked, goblins in particular. Before departing, he took a symbol of Desna from the temple to remember the village by.Roog is extremely dedicated to his cause and is quite humorless about it. He is stern, stalwart, and strong. He is absolutely an inspiring figure, although that is easily ignored because of his goblinoid nature. He is given to disguising his features with hood or helmet and passing as a halfling."5/3/2018 22:32:45,Hush,Tiefling,Ranger,"An unknown figure of unknown provenance abandoned a child in the midst of a forest during the heart of winterA close look at the child would reveal why: she was clearly tainted by infernal bloodAnd yet, by all accounts she would have died, save for two things:Her unnaturally high body heat kept her from freezingA pack of wolves found her, and somehow kept her aliveThe nameless child grew up with the pack, hunting with them, though as she grew older she began to use her wiles to hunt better, construcing tools to help her effortsLife in the wild was still tough, and she had to watch many of the pack members die, despite her best efforts to save themAs she grew into adulthood, an unease settled into the tiefling – a longing for something that the pack could not fillOne day, a group of hunters ran afoul of the pack and conflict broke outThanks to the tiefling, the hunters were outmatched and quickly killed, save for oneHe’d seen his companions try and fail to reason with her, so he tried communicating with her in a simpler fashion, indicating surrenderIt worked and she let him liveThe hunter was fascinated by the tiefling and remained in the area, trying to establish communication with herThough he failed, the tiefling was drawn to this creature who was like herHe eventually gave up trying – he wasn’t the man for this job – but to his surprise when he left she followed him, eager to see what else the world had to offerThe hunter tried taking her to his hometown, but she was scared off by the jarring changeShe stayed in the nearby woods by herself and the hunter came out to visit herHe eventually brought a local scholar out, and she managed to start teaching the rudiments of language to the tieflingDuring these lessons she came by the name ‘Hush’ – an admonition from the scholar, but she liked the sound, as it was simple and reminded her of the windHush never learned to read, but learned enough of speaking that she could pick the rest up on her ownThe hunter took Hush under his wing while she adjusted to the civilized world, and they traveled the world together, finding work as adventurersHush got acclimated to civilization in steps, eventually to the point where she could stay inside a small, bustling city, though she remained nervous and on edgeBut the hunter was not a young man anymore, and life on the road wore on himHe met a woman in one of the villages they operated around, and she eventually asked him to settle down with herHush was equal parts hurt and confused by the turn of events, as she didn’t understand relationships and understood a marriage even lessIt felt like her only companion was leaving her for someone elseThe hunter suggested she stay in the area to work, and they could still see each otherBut Hush was now gripped with an unshakeable wanderlust, and so she took the road on her own"5/3/2018 22:33:19,Vad,Hobgoblin,Rogue,"By what means Vad escaped the oppressive, militaristic hobgoblin society and came to be a young orphan on the streets of a metropolis, nobody knows and he’s long since forgottenHe was one of many street urchins, standing out only due to his unusual heritage and aptitude for getting into high places – and into troubleAs he grew older, a criminal gang set their sights on him and his talents, and easily enlisted the impressionable young boy into their serviceVad didn’t much care for justice but he did like helping people, and the criminals exploited this desire by inventing charitable explanations for the crimes Vad committed for themIt was only as Vad grew into a young man that he began putting two and two together, and realized that all he’d been helping was the gang boss grow rich and fatWith a dark resolve, Vad crafted a plan to kill the boss in revenge, and to loosen his hold on the poor areas of the cityThe plan worked, although Vad did not escape suspicion in the aftermathVad waited for things to get better, and urged the new leadership to focus their efforts on helping the city poor that the city officials ignoredThe gang didn’t share his altruism, and the new boss was much the same as the oldVad went for the kill again, but this time failed, and was forced on the runVad went into hiding, but observed the situation developThe assassination attempt, though failed, was seen as a sign of weakness on the boss’ part, and a rival gang soon finished the job Vad had startedBut things once again turned for the worse, despite Vad’s proddingHe set his sights on the rival boss, but was discovered before he could attackVad fled the city and struck out onto the road, eager to leave behind the city and his failuresThere were more people being exploited, and he could help them – by blade if necessary…"5/3/2018 22:33:43,Zalash,Orc,Rogue,"Zalash was born into slavery, working in a mine run by some humans who thought to get payback on orc cruelties by using them as cheap slave laborLife in the mine wasn’t easy, and backbreaking labor was the name of the game from the second she was old enough to workThe slaves, mostly comprising of orcs, were a chaotic group to be part of, and even downtime from work was marked by a constant struggle to surviveThe only comfort Zalash found was in an old half-orc man locked up with them, a cleric of Cayden Cailean, who soothed the young woman by telling her stories of his travelsThe stories enchanted her and she resolved to get out of the mines and see the things she had only heard about for herselfZalash bode her time, stealing food, coin and valuable items and stashing them away – an activity that also trained her skill as a thief, skulk and sneaky fighterEventually she was ready, and tried to persuade the cleric to flee with her, but his body had been broken by the work and he said he’d only slow her downHe gave her a tankard blazoned with his god’s symbol, and bid her to return it to his templeZalash managed to flee successfully and struck out on her ownHer first order of business was to return the cleric’s tankard, and when she did the temple welcomed her with open arms, and she was happy to join the faithSince then she’s become an adventurer, mostly happy to just see her own way, but always willing to join the cause of freedom, as she cannot stand to see anyone chained"5/3/2018 22:34:49,Orath,Human,Sorcerer,"Orath’s birth was prophesied, but he wasn’t the culmination of the prophecy – rather, he was  just a step along the wayHe grew up in a sedate cult in the heart of a distant desert, remembering no other lifeLife in the cult was simple, but also easy and relatively carefreeOrath seemed preternaturally lucky, ever since he was a toddler, and events around him seemed to work out in a certain way, as if it was meant to beIn his teens his sorcerous powers awakened, once again through good fortuneHe also grew close to a girl his age in the cult, and after their early teens were spent in awkward flirtation, as they entered young adulthood romance blossomedAnd yet, as Orath grew older he also began to question his life in the cultPiecing together rumors, overheard conversations and a few secrets gleaned by sneaking into places he shouldn’t have gone he discovered a terrible truth:The cult was in fact evil, dedicated to bringing about the age of evil by fostering a child as powerful as he was evilFirst Orath thought he was the child, but he soon realized that he was in fact the one supposed to sire the child, his young love to be the motherOrath resolved to escape, rather than risk bringing about this destroyer of worldsHe went to his young love and begged her to come with himShe seemed to go along with the plan, but betrayed him at the last minute to the cult – it turned out she was entirely aware of her role in the prohecyOrath managed to escape the double-cross through his miraculous luck, and quickly got as far from the cult as possibleOrath has since become an adventurer, mainly because the dangerous, roving lifestyle means he is unlikely to be found and likely to die childlessThe cult is still after him, hoping to take what they can by force or by trickeryAn order of divine warriors has caught wind of the prophecy and also hunts Orath, insisting he either die or castrate himself "5/3/2018 22:35:18,Essandra,Human,Sorcerer,"Essandra’s mother died giving birth to her, as she had known she would long before she even conceived a daughterHer father had learned of this inevitability only recently, and was still processingEssandra was cursed from birth, as had been her mother, and her mother’s mother, all the way back up the family tree as far as anyone knewMore specifically, her soul was cursed to be reborn again, and again, and again, always into her daughter’s body, her daughter effectively becoming herThe soul does not forget, and as Essandra would grow older the memories of past lives would begin crowding her mind, driving her insaneHer soul had something it had to do on this earth, and she wouldn’t be free of this curse of rebirth until she didEssandra’s mother relayed this to her husband in one of the few moments of clarity she had before she died, apologizing for keeping it a secret but begging him to prepare their daughter for what still awaited herShe thrust into his hands her most treasured possession: a journal, kept by her predecessors – damaged and cryptic, and all the information she hadFinding it had been her life’s work, after the several incarnations before her had tried to push their curse well out of mind, only to failShe hoped her daughter could use it to finally end the curseEssandra’s father ultimately took the charge seriously and resolved to prepare his daughter for whatever might come her wayAt first, he feared that he would damage her, ruin her childhood, but it soon became apparent that Essandra’s childhood wouldn’t be easy either way – bad dreams became a constant companion at an early age, presaging what would eventually befall herThus, as soon as she was old enough, he began teaching her whatever he couldCombat he knew best, for he was a retired soldier, but he tried to teach her other practical skillsAs her dreams unlocked her magical potential, he knew he couldn’t help her with those and instead hired the best teachers he could to guide herAs soon as she was old enough to comprehend it, he explained to Essandra what all the training had been for, and what awaited her – and then, as instructed, he passed on the journalIn truth, Essandra was relieved to finally have an explanation for the dark things that had haunted her all her lifeNow it wasn’t some mysterious darkness hanging overhead; as daunting as the task was, it was something she could actively engageShe stayed with her father for several more years, preparing herself, before finally deciding she was old enough to strike out and discover her destiny"5/3/2018 22:35:39,Zharda,Orc,Summoner,"Zharda was something of a peculiarity amidst the orc slaves she was born into, for she was uncommon smart for an orc of no particular breedingThis did her no favors, however, and she had a difficult childhood, often the runt of the litter and the focus of everyone’s ire for her “big head”She continued to be picked on until she could take it no longer, and she called for anyone, anything, to help her defend herselfIn her desperation, she managed to call an eidolon – a bloodthirsty little thing – and she wasted no time in setting it upon her tormentorsAfter that episode, the tribe’s warriors were fighting each other for who could take the strange creature down, but the tribe shaman interruptedHe said it was an emissary from Nulgreth, an aspect of the Blood God sent here, and since it showed Zharda loyalty that meant she was Nulgreth’s chosenNone could argue the point, as the creature truly was vicious when it foughtZharda’s life changed, and the shamans and witch doctors began grooming her into one of their ownZharda, however, was having none of itShe remained disillusioned with the orc way of life – having been brought up as a slave among them, she was disinclined to lead anyone else to the same fateNeither did she desire to kill in the name of the tribe, to empower those who had abused their power over her for so longFor now, she could do little about it, and acquiesced, happy to spend her days developing a greater connection to RenekAs she grew older she grew only less sympathetic towards her kinEventually it was deemed that she was ready to test her abilities on the field of battle, and the chieftain bade her to join the warriorsAnd in front of the whole tribe, Zharda told him to go fuck himselfWhen the chieftain made it clear he wouldn’t take no for an answer, Zharda set Renek upon him and, in a lucky blow, took him down in one fell swoopAfter some initial confusion, a score of warriors charged at her, but together she and Renek held them at bayAs soon as she had a moment to speak, Zharda declared she’d had enough of all of it, and that she would be leaving and would kill anyone who tried to stop herNone didZharda and Renek took to the road, hoping to make a new life for themselves as adventurersZharda retains her hatred of slavers, tyrants and bullies, making short work of their ilkHer old tribe continues to debate the line of succession, as whoever kills the chieftain takes that position, and no chieftain in history has ever simply walked awayThough there is resistance, Zharda is technically the chieftain of her tribe Some warriors desiring the position have gone out in search of her to kill her and take her position That said, she hasn’t given the matter any thought and is unaware "5/3/2018 22:36:04,Basaan,Sylph,Warlock,"Basaan was born to a family of traveling travelers, and had a relatively peaceful childhoodEverything went awry, however, when his extraplanar heritage was discovereSuddenly everyone looked at him a little differently, and poor young Basaan felt helpless and adrift with his life having taken such an unexpected turnsHis aunt, trying to give him some comfort, taught him how to use a Harrow deck for divination, so that he could try and find some answers or meaning that wayBasaan took to the deck like he was born to it, and soon he became the best fortuneteller the family had ever counted among their lineageSome of the mistrust from the troupe abated as Basaan proved his worth by raking in cash from his readings wherever they wentThough he didn’t mention it to anyone for fear of appearing even stranger, Basaan had also discovered some sort of magic in the Harrow deckWith the invocation of his powers through the deck, Basaan became obsessed with the HarrowHe spent his spare time absorbed in doing readings of it, or poring over tomes that spoke of the Harrow’s historyHe heard of the original Harrow decks from which the others are descended, and of magical decks like the one that could lead him to the Harrow RealmIf he got there, he would find answersWhen he was old enough, Basaan announced he would be departing the troupeThough he said it was to simply grow into his own and see more of the world, in truth he wanted the freedom to hone his connection to the Harrow as well as his research and not fear the judgment of the troupeBidding goodbye to his parents, he set out on his search"5/3/2018 22:36:27,Maldir,Elf,Wizard," Maldir was born a second child, the youngster to his brother MenathelMenathel was even at an early age very much the golden child, the pride of his parents and the community around himHis parents decided to go for seconds, hoping to repeat their successAnd yet, from his very birth, Maldir was flawed and troublesome, as if somehow taintedHis birth was difficult and even as a baby he never smiled, only wore a perpetual scowlAs he grew older, Maldir proved to be sickly and weakFearing failure, his parents pushed him to study, hoping he could blossom there without his physical shortcomings becoming too obviousMeanwhile, Menathel continued to excel and their parents doted on him, showering him with love where they pressured Maldir to performThus Maldir grew deeply jealous and resentful of his brotherAs they grew older, Maldir and Menathel had a difficult relationshipMaldir continued to resent him, and while Menathel was aware he tried to remain unaffected in hopes of finally winning Maldir overThis only served to embitter Maldir further, as he thought his brother was being aloof, refusing to acknowledge his feelingsMenathel began to drift towards a more martial path, training to become a rangerMaldir was to be a wizard, but he was proving to be meager rather than mighty This was much to the chagrin of his parents, and they pushed him furtherMaldir desperately wanted to become a more powerful magic-user, convinced that could somehow fix his lifeHe began hearing whispers at the edge of things, a voice that had somehow always been there though he had never heard itThat voice promised him power, and as Maldir listened his studies began to improveAnd yet, it was never enough for his parentsThe voice spoke of other things as well, and fed his bitterness towards his familyThe years went by, and things got worseMaldir continued his studies, while Menathel got his induction into the rangersNot long after, he received a promotionMenathel hurried home to tell everyone, and only Maldir happened to be thereMaldir grew unhappy when he heard the news, knowing this would only be cause for his parents to further pressure himMenathel, having finally had enough, became uncharacteristically upset with Maldir’s poor attitude, and scolded him for itMaldir shook with fury – his brother, to whom everything had been handed on a silver platter – dared to lecture him on his attitude?Maldir lashed out, and caught his brother by surprisePanic set in as Mandir realized his brother was dyingHe attempted a dangerous, desperate magic ritual, hoping to bind his brother’s spirit into something before it was too lateThe only living thing nearby was Menathel’s osprey companionThe ritual was successful, and Menathel – whatever remained of him – was now inside the bird, which was now in turn bonded to MaldirMaldir couldn’t bring himself to face his parents, or anyone he knew, and so he gathered what little possessions he had and fled, and kept fleeing until he was far, far away from anything familiar "5/3/2018 22:36:54,Arrol Roon,Tiefling,Alchemist,"The Roon family hailed from the distant mountains of Kerth, leading a simple life in a frontier town. They prided themselves on their faith and piety, as there was little choice in the matter living in such a small, remote community. Members of the family who had turned from the faith had all left the town, some to eventually return with their faith restored, some to stay gone forever. The former were accepted back, though still spoken of disapprovingly out of earshot. The latter were openly condemned, and their absence approved of.Imagine, then, the shock when their latest generation’s second son was born with a clear infernal taint: ashen, scaly skin and horns jutting from his scalp. Poor Arrol Roon was never going to have an easy life, if he was going to have one at all. His mother died in childbirth, and his existence tainted his family by association. Though his father was known to be a pious man, aspersions were now cast upon him, seeking to explain how this abomination had come to be. And his mother, though now dead, did not escape the attacks, and many painted her as a whore who had cavorted with a demon, never mind that she had been a shy and reserved woman in life.Arrol’s father, bless his heart, had strong opinions about good and evil, and life and death. Though the village demanded it, he was not about to kill a newborn baby. He had faith in goodness, and he firmly believed that this child could be raised in a goodly household and become good in turn. The rest of the village, Arrol’s older brother included, did not share his optimism.Life was hard for the Roons after Arrol was born, and the times the family fell on were harder still. Push came to shove when Arrol’s father fell ill, and none in the village deigned to help him for fear of inadvertently helping the schemes of some evil outsider. A local healer who tended to several villages in a wide area was the only one to not let superstition or tradition hold him back in the face of genuine need.Young Arrol was struck by the doctor’s unhesitant and expert aid. By then he was already well-acquainted with death and acutely aware of his role in his mother’s. Throughout his father’s illness he had feared he would be left alone. To see the doctor push back the tide of illness moved Arrol, and from then on he stuck closely to the doctor whenever he visited. Eventually, in practice as well as fact, he became the healer’s apprentice.As the years passed by, Arrol grew into a young man. He remained at odds with the village and with his brother, but he delighted in learning the healer’s trade. Things took a turn for the worse after an altercation with a merchant in his home village. The merchant was mocking the Roons and Arrol overheard him, and publicly humiliated him. Arrol felt no remorse for his actions, but he knew it was time to move on. He drifted west into Aldira, where he sought out old centers of learning for medicine. He learned that, and much more, but he still did not belong. His appearance was still frowned upon, and frightened people, and so he headed to the true home of outcasts, where no-one was too strange to belong – Freemark. Arrol walks a fine line between optimism and pragmatism. He has seen too much yet hope is what keeps him going. While committed to healing, he knows that he is only one man with limited time and limited resources, and only heals the deserving. He is not socially adept, as being shunned his entire life has left him inexperienced in such matters. He tends to be wary of strangers, as strangers are often wary of him thanks to his appearance."5/3/2018 22:37:19,Traxian,Half-orc,Monk,"Traxian does not remember a life before the village, but locals say he wandered in one day, a shivering, malnourished half-orc childThough less than welcome, none dared to drive him offHe stayed, surviving on the kindness of strangersAll was well enough, but as the village kids began to grow older, tensions began to grow also between them and Traxian, until fights began breaking outThe villagers grew concerned – they didn’t want to send the boy off but they couldn’t have him hanging around, picking fightsTo everyone’s surprise, a local hermit volunteered to take the boy under his wing – none understood why, but it would at least solve the problem, and the matter was concludedNone knew much about the old hermit Rawen, an elderly male catfolk, but he was the only surviving member of a monk school specializing in archeryThe villagers couldn’t be blamed for not knowing this, for in truth the cat’s mind was beginning to fray, and he was forgetting much, though his body still rememberedTraxian first resisted being under Rawen’s care, as the cat seemed old and crazy for a long time before Traxian began to see the wisdom lurking beneath the dementiaOnce that happened, Rawen began to instruct him in the way of the bowWith his energies channeled towards archery rather than fighting, Traxian proved to be a quick learner and a more centered individual than anyone thought possibleTraxian himself took to the philosophy of self-improvement the monk espoused, thinking that by focusing his efforts he could be better than those mocking himTraxian stayed in the village in Rawen’s tutelage until the cat began to reach the end of his lifeIt was on his deathbed that Rawen impressed upon Traxian that he would now be the last living practicioner of their styleHe gave Traxian a locked chest, within which were the scrolls and documents detailing the style and its heritage, and Rawen took the lineage documents and wrote in that with his passing, Traxian – as his only living student – would become Grand Master by defaultHe beggen Traxian to go out into the world to first hone his own skills and then pass them on, ensuring their style would not die out with himTraxian vowed to do so with the utmost seriousnessTraxian stayed behind to give Rawen a proper burial, then set out into the world to fulfill his vow"5/3/2018 22:37:51,Natanian Surtova,Human,Fighter,"It is hard to find a truer statement than the one that children often inherit the sins of their parents. Following the Vanishing 11 years ago, there was a power struggle that was as brief as it was contentious. And when Noleski Surtova asserted his claim to the throne as the blood-descendant of Chorral the Conqueror, Natanian’s mother Inris Surtova was one of those who lost out. Inris had already grown up in the shadow of more influential siblings, and seeing this chance slip through her fingers broke her a little. Adding insult to injury, Inris’ cousin Natala, the true power behind her brother Noleski, assigned to care for a particularly distant and unimportant part of the Surtovas’ lands. Unfortunately it was the widower Inris’ sole child, Natanian, who would suffer for all that.At nine years old, most who knew him regarded Natanian as a sweet if somewhat entitled child, having been rather thoroughly spoiled by his mother ever since his father passed away several years earlier. Now, however, her treatment of him changed. Exiled and spurned, Inris cut off ties to the rest of the family and began to plot her revenge, of which her son would be the instrument. Inris became obsessed with putting her son and her branch of the family back on the throne, somehow, and this obsession came to rule young Natanian’s life from then on out. Inris saddled him with a contingent of demanding teachers and instructions, intent on preparing him body and mind to be the next ruler. Her own treatment of his became bipolar in nature: at once always dissatisfied with his progress, but also always insisting on his importance. The upshot of all this was that Natanian was saddled at once with a highly trumped-up sense of his own importance, but also a crushingly poor self-image.As he entered adulthood Natanian was forced to re-enter the world of nobility as part of Inris’ bid to put him on the throne. However, his insular and uneven upbringing had left him woefully unprepared for these complex social interactions. Thanks to both his association with his mother and his own clumsy behavior, he came to be seen as a bit of a laughingstock, and he was always painfully aware that he was being laughed at, and even more aware that he rarely got the joke.The one part of the life of nobility that Natanian found he took more naturally to was tournaments. During his tutelage, though he was by no means unintelligent, he excelled most in the physical arts, and had grown into a fit young man and a skilled warrior. With his horse Chorral, a distinctive strawberry roan, he proved quite successful, but it only did so much to help him become accepted in this world.It was at one such tourney that things went rather awry for young Natanian. It was the night before the grand melee, and he was out making a poor attempt of mingling with the other entrants. It was there that a young Lebeda noble made Natanian the target of japery, badly embarrassing him. Natanian stormed out with laughter ringing in his wake. The next day at the melee, it came to pass that Natanian and the Lebeda were the last two survivors, and they went head to head. Natanian clearly had the upper hand and was about to bring the fight to an end, but when he recognized his opponent, he instead took the opportunity to exact some revenge. He proceeded to thoroughly humiliate his foe, going far, far past the point of propriety, reducing the boy to a blubbering mess. The crowd was aghast, but Natanian was oblivious to it, feeling for the first time in his life like a true winner.Natanian had crossed a line, and there would be consequences. However, his own status as a nobility and the reputation of the Lebeda boy as a bit of an ass meant that he would have to be dealt with subtly. That opportunity arises in the plan to reclaim the Stolen Lands, and Natanian is assigned to the group heading into the Greenbelt. Since Natanian is seen above all else as a fool, he is expected to either die in the Greenbelt or come sobbing back, humiliated enough to spend the rest of his life quietly. Inris is perfectly aware of what the assignment means, and she has already written Natanian off as a failure. In fact, the only individual seemingly unaware of the ramifications of this is Natanian himself, who looks as the assignment as an opportunity to prove himself. And it may prove to be a more of a test of character than anyone suspects – for all his faults, Natanian is a young man brimming with potential, and this represents his first chance to truly be his own man… "5/3/2018 22:38:25,Desialayne Veld,Human,Brawler,"Desialayne (Layne for short) was born a bastard of a union between a mid-ranking member of the Veld family and an unknown lover of no particular breedingThe Velds hold the purity of their tighty-controlled magical bloodlines sacred, and this random coupling and its unwanted product were an embarrassmentThe child was shipped off to the mainland to an orphanage as soon as possible, perhaps sooner than was safe or wise for a newborn childAs one might expect, the stresses of the journey were too much, and the newborn baby seemed to be fading, and few expected her to surviveBut as she drifted close to death, the celestial potential within her manifested itself and kept her alive, much to the amazement of everyone presentThe child, now clearly part celestial, was to be delivered to the orphanage, but a local paladins intercepted the deliveryThey had sensed a particularly powerful celestial presence and tracked it to the childWithout much ado they took charge of the child, citing their need to recruit her as a powerful weapon in the war against evilThus, Layne came to be raised by these paladins, who trained her from birth to one day join their order as a holy warriorLayne, however, resisted and chafed at all this from the very startWhile she excelled in the arts of war, she refused to call forth the divine power that was expected of her, and hated all the religious instructionThis was a particularly strict order of paladins, and they responded to her disobedience with punishmentIt only followed that as soon as she was old enough to do so, Layne began making countless failed escape attemptsShe would escape into the nearby towns, and usually ended up in fights with the local kids, then was taken back by the paladinsShe then brought the moves she learned in streetfights to her training with them, much to their consternation, but they could hardly stop herYears passed and Layne continued to grow into a consummate fighter and an execrable paladinHer skills developed to the point where she began handily beating the other paladins-in-training, and proving a match for the full-fledged membersShe noted that her instructors were unsettled by her progressAll her life they’d told her that she was nothing without them, that they would be the ones to forge her into a weapon against the darkShe resolved to prove she didn’t need them – she could grow powerful on her ownAfter this, her already prodigious development only sped up furtherOne night, Layne, now a young woman, made one final escape attemptShe escaped the fortress-monastery, and as always the paladins quickly caught up with her in the first town down the roadThis time when they demanded she come with them, she revealed the sword she had stolen and told them to try and take herShe duelled the paladin who had trained her all her life and won, delivering the woman who had once been her instructor a potentially fatal blowThe chaos of her victory allowed Layne to escape, and she wasted no time heading for a place that would be as far away from her old life as possible, and serve to challenge and grow her further – FreemarkLayne relished her victory over her old mentor, and resolved to prove that none were her equal – that she was the greatest fighter aliveFinally free to do as she pleased, she wished to make herself a name as a peerless warrior, and to experience the thrill of victory over and over againThe greater the foe she was facing, the greater the thrillUnbeknownst to her, there are forces that still have designs on DesialayneThe paladin order hunts her, having decided that she has been corrupted, and that someone of her power cannot be allowed to fall to the dark – she must be imprisoned or destroyedThe Veld family do not yet know of her, but once they do (and once they learn of her hidden power) she will inevitably become tangled in their plansShe could be brought in just as a powerful individual (although she’d never do magic), or as a political pawn, if they think they can use herShe could be seen as a threat to be destroyed, so she isn’t used against the familyThere may be a greater destiny yet unknown awaiting her – after all, rarely are such powerful beings born on accident…"5/3/2018 22:38:57,Sogen Hudd,Human,Skald,"Sogen was born to a family of Kerthian merchants who’d settled in Freemark generations agoHis family died when he was fairly young, but thankfully he was taken in by a scholar who had known the familyHe thought Sogen was a bright young boy whose talents shouldn’t be wastedHe gave Sogen a home and a fairly thorough educationOnce Sogen was old enough, the scholar revealed that he was part of a secret organization, known as the ChroniclersThey were a group of individuals, mostly scholars, seeking to keep a record of the history of Freemark and Northreach itselfThis was a dangerous proposition, as it meant being privy to information that many would prefer was lostThus out of necessity the Chroniclers had become oral historians, passing everything down verbally rather than written down, all in secret	The scholar thought Sogen was a promising candidate for induction, and with no other course in his life, the boy agreedChronicler training proved difficult, as it required massive amounts of rote memorizationSogen came up with a solution steeped in his Kerth heritage – he learned these things by fitting them into songHe’d always loved songs and singing, a penchant he’d inherited from his parentsThe Chroniclers, an admittedly stuffy organization, were not happy about his solution, which they saw as frivolous, making light of their time-honored taskSogen was told to cease and desist and outwardly he did, although he still sang the songs in his head or on his own to help him rememberSogen advanced in the organization, learning more and more of the city’s secret historyEvery now and then he’d slip into song, and each time he was reprimanded, and each time the tensions between him and Chronicler leaders grewFinally, the tension erupted in a shout-out between him and the Head Chronicler, and Sogen was commanded to leave the Chroniclers and never returnSogen stormed out in a bitter rage and retreated to some tavern to stew in his fury, when he was approached by a stranger who offered him a good amount of money if he could put them in touch with people ‘knowledgeable about Freemark’s history’ to help with a sensitive matterDistracted, drunk and desperate, Sogen told the stranger where to go, and he was paid immediately and paid wellSogen immediately began spending the money and got fiercely drunk, got into a fight and was thrown in jail by the Brothers of the Dragon to cool his heelsWhile in jail Sogen resolved to return to the Chroniclers and beg forgivenessBut when he got out and went to see them, he discovered that the Chroniclers

22:40:21,Alasker Quint,Human,Gunslinger,"Alasker Quint was born in a small coastal fishing village, and he absolutely detested growing up there, because it was incredibly boring. All the excitement they got was a merchant caravan that periodically passed through. The caravan was exceptional because it happened to carry a moderate selection of books. And while Alasker read all the books on offer,  it was adventure novels that young Alasker was really drawn to, with their vivid stories of adventure in the world at large. Enthralled by these books as he was, he resolved to get out of his small, go-nowhere fishing hamlet. Once he became an adult he gathered (and stole) what he needed as supplies and then, after the merchant caravan had gone through once more, chased after it in the dark of night and bade it take him to the nearest city.Once in the big port city, Alasker spent his time doing anything and everything exciting. His unbridled eagerness often helped him make ends meet (and though he wouldn’t admit it, during leaner times his good reading and writing skills helped him find steady employ as a scribe). Eventually this love for the exciting drew him to the most exciting thing around: firearms. He grew fascinated with them and soon mastered the basics of their use. Around the same time Alasker realized that he could stand to make some money if he could only write adventure novels of his own, like those he had loved as a child. But when he tried, he realized that though he was good with words, he was singularly lacking in imagination when it came to crafting fiction. And this led to another realization: he didn’t have to imagine anything! If he just began adventuring himself, he could write stories about himself! And with a lifestyle like his, exciting and interesting things were bound to happen. And thus he set out as soon as possible for pirate-infested waters, where adventure on the high seas was sure to follow!Or so he would tell you, but that’s all a fucking lie. Sir Anamis Quesillin III (his real name) was born to a noble family, the good Duke Quesillin II, who was almost in direct succession to the throne. Much was expected of young Anamis even before he was born, and his molding into this role began very early on. Tutors were assigned to him from an early age to instruct him in a wide variety of topics. While he mastered the material easily, he found it uninteresting. What really captured his attention were adventure novels, offering a life outside endless courtly responsibilities. Thus Anamis grew to be the black sheep of the family – he had the capacity to lead the family into a prosperous new dawn but he just couldn’t be brought to care. He delighted in playing with firearms, an obsession of his after an inventor had brought them to court seeking to gain patronage. As he grew older Anamis persuaded his family to send him to study abroad. He insisted it was so he could bring back even greater knowledge, but in truth he wanted as far away from court as possible.Once abroad he tried to live life to the fullest. He attended his university studies in name only, preferring instead to carouse in a foreign city, where he could do as he pleased under the guise of anonymity. He would drink, read frivolous novels, play with firearms and try to write frivolous novels himself, though he found that his lack of imagination prevented him from getting far in doing so. But he was happy. This all came crashing down when he received a sudden and urgent message from home: the court had been attacked by assassins. The regent had died along with countless others, throwing the entire line of succession into chaos. Anamis realized immediately that he would not be safe for long. He gathered up all the money and important possessions he could and booked first passage out of the city, though not before bribing certain people to throw any would-be assassins off his trail.He kept taking boat after boat, now moving under a pseudonym, Alasker Quint. He shaved the long, braided hair and beard royalty customarilty kept, trimming his hair like a commoner. Eventually he ended up in distant, unlawful waters, and decided he had gone far enough. He could make a new life here. Despite the tragedy of his dead family, he relished the chance to start a new life on his own terms. He would be an adventurer, and he would write books based on his exploits. And what better place to do it!"5/3/2018 23:32:59,Kinter,Kobold,Cave Druid,"When Kinter was still an egg, his warren was raided by low-level adventures. His mother threw his egg in an underground river before she was killed, and he floated all the way to the Underdark. There, he was hatched in a clutch of Deep Dragon eggs, and the mother took a liking to him. She raised him to go and explore for her, and eventually he set out. In beautiful forests of fungus and echoing caverns, he eventually met his Dire Bat animal companion, Reeee. Reeee was so named because when Kinter found the bat, he asked its name.

After his parents died he was left a sizable inheritance and he had no one other than his childhood friend, Randal Buckman. Randal nicknamed him ‘Andor’ because Stedd couldn’t pronounce his middle name until later in life. When they became adults, Randal joined the military and Stedd wanted to follow in his footsteps to do his part to protect the innocent. Due to his poor health he was denied entry until a commander named Zasheir Rein decided to use Stedd to create the ultimate soldier. Through arcane magic and intense training, Stedd grew stronger and became known as the ‘Stormwind’ due to his battle prowess as the legion’s finest fighter. During a secret mission, Randal went missing and was presumed dead. Stedd defied orders and broke rank to avenge him by pursuing the man responsible, Grigor Dotsk. Grigor was the leader of a group known as the ‘Seven Headed Serpent’ who worshipped an ancient beast as a god. The beast was known as ‘Cull’ and would absorb people into a ‘Hive mind’ in order to use them as slaves to the Demon’s will. After a harrowing campaign, Stedd put a stop to Grigor's plans and the cult. He chose to take Grigor prisoner instead of taking his life because he knew it would never bring back his friend. Stedd was rewarded for his victory and made a Captain with a unit under his command. Captain Stedd’s crew was known as the Grand Rangers. It's brand was an image of a howling wolf and his trusted lieutenants were Dorn Dundragon, Kerri Chernin, and Morn Falone, He led his unit to many other later victories and for many years but each felt more hollow. Eventually, he left the service and his friends to explore the world and find his new path. He still wears the badge of his rank, a silver shield over his heart emblazoned with a howling wolf and a golden star with a gold chevron at the top. Buckman is still presumed dead. Stedd was Rein’s only success but many others now want to replicate his work. The Grand Rangers were disbanded and his lieutenants moved on to command their own units. Since then, he walks the world alone carrying with him the emblem of the Seven Headed Serpent on a piece of a ripped banner to remind him of his loss and the evil he hopes to have wiped from existence. Under the alias ‘Andor Stormwind’ he began to wander alone; once a soldier... now a nomad."5/4/2018 6:36:54,Wren Soundcloud,Air Genasi,Bard,5/4/2018 6:37:43,Azamia Redall,Fetchling,Summoner,5/4/2018 7:53:07,Damon Negro,Human,Rogue,"Damon Negro - The Black MerchantBorn as a slave, he was one day freed by a group of people, including a strange man with white skin, white eyes, and two-toned skin.  One of his slave holders tried to take him away as he ran from the destruction the group was wielding against the slave traders.  The man with the weird skin and eyes rushed over and killed his previous owner, but not before falling backwards through a door that led elsewhere.The young Damon would come to find out that this was the World Serpent Inn, and traveled to many lands from here, becoming an adventurer and gaining much wealth from his travels.  He ended up trading with many places, not always in items that were legal where he was trading, but that didn't bother him much.  One thing that he never stood for or allowed was trade in slaves (or murder, but he feels that they are almost one in the same), and would always do all he could to take down slave rings when he found them.As fortunate and wealthy as he had become, one day while exploring the back hallways of the World Serpent Inn he found a door that he hadn't yet explored, and nor had anybody else at the point.  Upon going through the door he found a world like many others with people and magic but with technology unlike he had seen before. So he went back to the location where he came in, and tried to get back in order to better set up shop (as it's not a good idea to go into uncharted territory with many thousands of platinum worth of goods) and couldn't get back.  Knowing this happens on occasion, he tried many different methods of opening the door.  He waited for a full moon, and a new moon.  He tried when it was rainy and when it was dry.  He learned the astronomy of the land (some of which disturbed him, as it looked like the connections to the planes were off) and tried to find all the things that could have gotten him here, that would get him back, but thus far has found nothing.  The fact that Most people believe that planar travel is impossible does not make him hopeful that he will ever get back to his multi-planar businesses, and hopes that all of his friends across the multiverse are doing well.While he (and his two traveling companions) waited to get home, they decided to set up shop and make a name for themselves here with the few goods they had.  He had come from nothing, so starting from almost nothing shouldn't be too hard. In a few short years he had a decent set of connections, both legitimate and black-market.  One of his more notable connections is with an individual known as Soliel Adrianne de Lapierre, Who was one of the first individuals he met this side of the Inn and helped him get his business running (though Soliel doesn't know this).  Damon met him in a small inn in the city of Flint, which is where he eventually set his base of operations..."5/4/2018 8:18:02,Searil Taltreader,Elf,Wizard,"Birth and Early LifeNot much is known about my early life. I might have been born in Halarahh or the North. My parents are essentially unknown to me. I have been told that my mother was a nomadic moon elf wizard that travelled to Halruaa to study her affinity for the arcane magic. She is believed dead, circumstances unknown. Nothing is known of my father. After my parents deaths, I was raised in an orphanage in the new capital, Halarahh. To hide the fact that I was a poor orphan, the earliest spells I learned were from traveling mages that focused on performing simple magic that produced sparkling lights and pleasing sounds that were often woven into my shabby fabrics to enhance their beauty. I took great pains to show off my abilities and my pretend wealth and status. ApprenticeshipMy fabric magic caught the eye of Gebel Barkal (human) one for the Council of Elders, Gebel Barkal, saw in me great potential with magic outside of my trifling fabric shows.Gabel took me to live at the High Temple of Mystra on Mount Talath in Halruaa, which was home to one of the largest collections of magic in all Faerûn. Under Gebel’s and the council’s tutelage I learned to worship Mystra (the goddess of magic) and turn my studies to the School of Divination and arcane research and study. At the temple I learned order and discipline. I learned the laws of magic need to be upheld. After 8 years under the guidance of Gabel, I was entrusted as a Lore Keeper by the Council of Elders. A Lore Keeper serves as a librarian and tour guide for the High Temple. I was tasked with organizing and keeping watch over Arcanabula books from wizards who adventured outside of Halruaa.JourneymanOver time, I learned that my faith in Mystra and my faith in magic itself is strengthened and improved through conflict and adversity. I also came to believe that my purpose in life was to collect and keep watch over magical research and regulate the advancement and dissemination of magical knowledge throughout the mortal world. I’m a professed Guardian of the Weave, and my ambition is to repair holes in the fabric of magic. I aspire to meet, and seek Quests from, “The Chosen of Mystra” - especially if it involves battling elements of the Shadow Weave. Turning PointA traveling wizard named Arhat Devekut came to study at the High Temple for one year. By day we studied the great texts together and at night he would tell incredible tales of the people and places he’d encountered (or avoided), When Arhat’s year of study was complete I decided to join him on his next adventures. I knew I needed to test and strengthen my magic, to practice my faith and, to carry out my purpose. AdventuringThe transition from academic to adventurer has been hard for me. Although I am very well-read and versed in lore, my adventuring and combat instincts are still weak and undeveloped. I’m still kind of a disaster-caster when it comes to combat.Other TraitsI am too trusting of creatures of similar faith. I can’t see why anyone would belong to any other faith other than Mystra. Those who worship Shar, goddess of shadows, and Cyric, god of lies, are my sworn enemy.I am wide-eyed, eager and entirely too trusting, especially if I think there’s some lore, history or arcana to learn. Additionally, I’m not frightened by any non-undead creature or monster as I’m always eager to learn from and usually chat with them. All of this gets me into trouble a lot. I have a blind spot for creatures with deceptive motives and I will usually mistake a combat encounter for a social encounter. I’m still shocked to learn that something wants to harm me or others.My own race (elf) and other races are of no interest to me.I know I don’t like Sorcerers and I’m suspicious of Warlocks no matter what race they are. I’m always impressed by fighters and barbarians. Their reliance on strength over intelligence to deal damage never ceases to amaze me. I really want to get into shape shifting.I have a cat named Anything.I am a horrible swimmer. I avoid the water and the cold.DowntimeIn my downtime, I still make fabric and clothing with magical flair as it keeps me focused on protecting and communing with the Weave. I sometimes sell my pieces when I need gold.SpellbookMy traveling spell book looks like a normal deck of playing cards. On the front of the card is the familiar playing card value like the Jack of Hearts. On the back of the card is an intricately woven design that only I can decipher as the text of my spell. The lettering woven into the designs on the cards is written in the Sylvan language and uses the Espruar alphabet.

As the fifth child to Valentin, and the first son, I was a welcome sight!  The fact that I was obviously different made him even more joyous.  They named me Soliel after the sun or solar, as I am radiant like the heavens.My family is originally from Danor, but moved away centuries ago because of political infighting.  We had holdings in what is now Risur, and being rather rich and powerful we kept our titles through the change in location.  We also got an upgrade as we're not silly-looking tieflings!My four older sisters instantly took a liking to me.  They, being between 2 & 9 years old when I was born had simply another playmate.  During playtime they would regularly dress me up in their dresses and, well if I had needed cosmetics I imagine they would have used it, but I'm just too pretty for cosmetics.  My father was against this, as he needed a Proper Male Heir to Take the Reins when he passed (he hasn't yet), but wasn't around enough to enforce his ruling when I was younger.  My mother on the other hand, encouraged my play.I learned all the requisite things a little Lordling should learn, such as riding, swordplay, letters, maths, history and all the rest.  Along with that, while my father was away, my mother & sisters trained me in the more effeminate side of things.  Dancing, sewing, making & leading conversation whilst seeming to be led... Really, women are truly devious creatures, but you'd have to be one to truly know the depths of their deception.During this time, I also taught myself - through trial and error mostly - how to be stealthy, pick locks, climb roofs, and generally be a nuisance.  It got me in quite a bit of trouble, which gave my mother quite a laugh and my father - when he found out about my escapades - just as angry.On more than one occasion I traveled to gatherings in other kingdoms with my sisters disguised as one of them.  Never with my father present mind you, if he ever found out... Well, we'll get to that.My parents had 3 more children, another girl, one last boy, and finally my most youngest & precious sister. (Yes, that's a total of 8 children, de Lapierre men are somewhat known for their virility. And by all accounts my father was completely faithful to my mother!!! I wonder how many children I have out there...)  My father is a good man and picked fine men for his daughters.  Like I said before, I was to be his heir, but because of reasons, he decided to name my younger brother Nathaniel heir...Those reasons are plenty.  One of the first big reasons came when I was about 16.  My elder sisters went to a gathering of a few other children of Lords and Ladies, and I decided to go with them, but as another sister.  Most of those gathering did not know me personally, and those who did knew my proclivities.  This was all well and good... Until my father decided to show up, totally unannounced at his Baron's fief.  He walked into the room, the Baron by his side talking buisness or some such, and he saw me, stopped in his tracks, turned around, and walked out.  When I saw him do this, I went and told my sisters, and was on my way out when a messenger came up to me and told me that the Marquis de Lapierre has requested an audience with me alone in one of the side rooms.  I don't think I've ever seen my father as angry as I did that night.  He said many hurtful things that evening, which I will not go over, but it is then that he announced his decision to send me to *Jierre Sciens d’Arms* ""In hopes that they will instill some manliness back into you.  Which I should have taken care and done myself a long time ago Soliel.""The academy was fun, and boring, all at the same time.  It is there that I perfected my sneaking, learned many ways I could get information and favors from people, and wrote my much-contested graduate thesis: *The Best Weapon is the One Your Enemy Never Knows Of*.  My advisor suggested other names like *The Supreme Effectiveness of Concealed Weapons* that sound less like a romance novelette, but I think it gets the point across.  Indeed I did get my point across, as one of the deans who was part of the oversight committee thought that using hidden weaponry as a primary means of attack is for uncouth brutes who lack the skill and foresight to fight properly.  When I confronted him about this, while he was on the training grounds with a drawn sword and most of the school watching, I was able to use my ""uncouth and brutish lack of skill and foresight"" to mock slit his throat with a bit of ink on a cloth.  The raucous laughter heard that day lives in my heart forever... And that was the second major reason: for attempting to kill a professor at the college.  Le sigh.  I did end up graduating, but without the honors I (and most of my professors) thought I deserved.The last straw came when we were visiting a Danorian Duke that my father was planning on doing some business with, and possibly marrying one of his daughters to one of his sons.  One of the first things the Duke showed us - and was very proud of - was an elaborate set of traps and other such devices designed to protect his valuables, including a faberge egg from some foreign land he once visited that was his pride & joy.  Three days later it was served to him on his breakfast platter.  When I attempted to tell the Duke all the ways his expensive traps fail, he exploded on me, kicked my father and I out, and was generally displeased.  The only way my father got back into his good graces was by declaring my brother heir and all but disowning me.I have not heard anything from my father since.  He has not spoken to me or written me a letter, except for one recommending me to the Royal Homeland Constabulary, with whom I now work."5/4/2018 11:08:18,Bruce,Minotaur,Barbarian,"From a young age Bruce was groomed to be an expert fighter. This is of course, no different from any other calf in his herd. He had always had a temper. He hated when people didn’t follow the rules, at least the letter of them. He didn’t much mind those in the herd who rose above from within the system. They were doing justice to the traditions his kind had set down centuries ago. Chief among the rules to be followed was, that the herd came first. This is how you survive. This is how you thrive.

She has helped him with a number of missions honing her skills as a bounty hunter.  These missions have taken them across the Sword Coast and put them in the company of nobles and criminals alike.  Her father wasn't picky about the missions they took.  They would take missions from anyone as long as the price was right.  No matter where they went, Khlyen, would know where to to go to find missions and who to talk to for information.    Dutch has mastered a multitude of martial weapons. She fights well with just about anything she can hold but almost always wields two blades.  Her favorite pair at the moment is: rapier and scimitar.  But she always has a whip at the ready to tame those unruly marks.  Because she could always be seen practicing with two weapons, the local kids started calling her Double Dutch, like the jump rope game.  This became simply ""Dutch"" as time went on.Her father was a secretive man, and there was a lot she didn't know about him.  He would regularly go off on  missions alone and not tell Dutch anything.  Before he left on one such mission, he urgently taught her a few passphrases to use when interacting with the criminal underworld.  Informing her, ""I hope you never have to use these, but just in case..."".  He left in a hurry.  He was supposed to return after a fortnight.  After six weeks of waiting for her father/mentor to return, Dutch has begun to fear the worst. Nearly of age to be on her own anyway, she has set off to track him down or find out what happened.   Knowing the trail would be cold and that her father didn't leave much of a trail anyway, Dutch wasn't sure she would ever find him.  After travelling for a few weeks she finally came across an old contact who had seem him a few weeks ago.  He said her father had mentioned  <CoS Starting town or wherever the party is> but not nothing else.  Following the only lead she was likely to get, Dutch continues on..."5/4/2018 11:13:33,Tawni Oldfur,Halfling,Druid,"Orphaned as an infant, Tawni was raised by her tribe’s elders. As ghostwise halflings, they had minor interaction with the world outside of the Chondalwood, and she knew only the willow tree that marked the center of their territory and its surrounding brush and trees. When she was four, an elven friend of the tribe, Verisanna--a druid from the Circle of the Moon--offered to take her in and train her. Verisanna gave her a surname, Oldfur, and taught her the balance of the natural world. Her nomadic tribe visited the circle once a year, checking in with her and catching up on current events from the druids, who had more involvement with the greater world.A naturally curious child, Tawni embraced her halfling heritage and druidic education but longed to know more about the rest of the world. She also yearned to know about her parents, of which neither the elders nor Verisanna ever spoke. As a young adult, she moved freely from the circle to her tribe, often time spending years with one or the other, always asking questions and hoarding information on written notes she carried with her. She wandered the wood, meeting other tribes and questioning them. Learning how their ways differed from hers and always asking probing questions about the ghostwise, hoping to find a lead to her parents.She ventured out of the Chondalwood for the first time in her thirties, after she learned of the Vistani, a mysterious nomadic group that had once wandered the Chondalwood, according to a drunk ghostwise halfling she had encountered. Transforming into a crow, she flew into the Vilhon Wilds. Each time she ventured out, she stayed away longer. Both the circle and her tribe assumed her a recluse, a hermit. She surprised them both when she compiled all of the information she’d gathered for over 45 years and confronted them about her past.The last pieces of information came from Procampur in a wizard’s tower. Waywocket Timbers once had an apprentice that convinced her Ravenloft held secrets she could add to her repertoire. She’d paid many scouts and mercenaries to retrieve texts on the subject, determined to find a way to the mysterious world. The minor obsession proved detrimental to her own work, and she abandoned it after she discharged the apprentice. Tawni travelled to Turmish and stowed away on a ship. Transforming into an owl, she easily found her way into the tower every night for a week. A very studious and observant apprentice began noticing different texts moving, so he camped out one night. When Caldwell found her, he didn’t report her but, instead, interrogated her. This was the first time Tawni met someone as curious as herself--more curious, in fact. Caldwell helped her locate the information she wanted, sometimes reading and researching well after she left.Confronted with Tawni’s research, the elders reveal the secrets they’ve kept. When the ghostwise exiled themselves to the Chondalwood, they discovered entrances to another world. Entire tribes would camp inside mist, going to sleep in the wood and waking up somewhere else. These tribes befriended the Vistani, a nomadic gypsy race that navigated the mists. Half ghostwise and half Vistani halflings stood as gatekeepers between the two worlds. 65 years ago, a Vistani visited the tribe and gave them an infant halfling girl named Tawni. The following day, all Vistani across the Chondalwood stepped into the mist and never came back. The ghostwise have no way of navigating the mists and are permanently separated from their brothers and sisters in Ravenloft.The ghostwise connection to Ravenloft is a closely guarded secret. Only a few tribes and druid communities know it ever existed. This is why Verisanna asked to teach Tawni. With balance restored to the Chondalwood after the Vistani disappeared, she hoped to deter any future disturbance by instilling the virtues of nature into Tawni. After sharing the revelation, the elders looked to Verisanna, who stepped forward and gave Tawni a gift: an 18-inch-long, 2-inch-diameter Yew dowel sharpened at one end. The yew, Tawni knew, symbolized death and rebirth. “When the time is right, you will know its purpose,” she said. Surprisingly, Tawni didn’t feel betrayed. She felt more love than she had since she was a child--that these people would work so hard to protect her. To keep her safe. To teach her about the natural balance of the world so she wouldn’t rush headfirst into a disastrous mission that could jeopardize her homeland. Agreeing to keep the secret, she still became determined to learn what happened to the Vistani. And she knew just the person that could help her. Tawni returned to Procampur a year later, her cover story ready and excited to see her friend. When she arrived, she discovered that Caldwell no longer worked with the wizard but, instead, at a local temple. He and his friend Nymeria, a blue-skinned tiefling, were researching her demonic heritage. She agreed to help, hoping to locate more information about Ravenloft in her free time. But the temple proved sparse on the subject. She began probing Caldwell and Nymeria to move on from the Vast and explore the larger world, where they could find more information on both subjects."5/4/2018 11:14:43,Caldwell A Friedricksen,human,Cleric,"A human cleric of Oghma, born and raised in the city of Procampur along the southern coast of The Vast, Caldwell’s father, Wilhelm, worked as a scribe for a wizard, and his mother, Deirdre, worked in a library downtown. He learned to read earlier than any of the other children in school. For his 5th birthday he told his parents he didn’t want any toys, he wanted a book. When he opened it up he read it from cover to cover immediately. Due to the aptitude he showed for learning, Caldwell’s parents sent him to school at the Sterling Academy in the Nobles District. Normally a boarding school for residents of the same district, there were some spots available for lower income families to send pupils there cheaper without room and board. While there, Caldwell met an older boy named Tikhomir Marsk who had a way with words, and for some reason, wanted to be pals with Caldwell. It turned out, that he was failing and in danger of being kicked out of the program. He impressed upon Caldwell the need for assistance in bringing his grades up. Caldwell offered to tutor him, but it didn’t seem to help much. Ultimately Tikhomir convinced Caldwell to cheat for him which was not something Caldwell wasn’t very proud of, but it kept his newfound friend in the school. One night Tikhomir’s family house burnt down mysteriously and he he was presumed dead. Later that year Caldwell’s mother Deirdre asked her son to see if he can find one of her pupils from the class she taught at the library. A young girl who was showing some aptitude, but suddenly stopped showing up. He looked for her everywhere he could think of, and finally found her back in the library. She was wearing a cloak that covered her appearance almost completely because she was frightened by what she was becoming. Nymeria Rex was a Tiefling who was just now at age 12 showing signs of her heritage. Small horns were sprouting from her skull and her skin was growing patches of blue scaly skin. She was scared of what people would think of her, but Caldwell was just fascinated. He comforted her and brought her to his home where she stayed for several weeks. Caldwell’s father Wilhelm offhandedly mentioned to his employer, a wizard named Ms. Waywocket “Oneshoe” Timbers, that he was boarding a young Tiefling with blue scaly skin and she jumped on the chance to adopt the young orphan. Caldwell and  Nymeria became close friends. They mostly stayed up nights talking. Caldwell found some books about Tieflings and they read them together. After school they would play in the courtyard of Ms. Timbers’ estate, as Nymeria was still quite shy of going out in public. She did enjoy showing off her new magical abilities though, and practiced them for Caldwell in the labs of her new home.After he finished school, wanting to stay close to Nymeria, Caldwell got an apprenticeship with his father’s employer. He studied hard to become a wizard, and impressed his mentor, but his heart wasn’t really in it. Also it seemed that the better he did, the worse Nymeria was treated. The wizard wasn’t outright cruel to his friend, but she was ignored or forgotten about more than was usual. Caldwell didn’t like what his achievements were doing, so after learning a few cantrips and how to summon a familiar, he decided to leave wizard training.  One night, shortly after making this decision but before executing it, Caldwell heard a scraping on the windows of one of the upstairs rooms next to where he was studying. He went over to investigate and found an owl trying to open an unlatched window. As he watched from the shadows, the owl got through the window, transformed into a halfling woman and began going through some books. Caldwell let out a small gasp as he did not expect to see the owl change forms. This startled the woman who did not expect someone to be in this room. Rather than inform his mentor about the intruder, Caldwell questioned her himself. It turns out Tawni Oldfur had heard about the wealth of information this wizard possessed and was coming in every so often to read up on some very specific subjects that interested her. Caldwell understood that motivation at it’s base level so he endeavored to assist her. She was reading about Ravenloft and the Vistani, the latter being a people who travel the planes playing music, dancing, telling fortunes and some might say meddling in the affairs of all they meet. Caldwell and Tawni read together for a few nights and then she took off. She left him with the idea that, while books are a valuable resource for information and enrichment, there is more to discover out in the real world than can be written about. He looked for other arcane places of study, but really found a place in the Temple of Oghma: The Domes of Reason. The temple’s existence was always known to Caldwell, as many of the books he grew up reading were donated to the library by the very same temple. As a cleric initiate of the church of the head of the Gods of Knowledge, Caldwell was as happy as a clam. He learned the inquisitive practice of unlocking the secrets of magic items or the effects of spells cast on a person or thing. He also learned how the correct intonation, posture and a bit of divine assistance can give power to words beyond what he thought possible.	For the next few years, Caldwell was happy spending hours getting lost in the stacks below the temple or learning from the elder priests who regarded him as somewhat of a nuisance.  The more he learned, the more he longed for the knowledge of people and places that had been lost to civilized people. He longed to travel to Raven’s Bluff and delve below ground for scraps of ancient Dwarven lore. He wanted to help Nymeria find her parents, wherever they may be. He needed to get out and see what more could be learned in “the real world”, and what could be imparted to others who might find it interesting or even useful. His dream is to one day be a great protector of one of the finest libraries in Faerun. He longs to collect the histories thought lost to the world and restore them so they can be used to teach people where they came from. During his training Diesa Torunn, a paladin of Dugmaren Brightmantle arrived on a personal crusade against those who ransacked her temple. She had been on the hunt for those responsible ever since, trying to retrace their steps using clues left by the perpetrators. She has come to Procampur as one stop along her quest of vengeance to seek information and chase down leads. Caldwell knew this was his chance to get out and see the world on an important mission opposing those who would dare ransack a holy site of a god of Scholarship. "5/4/2018 11:19:58,August Redgrave,human,fighter,"I grew up the oldest of 3 brothers. My mother died shortly after my youngest brother was born and I shared the responsibility for raising my siblings. My father was kind, but strict by necessity and taught us good manners and to respect authority. I was always the strongest of my brothers and they looked up to me. I in turn cared for them deeply.When I was old enough, my father encouraged my to join the city militia and I began earning a small wage to send home. We handled a few skirmishes with encroaching wildlife and marauding bands of kobolds. Eventually a noble came through town recruiting men to fight in a war he was waging in a neighboring territory. The pay was 5 times what I was making in the militia, so I packed up what little I had and set out to earn my keep.I fought in the infantry of what I now understand to be a tyrant's army. The training was excellent and the experience taught me a great deal about who I was and of what I was capable. My brother (the middle child) soon joined us and fought alongside me. We conquered many smaller civilized territories, and soon we inherited their problems. One such problem was an Ogre War-chief who decided a newly controlled town was ripe for the picking. His horde raised half of the buildings to the ground before running back into the mountains. Our band rallied and went hunting the Ogres.The battle was met in the mouth of a large cave. After a long and bitter fight it was clear we were not going to break through the Ogres defenses. The Captain wanted to turn back, but our Commander insisted we push on. He bellowed words of courage and glory and inspired us on to achieve feats we had only dreamed of. Ultimately we were victorious and the War-chief was routed, but at great cost. After the battle I surveyed the carnage and found my Brother had been trampled in the melee. I grieved heavily, turning inward for the remainder of my deployment. I wrote my Father and remaining Brother (the youngest) explaining what had happened. I got a letter back explaining that my Father had contracted a rather serious illness and my younger brother was training to become a Cleric in the local temple of Torm. Upon receiving this news I pleaded with my superiors to let me go be with them, but was denied.The end of my conscripted time was a bitter six months in which my training was my only solace. I threw my frustrations into my work and found a strange sense of peace in the violence. One of the officers from the elite branch of the company took notice of my increasing focus under stress. His division was less about brute force and more precision strikes, using knowledge of the anatomy of our opponents to make our attacks more effective. He saw value in me and had me moved under his command.  As far as I knew my new team was involved in more scouting and surveillance missions than straight up combat. I figured I would see how it went especially since I only had two months left on my service.I received several more letters from my Brother about our Father who's condition was worsening. My time with the company was ended and I rushed home on the first ship I could afford. It was boarded by pirates who aimed to take the passengers and crew prisoner, possibly even sell us into slavery. I couldn't tell since they were speaking another language. Sitting bound in the hull of a ship which was my only chance to get home I remembered the words of my former commander. I tested the waters with a few words of dissent and the pirates guarding us didn't seem to understand me, so I continued on calling the crew to break free and take up arms against their oppressors. Language barrier be damned, the pirates soon discovered what I was trying to do, and came over to me to shut me up. Luckily one of my fellow passengers had escaped his bonds and overpowered one of the pirates. One of the crew helped free me and we soon had control of the ship again.The pirates had altered our course enough that we added nearly a week to our journey. I arrived home hungry, tired, malnourished and too late to see my Father again. I met up with my Brother in the Temple of Torm and paid my respects. When I had regained my strength I helped my brother sell our family home. He had a place in the Temple and I didn't feel comfortable there anymore. So I set out on my own again. Determined to put my skills to good use opposing Tyranny in whatever form I found it. I felt a burning desire to make a name for myself because, life is short."5/4/2018 11:40:36,Poesy Flitterswitch Sempervirens,Gnome,Ranger,"Poesy grew up as part of a large and warm family of forest gnomes.

He floated, looking in the mirror. How handsome he was! Green eyes, long, thin eye stalks, and purple scales! Purple: what a regal color.	Then it came to him! The kobolds would do just fine for a trivial errand like this. His mind drifted: there was the master thief, but no, he had been disintegrated for suspected treachery. There was the high priest, but he was needed to maintain order. Zalshox floated through a gaping hole in the floor of his sanctum, down to the next level of his lair.

Why am I here? How the hell did that happen? Does this smell like chloroform to you?  Unfortunately for Duane, the GM who will be running Lola and her erstwhile compatriots through the Curse of the Crimson Throne, the fine line that divides truth and fiction gets a bit hazy in Korvosa.How Lola was initially sold into slavery appears to be a matter of some debate.  Respectable sources have provided several equally plausible explanations, the validity of which have been debated with academic vigor.  There is credible truth to the rumor that Lola talked her own parents into selling her for the sum of 18 coppers and a bag of tricks. It was a pretty good deal by halfling standards.  However, equally plausible is the explanation that a Chelaxian beekeeper found her stuffed in an apiary at the age of 12.  Lola may also have been part of an experimental halfling breeding program to reduce the cost of slaving expeditions. Unfortunately, the program was scrapped when it was discovered that the halfling work ethic gene was inextricably connected to an increased dependency on sardines, which anyone with half a brain knows are prohibitively expensive in Cheliax.  The breeding program was deemed financially unsustainable, and the Chelaxian state returned to the economically sound practice of kidnapping.It is likely that Lola escaped from the dreaded Chelaxian Turnip Pits through circumstances both mysterious and brilliant.  There may have been a situation involving a particularly lucky set of dice, a tribe of Mwangi cannibals, and a feat of diplomacy that ended with the slavers in a very bad position.  Unless you were a Mwangi cannibal.  In a comparatively likely account, a forged application, a misplaced mailbag and a judicious dose of whiskey produced a foreign exchange program that resulted in a Chelaxian halfling named Nigella landing in Varisia, and a somewhat disappointed Shoanti exchange student named Mofongo who later wrote a strongly worded letter about the quality of dormitories at the Chelaxian Turnip Pits.  It is also entirely possible that Lola smuggled herself out of the Turnip Pits disguised as a pack of wild dogs.  Reliable sources stipulate that three halflings dressed as a Calistrian concubine supposedly arrived in Korvosa aboard the Dread A’tuin.  Lola had the misfortune of playing the left leg.  If you were not already aware, it is extremely difficult to ride sidesaddle as three halflings wearing one yellow toga.  The logistics can be somewhat distressing. The standard explanation includes an exuberant sea captain known as Roberts.  If the stories are to be believed, Lola was swallowed whole by a whale halfway across the Arcadian Ocean.  She purportedly survived off of hard tack and the barnacles growing along the creature’s esophagus.  Only her mastery of the fabled Brown Note saved Lola from certain digestion, and placed her, somewhat odoriferously, in the Korvosan harbor. Credible accounts have also indicated that Desna herself brought Lola to Korvosa on a chariot, dropping the halfling off with three gold, 50 silver and a mandate to do something anywhere but Taldor.  Incidentally, you never want to be Nigella in Taldor.There is undeniable proof that Lola was chased by anywhere between 15 and 74 men in bath towels down Dyer’s Row.  Eyewitness accounts of the incident vary.  Apparently, this may have been due to Lola’s theft of a debutante’s virginity through unintentionally unique methods.  In fact, the young lady’s misfortune at Lola’s hands - or feet, if the rumors are correct - was due to a well-placed kick so impressively forceful that the Korvosan heiress in question suffered irreparable damage to her reputation. That is, at least, if we are to take the word of El Pompador Churrasco, philanderer extraordinaire.  Other viable explanations have implied a connection to the Laundress, a serial vandal who struck communal baths in Korvosa over a period of two and a half years.  Conservative political scholars have suggested that the Laundress may actually have been a radical member of the Elven People’s Front.  Debates are ongoing.  A third hypothesis suggests a case of unfortunate timing.  On the day in question, no less than twenty-six complaints were filed with the Brothel Owners’ Oversight Bureau citing misrepresentation of Calistrian concubines who turned out to be three male dwarves in a trenchcoat.  The bureau’s monthly meeting dissolved into riots when the coat check caught fire.“And that’s how I ended up getting chased by the guys in bath towels down Dyer’s Row.  Then I ran into you, and we ended up here.” said Lola, polishing off Diego’s third beer.  He hadn’t actually drunk any of this one.  Or the previous two.  Diego paused to wipe down the mug with a murky dishrag before asking “But who is Duane?” "5/6/2018 0:04:43,Rosa Gunning,Warforged,Artificer,5/6/2018 0:06:54,Pollen Thellorest,Earth Genasi,Bard,5/6/2018 0:44:21,Aletha Viccenta,Elf,Sorcerer,"Aletha grew up in the care of a band of traveler elves, moving from place to place in their colorful caravans, and seeing more of the world before she was fifteen years old than most people see in their lifetimes.

He was raised in The Hannigan Home for No-Good Children. Though fed and protected for, Lady Hannigan had no time for nonsense in the orphanage, with 12 hours a day of cleaning and crafting and an early bedtime. However, these long days and strict curfews did little to dissuade young Avidaniel from sneaking out. Every night, he would head to the Citizen’s Theater to listen to the tales from local storyteller, Margot Leitman. 	It was here that Avidaniel originally got the notion that he was a demi-god. The Maiden certainly sounded like she could be his mother. They share similar values and characteristics and it could explain his mysterious origins. Drawn to these stories, Avidaniel began to train under Margot every opportunity he got, learning not only how to tell a story and play a lute, but also about to get people to trust in you and believe in your story.	Before Avidan reached adulthood, Margot died of old age. Margot bequeathed Avidan a map and a note, explaining that while she didn’t believe he was a demi-god, she would not deny him an opportunity to find out who he was. The map supposedly led to the Tapestry, magical fabric that told every tale of every god. If there was to be of any evidence that he was the forgotten-son of the Maiden, it would be there. Avidan snuck out of the orphanage and left the city on a caravan. 	He quickly found out he was not suited for combat, or any real physical activity. Though tall, he was lanky and somewhat feeble. Clearly, he would need someone to adventure with him, but who would adventure with a lowly, orphaned lute-player?

That is how I wander this strange world, trying to uncover the truth about a history you primitive people never even knew existed."""5/7/2018 19:11:34,Jay,Wood elf,Rogue,Criminal5/7/2018 19:12:00,Ariana,High elf,Wizard,Acolyte5/7/2018 19:12:44,Balasar,Dragonborn,Sorcerer,Acolyte5/7/2018 19:13:08,Gimble,Gnome,Bard,Sage5/7/2018 19:13:31,Lollic,Wood elf,Wizard,Noble5/7/2018 19:33:23,Cimber Lin,Tiefling,Sorcerer,"Cimber was born into a mafia family that quickly realized they had magic powers.

At some point, she was captured by Desaix and was planned to be executed, although she was saved when Alm's army arrived. After the war, she retired from the knighthood and married Clive."5/8/2018 2:56:06,Zeke,Human,Gold Knight,"Camus is the highest example of a knight. He is unwaveringly honorable, righteous, and loyal to his nation. Even when knowing that his nation is wrong in its motivations during war, Camus always stays true to his code as a knight until the bitter end, even if it results in his own death. Such loyalty often works to his own detriment, however, as he is not necessarily happy to wage war against Zofia in Echoes, but feels too indebted to Rudolf to go against his orders. At the same time, his loyalty to Rudolf also causes some confusion and conflict as the person who bore the mark he was ordered to fight for ironically led him to fighting against Rudolf himself.Deep down, Camus is a very caring individual to those he has grown close with. This is best shown in his relationships with Nyna and Tatiana. Camus assisted Nyna in escaping the Dolhrian Empire's execution, thus betraying his country for the first time—and the only time (under his original identity). Tatiana later becomes Zeke's achilles heel as when she was captured, the threat of her own demise forced Camus to fight alongside Jerome, whom he despised for his actions. He later betrayed Jerome, and his new home country of Rigel, due to them allowing his lover to be put in harm's way."5/8/2018 3:08:34,Tatiana,Human,Saint,"Tatiana is a Rigelian saint who was orphaned at a young age. Raised in an orphanage run by the Church of Rigel, Tatiana joined the clergy in order to repay the church for raising her.Tatiana discovered the unconscious body of a man washed ashore. Having suffered grievous wounds and lost most of his memories, Tatiana nursed him back to health, and during this time, the two fell in love. The man eventually draws the attention of Emperor Rudolf who admires his combat prowess, quickly ascending the ranks of the Rigelian army and becoming close to the Emperor himself. Rudolf named the man Ezekiel, Zeke for short. However, when the war between Rigel and Zofia starts, Zeke opposes it. To make matters worse, Zeke is stationed with Jerome, a man who leads his personal platoon to constantly raid nearby villages. While Zeke cannot stand his actions, the witch Nuibaba kidnaped Tatiana and holds her hostage in her villa on Fear Mountain and threatens to sacrifice her if Zeke does not comply.'Tatiana is a good-natured, amiable, and selfless person, as shown by her caring for an absolute stranger near death and constant volunteering for duties at her monastery. However, she is also very clumsy and scatter-brained, which on more than one occasion has interfered with various tasks, such as cooking or applying a salve. She fears the possibility of Zeke regaining his memories, believing it might cause him to leave her; in Echoes, she tells Alm that she feels horrible and selfish for feeling that way, and adds that if Zeke truly wanted to return to any lover he had before, she would allow him to."5/8/2018 3:10:05,Mycen,Human,Gold Knight,"Mycen is a reputable former soldier known throughout Valentia. Originally a Rigelian early in life, he later became a high ranking Zofian general when he later moved into the southern country. In his famed military career, he became an exemplary knight whom many have admired as the finest soldier to have ever existed. In his older years, Mycen settled down in Ram Village, raising his grandson Alm.One day, the Villa of the Zofian royal family was set ablaze by Desaix in a coup of the Zofian throne. Mycen entered the burning villa and managed to rescue the young princess, Anthiese. Concerned for her half-brother, she asked if Mycen found Conrad. To her disappointment, Mycen informed her that she was the only person he could find, leaving her the sole survivor of the fire. Believed to be dead by the Zofian people, Mycen brought Anthiese to Ram Village and adopted her, renaming her Celica for her safety. For a while, he raised Alm and Celica and taught them alongside the Ram Village children, Tobin, Gray, Kliff, and Faye the art of combat. Shortly after, Desaix's crony, Slayde stumbled upon Ram Village and discovered Anthiese's survival through her brand on her hand. Though he was repelled by Mycen, Mycen was forced to send Celica away for her safety once more, bringing her to Novis Priory to further prevent anyone from ever encountering her again.During the ten years after this event, Mycen spent the years training Alm and the Ram Village children. Feeling that he was ready and properly trained, Alm asked Mycen if he could leave the village, which Mycen declined, saying that he was too green. Lukas came soon after seeking Mycen to help the Deliverance, a Zofian force dedicated with overthrowing Desaix. However, Mycen was nowhere to be found. In his stead, Alm volunteered and joined the Deliverance.A knight of great fame both in Rigel and Zofia, Mycen is a dutiful knight and often revered by the masses of both nations due to his might and chivalrous nature. He is an extremely respected individual, earning the admiration of the members of the Deliverance and the Ram Village children. Even in his much older age, his prowess in battle has never dwindled and is noted by Alm and the Ram Village children to be a particularly harsh instructor, but an effective one."5/8/2018 3:13:05,Celica,Human,Priestess,"Celica is a kind and polite person, who is often bold yet refined, but she holds herself back emotionally to an extent after a series of traumatic events and familial loss; as a result, she can come off as cold and stoic, and normally maintain a aura of polite distance, as shown her body language in cutscenes and sprites, which is subtly guarded and closed-off. She usually regrets showing her raw emotions, especially in the rare moments that she lashes out in anger, bitterness, or even sentiment. Celica feels the need that she has to set aside her emotional candor in order to fulfill her responsibilities as royalty. She is a firm believer in bringing peace without fighting, believing that fighting between one another is not the path towards peace and will always try to resolve conflicts peacefully. However, she is more than willing to put her life on the line and fight with her comrades in order to protect them. She also has been shown to be clumsy, possibly a trait rubbed off on her by Nomah, and enjoys studying and reading."5/8/2018 3:14:26,Mae,Human,Mage,"A young yet skilled mage, Mae joins Celica's group not only to watch out for her, but also to keep an eye on Boey, who has sworn to protect Celica despite the fact his skill is quite lacking compared to his eagerness. Her role is Celica's servant, however, the two are very close friends. She accompanies Celica on her journey towards the Mila Temple.An adept mage who is well aware of her talent, Mae is constantly in pursuit of self-improvement and is a prime example of a ""type A"" personality. Such traits causes an intense rivalry with Boey, whom she frequently tries to outdo at everything while teasing about his insecurities. Yet, Mae values Boey's presence and cares about him despite all of their clashing.Often seeking approval from others, Mae desires to be viewed as a highly dependable person. She is often very enthusiastic, generally speaking in an exuberant, confident, and even arrogant manner. Such demeanor manages to be contagious, as Celica states that Mae has always cheered her up when she was sad or lonely. Despite her constant cheerfulness and bombastic mannerisms, Mae is subtly self-conscious of her level of maturity, appearance and deportment wise, especially when compared to her retainer partner, Boey, and the ever reserved and mature Celica. She longs for a carefree lifestyle after the war and has a fondness of the ocean.She and Celica are extremely close to the extent that she is profusely attached to her. As a result of this, she is very concerned for Celica's emotional well-being and survival to the point of verbally rebuking enemies that threaten her safety, even if it places her life in harm's way. In addition, Mae's final battle quote reveals she doesn't care about Duma or the world ending, she simply wants Jedah to pay for hurting Celica."5/8/2018 3:15:43,Boey,Human,Mage,"Boey is the son of a fisherman and an eager apprentice Mage who is devoted to Celica's protection. He is like a younger brother to his childhood friend Mae, who constantly teases him. He joins Mae and Celica out of concern for the two of them.Boey, growing up in an impoverished household, is very insecure of himself, but because he values his impression on others, he tends to talk in formal speech mannerisms and highly of himself to overcompensate his image. However, he is more bark than bite, and is terrified easily. As a result of said cowardice, Boey does not actively enjoy engaging in battles. He speaks in a very calm, refined, yet often condescending manner, however, he has been shown to act rather moody. Due to his efforts being focused into said overcompensation of abilities in his speech mannerisms, he is not adept at confronting his own feelings while hiding behind his serious and mature front.Mae, being a close childhood friend and rival of his, recognizes these flaws and pokes at his insecurities and cowardice, often mocking him or telling him to ""grow a spine."" In turn, he often hurls minor insults at her and plays along with their bickering. At the end of the day, however, Boey appreciates Mae's company and greatly values her. In the Japanese version of Echoes, Boey's comfortableness around Mae is shown by him dropping his formal speech inflections when the two interact outside of the main story.Towards the end of the game, Boey attempts to ween himself off of his front, giving up his act of the idealization of his personality. He acts in a more jaded and earnest manner and only wishes to return home to his family after the war ends."5/8/2018 3:18:47,Genny,Human,Cleric,"Serving at the priory on Novis, Genny's mother was born there, but she hated the life on the island and departed for the royal capital for several years before returning with her as a newborn, and while her father was never known, it seems he was a nobleman with a wife and children. Afterwards, her mother left her behind at the priory and disappeared, with Genny carrying only a pendant that her mother received from her father.When Celica decides to go on a journey to discover what is going wrong with their land, Genny pledges her healing skills to Celica and her group. After the war, she fell in love with one of her allies, although she refuses to specify who.Genny is a soft-spoken and meek girl that Celica and the others consider an adorable little sister. Lacking self-confidence, as shown by her claim that she can only fix minor injuries, despite her great healing powers, she feels nervous and uncomfortable around people who remind her of her mother such as Sonya, whom she dislikes for abandoning her.In a conversation with Celica, Genny reveals her preference for an older partner, explaining that she wishes to feel taken care of. She also mentions that a relationship with someone around her age would not work for her as a result.Genny enjoys writing her own stories; one of them being about a plucky princess who eventually reunites with her long-lost father. She mentions at one point that although she was hesitant about leaving on a journey, as she is the kind of person who would rather stay at home than go on adventures, she decided to accompany her friends thinking that being left out would feel worse."5/8/2018 3:20:28,Saber,Human,Mercenary,"In the past, Saber was an ace soldier within the Rigelian army, but he fell into a trap devised by noblemen who scorned his common upbringing, and he lost one of his eyes. Betrayed by an ally who he considered a friend, he challenged them to a duel and emerged victorious. However, his opponent died and because private duels carry the death penalty in the Rigelian army, he was forced to flee to Zofia and become a mercenary.While he was drinking at a tavern around Novis Greatport, he accepts Celica's request to protect her group during their seaborne journey to Mila Temple after she offers her Golden Dagger as payment. Ever since his employment, Saber more or less acts as Celica's advisor, albeit an unconventional one. Arriving at Zofia Castle, he points out that she does not seem as impressed as Mae and Boey. After Celica accepts her heritage, Saber swears fealty to her and becomes just as loyal as Mae and Boey. When Celica announces her intention to invade Rigel to retrieve Mila, Saber assures her that he has her back. At Duma's temple, he leads Celica's army in an attempt to rescue her.After the war, Jesse asked for his co-operation after recognizing his abilities. Together, the two faced the challenges of creating a mercenary nation head on, while he marries an unknown woman.A coarse seaman with a dry sense of humor, Saber frequently debates at Celica's orders and often calls her out on her idealistic nature, aware of the necessity of violence. Despite this, Saber shows loyalty to whoever employs him and although jaded in his views in contrast to Celica, Saber pledges his loyalty to her after the reveal of her identity, showing his willingness and desire to fight for her cause.Due to his occupation as a sellsword, said honor is often cast aside, as he usually works for whoever pays him well enough, well known for having just as easily done shady services in the past with the right coin.With a reputation for drinking and chasing skirts that even Jesse claims Saber is known for being a heartbreaker, he is far more insightful than most members of her party, as he catches on the quickest that Celica is not just any priestess, and understands her intentions better than most."5/8/2018 3:21:49,Valbar,Human,Knight,"Valbar lived in a small village on the coast with his parents, his sister, his brother, and his wife and son. He became a knight in order to support his family financially. However, while he was serving his duty elsewhere, Barth's pirates attacked the village, killing his entire family. With his sworn brother Leon and Kamui the mercenary, he sought out and fought against Barth. Celica's party lands in the middle of their fight, so Valbar's party and Celica's party team up to beat Barth. When the battle ends, his group joins the party out of gratitude.After the war, he trains the young soldiers of the Kingdom of Valentia at Alm's request alongside his companion, Leon.Valbar believes in repaying his debts, and believes in living his life without regrets. He is also headstrong and always trying to help people with no regards of the consequences.Valbar is close friends with Leon, a former Zofian soldier who was able to enjoy life again thanks to Valbar. Leon has romantic feelings for Valbar, but Valbar appears to be oblivious in their supports. It is mentioned their relationship never faltered, even when Leon retired from training soldiers."5/8/2018 3:23:03,Leon,Human,Archer,"Leon was comfortably raised by both parents in a calm village. Because of his effeminate looks, he was often bullied, and became stronger through challenging such people to duels to prove himself.A former soldier, Leon reluctantly joined the Rigelian army when an unnamed man, whom Leon had long held a love for, enlisted. Said man died in battle, and Leon entered a state of depression. However, due to Valbar's encouragement and kind words, he got back on his feet and has been attached to him ever since. After Barth is defeated, he joins Celica's party.After the war, he joins the knighthood of the newly formed kingdom of Valentia, continuing to working alongside Valbar. In the remake, Leon retires to open a shop, but remains in contact with Valbar. If Valbar dies, however, he remains in the military and becomes an instructor.Leon has a pretty boy personality and sharp tongue, but he is an honest man that tells no lies. Leon has a nihilistic side, claiming he has desired to die in battle during his death quote in Gaiden.In both versions of the game, Leon has a very close relationship to Valbar, describing him as his sworn brother and saying he will go wherever Valbar goes. In the remake, it is made clear Leon's attachment to Valbar is romantic, with Leon saying that women do not interest him and Valbar is all he needs, even if Valbar never notices Leon's love for him.He also mistakenly thinks that Kamui is hitting on him in their support conversations, declining him while, at the same time, talking about Valbar being his ideal man. In his third base conversation with Celica, even she recognizes that his feelings for Valbar are romantic."5/8/2018 3:23:57,Kamui,Human,Mercenary,"A Mercenary from a distant nation hired by Valbar, Kamui used to live with his family and worked with grazing animals. However, they got into a scuffle with another tribe and lost, which led them to settle in a town.After Barth is defeated, he joins Celica's party. After the war, he joins Jesse in building their own country in the lands that once belonged to Grieth. If Jesse is dead, he founds the country in his place.He has a carefree and easy-going personality and is a freedom-loving drifter who hates being tied down. In Echoes: Shadows of Valentia, it is shown that he has a deep fear of Necrodragons. His quotes also indicate that he likes money, and works as a mercenary to get it."5/8/2018 3:25:47,Est,Human,Pegasus Knight,"Est is the youngest of the Pegasus Sisters of Macedon under Minerva's command. Unlike her elder sisters Palla and Catria, she joins late in the game, as she decided to steal Mercurius before returning. She falls in love with the knight Abel, and eventually marries him and moves to Altea.She and her sisters also appear in Fire Emblem Gaiden. According to Est, Palla, and Catria's base converstions in the remake, Est had left the Whitewings the day after the War of Shadows, wanting to open up a shop with Abel and live a normal life. Unfortunately, Est ends up getting captured by Grieth, and her sisters follow the pirate ship to rescue her, but they lose sight of it near Zofia Harbor. Jesse tries to save Est, but gets captured. After Celica's party rescues Jesse, they travel to Grieth's fort, defeat Grieth, and save Est. After the war, she returns to Archanea with her sisters, but promises to come back some day.In Mystery of the Emblem, Est is captured by the Archanean army to force Abel to fight against Marth. She can be rescued and once again fight alongside Marth's army. After the war, she leaves Abel and vanishes, leading him to disappear in search of her.As the youngest of the three Whitewing sisters from Archanea, Est is pure and innocent and often gets told off by her sisters. One such example is in her supports with Catria, as she keeps showing junk that she seems to genuinely believe is special.Though she is cheerful and chatty with a straight-forward personality, the repeated captures take a toll on Est's self-esteem. After she is rescued in Chapter 15 of New Mystery of the Emblem, her support conversations with her husband and her sisters show that she believes that she is a burden to him and doubts her worth to even be his wife. It is strongly implied that the reason she disappears after the War of Heroes is because she believes that Abel would be better off without her.Though she often gets into trouble, Est regularly mentions that she wants to stop being a warrior, settle down, and run a shop with her husband."5/8/2018 3:27:13,Catria,Human,Pegasus Knight,"Catria is a member of the Whitewings, a Macedonian squad of pegasus knights commanded by Princess Minerva. She is the second eldest of the Pegasus sisters. She is the younger sister of Palla and the older sister of Est. When Minerva's younger sister, Maria, is held in captivity to blackmail the elder princess into fighting against the Archanean League, Catria and her sisters are forced to fight too. However, as Maria is rescued by Prince Marth, they become free to join his army and fight alongside Minerva again.As the middle sister of the three Whitewings of Archanea, Catria often acts as the buffer between her two sisters and rarely pushes her own thoughts on the matter. This, according to her, is because whenever she has something to say, one of her sisters will always say it first, and assumes its common for middle children such as herself.Though she has a cool and serious personality, she's not entirely unfeeling, with her stating that people tend to assume she's completely stoic because she's more reserved than either Palla or Est.It is hinted briefly by her ending in Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon and her death quote in Fire Emblem: Mystery of the Emblem that Catria might have an unrequited crush on Marth. In Fire Emblem: New Mystery of the Emblem, her A rank support with Kris has her slowly coming to terms with her forbidden feelings towards Marth, due to having a friend to talk about them with. In Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia, multiple supports have her mentioning a crush and blushing at the suggestion."5/8/2018 3:28:37,Palla,Human,Pegasus Knight,"Palla is the eldest sister of Catria and Est, and raised them after their parents died. Loyal to Princess Minerva of Macedon, she was part of the Whitewings, an elite Pegasus squad from Macedon. The Whitewings wanted to join the Altean army alongside Minerva, but when Prince Michalis heard this, he locked his and Minerva's younger sister Maria, in jail to prevent Minerva and the sisters from turning on him. When Marth eventually rescued Maria, Palla and her sister Catria set off to look for Marth and Minerva. When they found them, they joined the Altean army. During the war, Palla developed a crush on Abel.In Fire Emblem Gaiden, Palla and Catria journeyed to Zofia in search of the kidnapped Est, eventually joining with Celica's army to help them save Est and to aid Celica on her journey.In Fire Emblem: Mystery of the Emblem, a rebellion against Minerva's rule broke out in Macedon and Palla was forced to flee, meeting up with Julian and learning that Lena and Maria were captured by Gharnef. She joined Marth's army in order to save Minerva and Maria. After the war, she pushed aside her feelings for Abel and continued serving Macedon.As the elder sister of the three Whitewings from Archanea, Palla is mild-mannered and down to earth, always caring about her sisters. However, she also has a stubborn side and absolutely will not budge after a decision is made.Palla has lingering feelings for Abel, and as such, refuses to find another lover on the request of Est with the excuse that the happiness of her sister (and to an extent, Abel) comes first, and also states in a base conversation that she refuses to admit her true feelings for this reason."5/8/2018 3:29:59,Jesse,Human,Mercenary,"A free spirit who hates the strict rules of the household where he was constantly told what to do and not do, Jesse's father was a high-ranking Zofian nobleman, and he was in fact friends with Clive and other nobles around his age. There were high expectations for him due to his skill with the sword, but trouble arose with the birth of his younger half-brother, as Jesse himself was born to a low-ranking concubine rather than a proper wife. Most of their vassals hoped Jesse would succeed his father, but Jesse decided instead to abandon his family name and run away for the sake of his sickly brother's future.At some point in time, Jesse encountered Silque being kidnapped by bandits. Realizing her plight, he rescued her and then accompanied her during her travels for a distance, parting at Zofia Harbour. Later on, Jesse attempted to save Est from Grieth, but was captured and imprisoned at the Desert Stronghold. When Celica's party frees him he then joins their team.After the war, Jesse made his own nation in Grieth's land, joined by Saber and Kamui. He became known as the ""Desert Mercenary King"".Jesse is a individual who enjoys life without restrictions, leading to his ambition of creating a kingdom that could not be tied down by anyone. Being very flirtatious and often smooth talking women in Celica's army, and even Celica herself, he is also quite a dreamer as shown in his supports with Saber."5/8/2018 3:31:31,Atlas,Human,Villager,"He is a villager from Zofia who wants to rescue his abducted siblings. After the war, he was reunited with them and returned to his village, where he resumed life as a woodcutter."5/8/2018 3:32:40,Deen,Human,Myrmidon,"Born in a provincial city in Zofia to a long line of soldiers, Deen underwent his father's rigorous training since youth, joining the Zofian Army when he came of age. Becoming engaged to a feudal lord's daughter, he was set to inherit the lord's peerage. However, while he was away for a mission, the mansion was attacked. As he rushed back upon hearing the news, he himself was attacked and lost his left eye. Reaching the mansion, he found his wife, whose form had completely changed. To kill his beloved fiancee and enact revenge on the man who took his eye, he took the lord's heirloom, the Brave Sword.Like Sonya, Deen eventually works for Grieth as a member of the Grieth Pirates, despite hating him due to his evil deeds. If Sonya is defeated by Celica, Deen will retreat into Grieth's Citadel. After Grieth's death, he will join Celica's army, noting that he knew that Grieth would have gotten what he deserved eventually. After the war, he vanishes, rumored to have gone to a continent to the south in search of new conflicts.Outright stating in his first base conversation that he doesn't do small talk, Deen only starts stating his own opinions on things after others persist on the matter. When he does so however, he is shown to have a smart and savvy side to him.Moreover, he seems to have to have similar beliefs to Duma, as he states in the final map that he while doesn't find a world ruled by might unappealing, he refuses to bow down to him."5/8/2018 3:33:44,Sonya,Human,Mage,"As a child, she lived in a monastery peacefully with her older sisters Marla and Hestia, as they were abandoned by their father Jedah at a priory when they were young. Although they found their new home constricting, the three got along well and helped each other get by. However, at some point in time, Jedah offered Sonya's sisters as live sacrifices to Duma in exchange for his trust. Escaping such fate with her sisters’ help, Sonya decided upon revenge and waited on her chance.Later on, Sonya serves as a subordinate of Grieth alongside Deen, who keeps her in check and vice versa. Although she is aware of Grieth's cruelty, and hates him, she stands in Celica’s path, preventing her from crossing the desert. If Celica defeats Deen, Sonya retreats into Grieth's Citadel. After Grieth's death, she joins Celica's army, revealing that she thought that Grieth would get his just rewards eventually. Alternatively though, if she is battled instead of Deen, Sonya will die and Deen will join Celica's party.Apparently burdened with an awful past that she hates to talk about, Sonya gives off a cool and unyielding personality and oozes womanly charm. However, internally, the feelings of hatred she hides are violent and tumultuous, and at the time when she faced off with Jedah, she fought against him as though venting her anger and fury.In Echoes, Sonya can develop a friendship with Genny where they bond over being left at a priory as children by their parents, and Sonya reminding Genny of her mother."5/8/2018 3:35:24,Conrad,Human,Paladin,"Conrad is a Zofian prince whose mother was a Rigelian noble forced to marry Lima IV in order to secure food for her homeland. Because of his Rigelian heritage, he was despised by the Zofian queen and much of his half-siblings. Conrad was very attached to Anthiese and her mother Liprica, his only two family members who treated him with kindness during their time in the royal villa. Tragedy soon struck the Villa when a great fire erupted killing many of the Zofian royal family. Mycen, a great knight, was unable to find Conrad amidst the chaos. Anthiese was presumed to be the sole survivor of the fire."5/8/2018 3:36:18,Nomah,Human,Sage,"He is the wise Sage who trained and raised Celica after Mycen sent Celica to the Priory to keep her safe.

After the war, he became the high priest of the united faith of Mila and Duma."5/8/2018 3:37:24,Emma,Human,Pegasus Knight,"Unlike Shade, Emma is fairly inexperienced and ignorant. She is a very cheerful thirteen-year-old girl, but she also seems to fluster easily. She always strives to better herself and further her training, being a fledgling sky knight, though this makes her easily influenced. Although she is a bit of an airhead, oftentimes her keen senses can suddenly rear their head."5/8/2018 3:38:08,Randal,Human,Paladin,"In contrast to the other Cipher originals, Randal has a somewhat laid back personality, wandering from town to town and battle to battle. A man who loves gambling, he is often seen with dice on the battlefield. At first glance, he seems uncaring and sloppy in appearance, yet he possesses much experience and tact–and is actually a reliable man with exceptional skills, since as a capable knight, he skillfully uses twin swords in battle. Although he hates trouble and danger, he usually ends up in the middle of it anyway."5/8/2018 3:38:56,Yuzu,Human,Priestess,"Yuzu has trained in the arts of combat from an early age and she is always keen to prove her skills against formidable opponents. And while she has a serious and unpretending personality, she can be a little socially awkward. Like many girls her age, she has a fondness of cute things."5/8/2018 3:39:44,Shade,Human,Saint,"A woman who is adept with magic and possesses great wisdom and knowledge, Shade is shown to be knowledgeable and calm (unless someone were to inadvertently poke fun at her), akin to a mature older sister, as she teaches various things to her puzzled colleagues like Emma. Although she generally behaves in a very mature fashion, she tends to react poorly to unforeseen circumstances, especially when it happens to people she knows, causing her to go into a talkative panic of frustration and concern."5/8/2018 7:09:57,Shakira Jubilee the 3rd,Human,Sorcerer,"Shakira's mother (Shakira Jubilee the 2nd) was a beautiful dancer from a long line of human entertainers. Her mom was known across the land as Shakira of the Truthful Hips back in her youth. She traveled the lands with a large traveling carnival, dancing and singing to make ends meet. One night she met a very handsome dulcimer player of draconic heritage who had joined the carnival. Even though he had some scales on parts of his body, nobody seemed to notice. And when he played the very air seemed to still and the tension could be felt as the crowd waited to burst into applause. Even Shakira was mesmerized by his prowess and she let him charm and woo her and take her to bed. They spent a glorious week together in each other's company. However, on the 8th day when Shakira the 2nd awoke, his side of the bed was cold and he was out of her life forever. The only physical reminder was the dulcimer he had left behind. It wasn't until a few weeks later when she discovered another reminder of him as she discovered she was with child. Several months later and she gave birth to Shakira Jubilee the 3rd.     Although not as beautiful as her mother, Shakira is not unattractive. However, she has patches of scales over her body as signs of her Draconian heritage. Because of this she grew up often shunned by other children who made fun of her because of her skin. Not all the carny folk shunned her though. There was a monk within the carnival that taught her how to handle a staff, a clown who taught her all the tricks one can do with makeup, and a marksman who taught her how to use a crossbow. Her mother also taught her how to dance, sing, and play several musical instruments. Shakira the 3rd found she enjoyed playing her dad's dulcimer the most. It just felt right in her hands and left her mouth free to sing. Whenever she asked her mom about her father she would just say that ""he had the most piercing green eyes, and he was very well...built"". Then her mom would smile and gaze off into the distance.     One day her mother was ill and couldn't perform. Shakira, fearing they'd be kicked out of the carnival if they couldn't add to the show decided to go onstage herself. She went onstage with her dulcimer and sang the first thing that came to her mind, ""101 Ways to Undress a Maiden"" one of her favorite bawdy songs. As she played the audience was captivated. She loved the rush of being onstage and having people laugh with her instead of at her. When she was finished she knew she had found her true calling. Once she felt better her mom let Shakira continue to perform onstage but made her sing ""proper"" songs instead of the more racy ones that Shakira preferred. She honored her mothers request because she relished any chance to be on a stage.      As she grew older her draconian ancestry emerged even more through her innate magical ability. The dancing lights spell was the first spell she learned and used it to enhance her performances. However, one day after a particularly mean joke from a goblin heckler her emotions got the better of her and she began hurling insult after insult at the man. This was a skill she was good at since she had been made fun of her entire life, even with scales she had developed a thick skin. Her words hurt his feelings and he began to cry a little bit. However, she was on a role and while insulting the man she accidentally summoned her first fire bolt. There were some minor injuries and burns but nobody was killed, however, the troupe lost a tent to the flames. Fearing her magical ability she was banished from the carnival by the end of the week.       A tearful goodbye with her mother saw Shakira leave the carnival on her own. Her mother let her keep the dulcimer left by her father and wished her well. Shakira begged her mom to come with her but she said this was the only life she has known. She had taught Shakira all she knew about entertaining and it was up to her to learn more about her magical abilities and her heritage. so she left and roamed the countryside by herself seeking small towns and taverns where she could perform in taverns and make some gold. Without her mom to stop her she became known as Naughty Shakira for her lyrics and songs were said to make even the hardest of men blush. She's been on the road for a few years seeking fortune, fame, and clues about her father. Although she has gone on a few small adventures she is known more for her skill as an entertainer than as a warrior, though perhaps that's about to change..."5/8/2018 19:13:51,Ragnar,Dwarf,Fighter,"Ragnar was a landed noble knight of the dwarven city of Baertheim. In secret he worshipped the god Kord, son of Kala, the evil goddess of the eternal winter. When this was discovered, he was stripped of his possessions, his family, his titles, even his very name, and was banished from Baertheim. But he still felt a sense of duty to his people, and set off to find someone who could help quell the war brewing between dwarf and lizardfolk. Eventually Kord cast off the yoke of his mother's evil and chose Ragnar as the Anointed One, and what was taken from him was returned."5/9/2018 3:38:42,Trivium Aravae Marduk,Half-elf,Ranger,"“Two star crossed lovers…”I think that’s how the Bards tell the tale… And it’s a similar tale that begins my life, penned long before I was born.Both my parents –my father a Human, the son of a wealthy Breland merchant and head of a guild, and my mother an Elf, the daughter of a powerful and old Elven family – were betrothed to marry others long before they were born. One to seal a lucrative business deal, the other to keep peace between two houses, but this was not to be. From first sight Urilee and Albrecht fell in love. They kept their relationship secret until I was born, during the end of the Last War. I was given the Elven name Aravae, which means great joy and happiness. When the secret was discovered, both families blamed the other for the deception, and a plan was made to kill me – the bastard child – and punish my parents for shaming them.Albrecht was slain at the hands of his own father Radbrecht, and my mother Urilee fled with me from Valenar to the forests of the northern Breland mountains, where we took refuge with a band of roving Ronin like Rangers – trackers, hunters and assassins for hire. This is where I learnt my skills, protecting the forest, moving as silent as a shadow, and killing faster and quieter than Nerull himself. I was given the name Trivium by my Ranger master, which roughly translates as the Outcast Son.My mother died of a broken heart when I was no more than 10, she never took another lover, nor looked at another man – no one could hold a candle to her long lost Albrecht. On my mother’s death bed she made me promise not to seek revenge for the ills done to our small family, as it seemed we were forgotten and had lived in apparent peace amongst the Rangers of the woods.Yet, as all sons are meant to break their mother’s hearts, I’ve journeyed as a protector with a troupe of Bards to the sea port in (Sharn) in an attempt to learn more of my hated grandfather’s guild house and Elven family, and eventually exact my revenge. I’m 25, medium height, solid but wiry frame. Green piercing eyes and a tangle of black hair is tied loosely at the nape of my neck letting my slightly embarrassingly large Elven ears poke through. I’m reserved and quiet at best, with a dark sense of humour and a love of strong ale. My temper when provoked is frightening and bestial, with the silent brute of the forest is a better descriptor for me.  When Trivium was merely 16 and still an apprentice to the Ronin Rangers we embarked on a mercenary mission to save a stupid young son of a Breland official amongst the Greywall Mountains. My brothers of the Ronin Rangers and I ventured too far over the border into Droaam and stumbled into an Ogre tribal group, which didn’t go well for our unaware band.__We suffered many casualties, the Ogres ripping the slower members limb from limb, it was a blood bath. My Ranger master screamed at me to stay back and managed to slay a number of the hairy stinking hulks before being wounded himself, his sword arm smashed to splinters by an Ogre club. Seeing my master bewildered and bloody at the foot of an Ogre barbarian I leapt upon it’s back taking its head off in one slash of my kukri before he could land a death blow. As terrified as I was of the Ogres, I dragged my heavily injured master from the fray with our remaining comrades and fled to the cover of the higher mountains.__It wasn’t until the adrenaline wore off that I noted I was missing 2 fingers from my left hand – the pinky and ring fingers – possibly bitten off by the Ogre I killed. The Breland official’s son was later found eviscerated and nailed to a tree on the western border of Breland and Droaam, we were obviously too late in finding him."5/9/2018 6:55:44,Chewi,Human,Wizard,Epique5/9/2018 10:19:37,Steven Graystone,Human,Warlock,"Steven is from a world similar to ours, which has advanced technology and no magic.

When one of the Lost Boys was dying, she expended all her pixie dust in a big wish to save him, and found herself in Faerun (which she believed to be the afterlife).

His sense of humor was always strange, to the point where he taught a kobold to speak common as a joke. His humor took a stranger, darker turn, however, when the dying started. One by one, his family died bloody, pointless deaths, and there was nothing Gildarts could do. Nothing, that is, except laugh. And so he did. He laughed when his mother died, because it was either that or collapse under the weight of his pain. He travels the world as a comedian now, his jokes carrying a strange power to them, with his favorite application being to make people or monsters kill each other. He thinks it's hilarious, and is often confused when others disagree. There's a darkness in Gildarts, and every now and then, when somebody ruins his fun or forces him to confront his pain, it emerges, and that's when he really starts to laugh."5/13/2018 21:56:39,Padraig McMillan,Werewolf,Immolator,"Padraig had a goo life. The simple life of a fisherman, but a good life. He had comfort, respect and a betrothed. But that all changed when the baron's men marched into town to collect taxes, a full six months early. This callous greed so enraged Padraig that it unleashed something buried deep within him. Fire issued forth on his breath and into his hands, where he could shape it at will. He set about dispatching the baron's men, molding the flames into weapons that he found familiar; for the main part the weapons from the barroom brawls of his youth, most notably a bar stool, with the only exception being a simple fishing spear. The deed done, he had no choice but to flee, with only a fishing lure to remind him of his old life. If he stayed, his village would be he ones to suffer. So he made his way to a new land, where he found work as an adventurer. His hatred of injustice was refined over this journey, into something similar to modern-day socialism. And then came the battle with the harpies. He fought them off as best he could, but nevertheless found himself carried off, high into the sky. A more sensible man would wait until he'd reached the harpy's nest before slaying them, but Padraig was never especially sensible. Cushioning his fall with flame, he survived, but just barely. Too badly wounded to even move, he was easy prey for the werewolf. His new for hasn't impeded his powers in the slightest, merely changed the forms that he works the flames into. Gone are the weapons of the barroom brawler, replaced instead by more primal shapes; claws, fangs and even whole wolves of fire. His temperament has been similarly altered, his cheerful, open countenance displaying some... cracks, moments of savagery and aggression beyond anything he was capable of before. One thing is certain above all, however; one of these days, he'll go home. And when he does, that baron is fucked."5/15/2018 3:43:16,Gnosi Seruna ,Wood Elf,Knowledge Cleric,"Gnosi was born into a small hamlet within South Faerun close to the sea of fallen stars. Gnosi was an outsider from birth, first with his pale ghostly skin striking a contrast with the coppery hues of his brothers, then with his love for books and wonders of the arcane. His love for studying did not go unnoticed. Through a chance encounter one night, some may call it fate, a travelling wizard named Merlin found Gnosi hiding from the other children who use to call him names. Merlin saw that Gnosi was no normal wood elf and that his ghostly pale skin was a sign from the great ashen tree who has chosen him for a higher purpose. Merlin took Gnosi under his wing and taught him what it means to be a cleric of the highest order, to follow the faith and strive to better himself. Merlin showed Gnosi that knowledge is not bad and that it can be used to better yourself. Many years had passed and a burning question had stuck with Gnosi his whole life, “Why did the ashen tree pick me?” Merlin knew the answer but did not want to tell him until he was ready to know. This was okay until one night Gnosi awoke to an empty house, Merlin was gone without a trace, no clue left behind, ever since that night Gnosi has been searching for him and has not found a trace yet."5/15/2018 5:07:23,Avon Whiterock,Human,Wizard,"After graduating from the Wizarding University of Yerby, Avon took a job teaching at a small wizarding elementary school.

Together with my shield, I wield my weapon in defenceof my duties, my fellow Kai Lords and the honour of my Order.I hope one day to follow my family’s tradition of facing down someterrible foe, defeating it in glorious combat and emblazoning myshield with its image.”"5/16/2018 6:43:02,Dawn Thunder,Human,Kai Lord,"“Most children who develop the special gifts of the Kai Lords comefrom the noble houses of Sommerlund. I am no exception, and cantrace my lineage all the way to the olden days of King Ulnar II, whenmy ancestors married into the royal line. My tutors have told me thatthe great king’s legendary intellect has surfaced in my generation,granting me a sharp mind and wisdom beyond my years. Even amongmy exceptional peers, I stand out in this regard. The Kai Skurdin have tried to keep me balanced between the physical and the mental aspects of being a Kai, but I am unquestionably better at the former. That said, I have taken quite well to weapon training with a warhammer, a weapon that my royal ancestor was also partial to carrying.Some of the Skurdin at the Kai Monastery have mentioned in passingthat I bear quite a strong resemblance to the kings of old. Some nights,I even dream of wearing a crown. It makes me wonder, just how noble is my blood?”"5/16/2018 6:44:08,Moon Blade,Human,Kai Lord,"“I am highborn and yet very different from my fellow Kai. My heritageis a mix of Sommlending and Vassagonian. I manifested Kai’s giftwhen I was only 6 years old. I am a natural psychic and while mytalents might have been put to much different ends in Vassagonia, mySommlending father proudly took me to the Monastery instead.I must walk a careful line between several worlds. I am a child oftwo nations and my mind traverses both the physical realm and thepsychic plane. I often see things that no one else can perceive andhear whispers in shadows I know are empty. My earliest memories areof speaking with the spirit of my Grandmother, a wise woman whodied ten years before I was born.My gifts make me a natural diplomat and spy, a charismatic telepathwith a knack for disguising myself as other people when the needarises.

I was foundby a Kai Lord I was attempting to pickpocket and was taken fromAnskaven and brought to the Kai Monastery for a life I never couldhave imagined.Now I ply my natural talents, both those of the Sun God and thosebest practised while He sleeps, for the good of the Order. I am a truebeliever in the ways of the Kai and no one doubts my loyalty.

Most Kai Elrhin revere Kai but I am especiallydevout. I have never missed a sunrise, always getting up before thedawn to offer Kai my morning prayer.I am not, however, a demure priestess or a cloistered Sister of the Sun.I worship as a Kai Konor should.

His career and reputation were torpedoed by his affair and subsequent marriage to one of the scorned Celden traveling folk: political dissident and budding mad scientist Leah Shaugn.The pair scratched out a living providing medical care to the forgotten dregs of Kreigerian society by day, and pushing forward their unorthodox scientific work in a hidden lab by night.  To Ludwig Krauss, these hard years were by far the best of his life.  But disaster struck when Leah's hot-headed younger brother, Michael, fell in with a faction of Celden anarchists far more violent than Leah's gentler comrades.  Doktor Krauss made a desperate last-ditch attempt to foil a bombing plot by Michael's new associates, but it ended in disaster, with dozens dead (mainly on the plotters' side), the Empire hunting suspected dissidents with redoubled fury, and Leah mortally injured in the crossfire.As Imperial forces closed in on their hidden lab, Krauss and Michael put aside their now-incandescent hatred for one another, for the one cause they still both shared: saving Leah's life.  Their shared determination, all Michael's ruthless cunning, all Krauss's surgical skill...were not enough.  Leah's heart gave out on the operating table, and her shattered body could not be revived.The temporary truce between Michael and Krauss died with her.  Ludwig Krauss barely escaped Michael's attempt to incinerate him, but as he staggered from the burning lab, he took with him his one remaining reason to live: Leah's brain, held in alchemical suspended animation by the untested techniques she and Ludwig had been working to develop.Hunted, wounded, and exhausted, Krauss knew his chances of escape were remote.  He handed Leah -- all three pounds of her, safe in her suspension canister -- to those few of her old comrades who still trusted him, and begged them to smuggle her to fellow-scientists overseas.  He would follow if he could.It has been seven years since that terrible night.  Krauss was captured, of course, after an audacious but doomed race for the border.  He narrowly escaped a death sentence for treason, and served out his sentence in a prison camp on lesser charges.  Today he walks out free, though disowned by his family, scorned by his profession, and despised by his nation.None of that concerns him.  These seven dark years, he has lived for one hope.  Somewhere, in their torn network of old comrades or scientific colleagues, someone has kept Leah safe.  He will find her, will take up their old research, will crack the alchemical secrets of life of death for her.  Any other possibility is unthinkable.If it destroys him, if history curses his name, if the Empire burns...Leah will live."5/17/2018 12:28:11,Ellyjobell Folker Ku,Gnome,Sorcerer,"The troubles in Ku's family began with her grandfather. One dark winter 97 years ago, his gnomish village was under attack from a clan of Drow seeking slaves. Ku's grandfather, Mather, snuck behind enemy lines to assassinate the powerful warlock orchestrating the drow army's tactics. When he entered the warlock's tent, he found a crystal globe with swirling darkness within on the table. Its whispers almost entranced him, but he resisted, picked up the globe, and smashed it down on the drow warlock's skull. The globe shattered, releasing the shadows within, which swirled around him and sank into his skin, turning it an ashen gray. He also gained supergnomish strength, which enabled him to fight his way out of the drowish camp. Mather made it back to his village and the gnomes defeated their enemies, but Mather was never the same. Many years later, after he and his ladyfrien had Ellyjobell's mother, Mather rose sleepwalking one night and disappeared into the woods. When his gnomish friends searched for him, they found no sign of Mather, but discovered that a once unremarkable clearing had been enshrouded in a mysterious darkness. That darkness never lifted from that day to this, and for decades the gnomes of the village avoided it.Ellyjobell's mother, Fuder, was eyed warily by the other villagers throughout her childhood. She inherited her father's ashen skin, uncanny strength, and penchant for staring, not blinking for days at a time. By the time she was a teenager, a bony hound followed her throughout the village. She made the other children nervous, and she took to playing in the woods, often romping through the shady clearing where her father had vanished, and avoiding other gnomes. Much to the other villagers' surprise, when she was 17, she became pregnant. She never revealed who (or what) the father was, and before she gave birth, she decamped from the village to a lean-to she had constructed on the edge of the shady clearing. Ellyjobell grew up accustomed to the soothing whispers that emanated from the shadows. Whenever she played there with the spectral dogs who befriended her, she felt as though she were being watched by generations of family.But tragedy once again struck Ellyjobell's small family when she was 17. A human king sent his army to wipe out the gnomish village in an effort to cleanse all non-humans from his lands. Far outnumbered, the gnomes sought out Fuder and begged her to use her dark powers to save them. Fuder demurred, confessing she didn't know anything about dark powers, and while strange things sometimes happened to her, she didn't know how to control them, but after hours of cajoling, she surrendered to the gnomes and agreed to join the battle against the humans. At first Fuder was lost in the fray, terrified of the flying slings and javelins, trying just to stay alive. But as she saw her fellow gnomes being senselessly slaughtered around her, her fear turned to rage, and a great shadow swept over the humans on the battlefield. When the darkness lifted, the human army had vanished. So had Fuder.With nothing left to keep her near the land of her birth, Ellyjobell took her favorite dog -- a black mastiff she had found among a litter abandoned in the woods and bottle-raised -- and struck out into the wider world. What powers does she have, and to what ends will she use them? Only time will tell."5/17/2018 17:16:20,Tabitha Moore,Human,Cleric,A religious medic who doesn't handle death or change well.

Without saying goodbye, she vanished into the night. She came across a group of vigilantes in a tavern who found her charm quite amusing. They adopted her into their group, known as the Courting Sails. Duffle got exactly what she wanted. For the next few years, Duffle learned the shanties of the sea and fell in love with the music. As the charming and musically gifted Duffle traveled with the group, she became their reliable distractor. Prying attention away from her crew mates as they played on with their deeds, comprised of unhinging corrupted leaders, saving damsels and uncovering drug deals. They were, of course, mostly in it for the money, but Duffle was not about to argue with that. One day, the group discovered rumors of a drug deal in a sea port they were currently in. The gnome and the Courting Sails snuck around in the cover of night to find a drop off in an abandoned part of the port, covered in broken beams and decaying wood. The dropee no where in sight. In the bag was indeed filled with drugs. Duffle proposed switching the drugs with herself. This way, the group can get the drop on the person. The group all agreed and the drugs were removed and Duffle was placed in the bag. The plan went with more or less without a hitch. The group collected their reward and Duffle was rewarded her name. A name to forget all other names. She was no longer the gnome she used to be. Only Duffle. After several more years, the group became smaller and smaller and soon there were no more Courting Sails. Duffle started singing in taverns for money. She sang her old shanties with pride. One day, she meet a Teifling bard named Meelech in a tavern called GoodBarrel. The two battled for territory fiercely, but neither of them could best the other. After some good ale, the two decided to join up. Together they became Short Verse, the traveling duo.

Inherited from his mother's side, he was the first in four generations to manifest the tiefling traits, to the dismay of his up-and-coming parents and outright derision of his grandfather, who ultimately chose his name. As he grew older however, the Blackcreek family learned to adjust to his condition, treating him the same as his brother and sister, and doing their best to find a place for their youngest in a world that looks on him with suspicion. Through his strength, dedication, and a word of recommendation from his Uncle, Faller was thrilled to acquire a steady job with the city guard, and swore to do what he could to make his family proud and his city safer. But as the years passed, his excitement at his prospects slowly faded as it became clear that he was to be shuffled to the sidelines, mostly given drunktank and archive duty while occasionally being called in to intimidate particularly uncooperative suspects. Frustrated by the disdain of his boss, his inability to prove himself, and his nonexistant prospects to advance, Faller decided to take matters into his own hands. He began to look into old unsolved cases in his free time, and then eventually into open ones as well, throwing himself into questionable and far fetched avenues of investigation that his colleagues wouldn't consider. Eventually, despite the chiding, the polite requests, and the outright threats of his superiors to keep his nose out of things, Faller began to rack up a successful case record, slowly clawing his way up the hierarchy.And it was about that point, two years ago while investigating a string of disappearances and a suspected serial killer, that a figure in armor appeared to him in a dream, and Faller had his first vision. The clues contained in the strange vision led to him solving the case, and started him down the path to becoming a holy warrior for Helm."5/21/2018 16:22:05,Pith,Elf (Drow),Warlock,Criminal5/21/2018 23:16:10,Twang,Kenku,Bard,"Twang was born a servant of the notorious trickster god, Valravn.

Hela, the goddess of the underworld found Twang's skills interesting, and took her as a servant for herself, giving her a special title: The Ravens Consort. Although Twang disagreed morally with some of the work she was given, she fell deeply in love with Hela's kindness, a trait not many saw in the goddess. Unfortunately, Twang was not always the best consort, and would sometimes enrage Hela by doing against her instructions. The final straw came when the other Kenkus, jealous of Twang's special treatment, entreated Twang to even the odds. So Twang stole the book of Language, a tome treasured by Valravn, and she gave it to the Kenkus. Hela found out and cast Twang and all the other Kenkus out, effectively making them mortals."5/22/2018 16:37:05,Kimri Godsblade,Dwarf,Paladin Ollam,"Kimri's family has a long history of service to Moradin, and she did not dare to deviate.

Maple was raised quietly, neither discouraged from adventure nor encouraged to try and fit in with the young halflings around her, which would be in vain - going by height alone, she could pass for a very short, rather stocky human. She has very curly, dark blonde hair and dresses mostly in brown, black and mustard yellow, carrying a short sword, and rarely much else. She began her adventuring career as True Neutral. Maple’s companion is a large, loyal moose named Tantalus, whom she met in the forest near her home. Tantalus has no special abilities outside of a relatively high intelligence - he is able to understand various commands and communicate with Maple through subtle non-verbal actions, such as mimicking her body language as best he can. He has a very impressive rack of antlers, which tends to get tangled in dense areas of forest. He serves as a mount and pack animal to Maple, and is, naturally, capable of doing severe damage to an assailant due to his sheer size and sharpened antlers. Despite her friendship with Tantalus and frequent forays into the nearby forests, Maple never ventured far from the Shire until the arrival of a tired party heading south on a trial mission for the White Talon Adventurers’ Guild. This party, consisting of a male human sorcerer named Hadrian, a male half-orc warrior called Zanagar, a female human bard named Desdelmone, and a young tiefling Paladin-in-training who calls herself Hero, received Maple’s hobbit hospitality with gratitude, and, spurred by her interest in the guild, invited her to accompany them on their little quest. Maple made fast friends with Hero, who really didn’t understand the difference between good and evil but who looked up to paladins and berserkers as people of courage and conviction; but the halfling’s greatest initial interest was in Hadrian, who she was hopelessly attracted to. Having always thought of herself as more or less human - the species whose houses were the same size as hers - Maple was slow to realize that Hadrian perceived her as starkly inhuman, like Hero and Zanagar - supporting characters to the (really fairly inexperienced) Hadrian and (utterly useless) Desdelmone. However, it wasn’t until the end of their mission, which Hero somehow managed to turn into a dragon-slaying quest, that Hadrian kissed Des and Maple’s heart was broken. Her party found her that night in a tavern, drunk for the first time in her life, and Hadrian began to realize rather dully that the non-human members of the party were nonetheless full-fledged people, as he comforted Maple - oblivious to the reason she was upset. Maple silently forgave him, but was prepared to return home for good until the party begged her to stay. She had shown rare bravery, not only in fighting the party’s final battle, but also in putting a merciful end to the suffering young beast the party had picked up in the jungle, when no one else could manage it. She resolved to befriend Zanagar, to counsel Hero, and to support Des and Hadrian, naive as they were, in their mission to become the greatest adventurers in all of history (not particularly likely, but a nice sentiment). This expedition was the first of many.

She remembers little of her early childhood and doesn't know what's become of her brother. She does remember that he called her Jo for her ""joker"" personality, which she suppresses in daily life. Gin's whereabouts are a frequent theme of Philomena's daydreams. Philomena was raised by Celsus, an accomplished human wizard, now a retired professor with a penchant for bucking tradition. Celsus inspired Philomena's curiosity and fondness for magic and taught her a few languages to aid in independent studies. After a rocky start, they formed a functional household with the help of Celsus' long-suffering apprentice Pascal. As a child Philomena had a harmless penchant for mischief but got caught far too many times. Other than a mild distaste for authority, she has largely grown out of it. She is keenly aware of her physical weakness and would rather negotiate or avoid confrontation altogether. Unfortunately, talking sometimes leads to more trouble; as it did during a formative encounter with an enchanter. Philomena fears being controlled and won't willingly subject another creature to it. What she reads of the monsters in the woods terrifies and at once fascinates Philomena; she needs to understand, most preferably from a distance. Since reaching adulthood Philomena has taken on not only Pascal's role as an apprentice, but those of a caretaker to her mentor. As Celsus pushes 100 years of a fulfilled life, a familiar anxiety settles in Philomena's thoughts. She sets out on quest for knowledge and discovery so that she can repay Celsus and make him proud by becoming powerful in her own right."6/5/2018 8:26:05,Alariel,Elf,Herbalist,She is searching for a potion to give eternal life to her human lover.6/5/2018 10:47:16,Lem Weirwood,Halfling,Sorcerer,"Raised by a dragon alongside an entire town of halflings - the dragon hoarded halflings.

Daggermark is relatively safe from outside predation, but the biggest threat to its people is its own citizenry—and in this aspect, it may be a perfect microcosm of the River Kingdoms as a whole.The city’s government is truly bizarre. It is a place where any citizen can hire a student of the infamous Assassin’s Guild once a year for a fair price, and only the military were exempt from assassinations. Despite this, Daggermark is relatively stable society. In a given month, five citizens of the Daggermark region die from assassination or poisoning, but murder and similar violent crimes are rare and property crimes are nearly unheard of within the city walls.It was into this strange city that, on the night of 19 Calistril, 4652 AR, Valfreya Ingenforge came into the world. Valfreya was the daughter of Torhof and Helna, a master dwarf brewer and his wife who had settled in Daggermark during the reign of its last King, Athanasius XIII. When Athanasius choked to death on his dinner, doubtlessly a product of the newly founded Poisoner’s Guild – Daggermark was rocked by chaos. Others fled the city, but Torhof refused. With typical dwarven stubbornness, he would not leave his home until he was called back to Torag’s forge. This decision proved fortunate for him and his family; when order was re-established, he was one of Daggermark’s foremost brewers. Indeed, the King’s Head Ale, one of his creations, is still a popular drink in the city.Valfreya grew up as the youngest of three siblings. Her two older brothers, Thorolf and Tarrek, were their mother’s pride and joy, but her father noticed both her inquisitive and intelligent nature from a young age. As she grew older, Torhof decided to go against tradition of only teaching the oldest son, and have both her and Thorolf learn the brewer’s art from his feet. Thorolf was never resentful toward her learning with him, as the two were very close. It also helped that Thorolf was still going to be the one to inherit the business when Torholf passed away, and so Valfreya wasn’t a threat to him. When not helping learn the honourable art of brewing or playing as young children do, Helna made sure they learned the traditions of the dwarves, including combat. In this regard, a family friend from Brunderton named Kurak Boulderhand, who had moved to Daggermark when the last Rogarvian king of Brevoy disappeared, was entrusted with teaching them. It was then that Valfreya met Kurak’s son, Orek – the one who would one day destroy everything she held dear.Orek Boulderhand was an odd dwarf from a young age. With heterochromatic eyes and an unusual gait, Orek was far more interested in books and plants than with anything stereotypically dwarven. His father was kind to him, but Orek was never his favoured son. When Valfreya and her brothers played with Kurak’s other children, Orek was always off to one side. Valfreya may have ignored Orek, but Orek certainly did not ignore her. He became obsessed with her; at first innocuously, but as they both matured, more intensely. He would leave her rambling love notes and flowers, and follow her when she was around town. Valfreya never encouraged his affections, secretly hoping he’d grow out of it.It was about this time that the Igenforge family fell on lean times. Banditry had hurt trade out of Daggermark, and new generations of brewers both human and dwarf were cutting into his sales. While he still had enough to make ends meet, it wasn’t enough to support the whole family, and so Tarrek and Valfreya were asked to seek employment. Tarrek, who had always been the most martial of the three siblings, joined the Daggermark army – a position that not only gave him a wage, but also made him immune to assassination. Valfreya, on the other hand, decided to use her intelligence and brewing skills to join the Poisoner’s Guild. Even though both she and her father disdained what the product was to be used for, both agreed that it was a good use for her talents. Her insistence on only using the best ingredients, and not polluting the creation with substitutes meant that within a few years she had become a journeyman. This not only improved her earnings, but gave her access to some of the Guild’s lesser secrets. Unfortunately, she soon found herself near Orek again, whose bookish nature and fascination with herbalism resulted in his joining the guild as well.Within a few years, Orek’s obsession with her grew to manic levels. He would take to stalking her, going through her notes without her permission, and acting alternatingly hurt and devoted when they talked. Just before she went to the Chief Poisoner with a complaint, Orek rather clumsily proposed marriage to her.This was the last straw.Valfreya launched into a blistering tirade on Orek, telling him that no power on Golarion would convince her to say yes after all the minor irritations and indignations he’d subjected her too. Orek retreated, but within a day decided that, if Valfreya wouldn’t agree, he might be able to convince her father with a large “bride-price”, which amounted to little more than a bribe. Orek was soon to be disappointed, for when he broached the subject with Torhof, the old dwarf was even more vitriolic in his rejection: “If’n my wee lass has nae interest in ye, how DARE ye insult my honour by trying to buy her! She’s nae somethin’ to be bought!” Torholf threw the bribe back into Orek’s face and told him to leave.For a few days, Orek hid in his lab. He debated suicide, or shaving his beard in lamentation so that all might know how badly he’d been treated. But the more Orek pondered, the more his demented obsession grew to anger, and hatred. He took the money Torhof had rejected, and went to a more receptive audience: the feared Assassin’s Guild. Orek bought the deaths of every family member of Valfreya’s, except for Tarrek, who was immune by law. To add insult to injury, Orek provided some of his own poisons for the deed. In the dead of night, the assassin slipped into the family home, lacing drinks and food with deadly toxins. The poison was slow, but when it hit, it hit hard: Torhof, Thorolf, and Helna died, drowning in their own fluids.Valfreya was struck with grief when she returned home to find the swollen, purplish faces of her family sprawled where they had died in agony. When she noticed a small trace of Shamweed on the bread, she quickly connected the dots. Shamweed had been a speciality of Orek’s. With an inarticulate scream with rage, she vowed revenge. She sold her half of the inheritance to Tarrek, and spent the funds equipping herself for her strike. Orek spent a month boldly demanding that she submit to him, for a dwarf woman needs a guardian, and she had none, and it was all she could do not to kill him there and then. But when she was ready, she struck. In the dead of night, as Orek worked on his toxic garden, a small spherical object was hurled through the window. Moments later, it exploded, destroying much of his garden and burning him. Worse, Orek could feel his limbs seizing up, refusing his commands to move. The bomb had been poisoned, and soon all he could do was stand helplessly and Valfreya entered, stole his works, and then, with hatred in her eyes, slit his throat. What was left of Orek’s lab burned to the ground that night, destroyed by alchemist’s fire.Valfreya had avenged her family, but now she was in a dangerous situation. It was one thing to hire an assassin to murder a rival; that was sanctioned by law. But to do the killing yourself was unacceptable. Furthermore, she had not only offended Orek’s family, but by killing a fellow guild member had brought the wrath of the Poisoner’s Guild down on her head. Staying in Daggermark was clearly no longer tenable, and so she fled, dodging the assassins sent to end her existence. She first headed north, making the dangerous trek through the spider-infested Echo Wood and into Numeria, staggering out near Castle Urion where she stayed for a month to resupply. She made a hard living supplying Pathfinders and Crusaders alike with her alchemical products. It was with the former that she met Belanes. Belanes was a Nexian Pathfinder who shared Valfreya’s passion for the alchemical. They became friends, and Belanes introduced her to the faith of Brigh, the goddess of invention. Valfreya considered joining her and her company when they left for Silver Mount, but Valfreya’s past caught up to her: The Daggermark Assassins had located her, and attempted to kill her. The battle was swift – the Knights of Urion were not having violence in their keep – but in the fighting, Belanes was killed. Horrified that she’d been the inadvertent cause of the death of someone yet again, she took ship along the Sellen and crossed into Ustalav, pausing only to have collected her belongings and the holy symbol of Brigh from Belanes’ body.The Immortal Principality proved even less welcome than Castle Urion had; after a harrowing experience dodging Pharasmian inquisitors and Count Neska’s enforcers in Barastoi, she arrived in the decaying city of Ardis. For two years she stayed, keeping a low profile selling alchemical wares to the few who could afford it, but once again her pursuers located her, and she was forced to fight for her life. She fled westward again, through Canterwall – braving the ghoul-haunted ruins of Clover’s Crossing – and into the one place where she might lose the assassins for good: the orc-ruled Hold of Belkzen. Valfreya first arrived in Freedom Town, an independent settlement of rogues and criminals, to resupply. Despite what coin she could make in the lawless place, she knew that these bastards would sell her out in an instant and so she decided to travel northwards and brave the length of Belkzen. She did not leave immediately, however; knowing she was so close to the ancient Sky Citadel of Koldukar, which had fallen to the orcs seven millennia ago after the Battle of Nine Stones was too tempting an opportunity for her to pass up. She decided she would go and view its walls, even just from a distance. Fortune smiled upon her at last, for had she not decided to risk the trip, she would have never met – and liberated – Doluel.A wiry human from Kaer Maga, when Valfreya found Doluel outside Urgir, he was in the company of several rough-looking mercenaries. Valfreya had the ill luck to be viewing Urgir’s walls right where the meeting between Doluel and his keepers and representatives of the Empty Hand orcs was to occur. Naturally, neither side was happy to have some unannounced dwarf there. Accusations and threats flew, but before either side could decide whether the dwarf was actually an outside intruder, an escaped slave, or with the mercenaries – who turned out to be Aspis Consortium hired muscle – Valfreya tossed a smokestick and a bomb into the midst, before fleeing with the help of an expeditious retreat extract. In the midst of the confusion, however, Doluel also eluded his keepers and seeing no other possible ally, ran after Valfreya.At first, Valfreya did not want company; Doluel for all she knew could be working for her pursuers, or at the very least be the kind of low-life to sell her out. Even if he was a good and honest man – unlikely in Belkzen – she did not want her past to return and hurt another. But Doluel was insistent, and showed her a letter he’d been charged with delivering to the Empty Hand. The letter had been open and resealed; Doluel had secretly read the letter’s contents during the trip. In it, the text spelt out a transaction: the Aspis Consortium would provide the Empty Hand with a weapons cache they had secreted away in return for trade rights in Urgir. As insurance, they offered Doluel as a captive until they had recovered the weapons. Doluel, understandably wanting neither to arm a powerful orc tribe nor serve as a maltreated slave, had sought an opportunity to escape, and Valfreya had inadvertently provided it. But more importantly, he wanted to ensure the weapons did not wind up in the hands of either the orcs or his former employers.The two fugitives agreed to a tentative truce, and thus began a race to the weapons cache. The trip was difficult, as the enraged orcs and the Aspis Consortium worked hard to take revenge on the pair, and only the rough nature of the landscape offered cover. Yet the land had its own dangers, as the pair dodged rockfalls and slew a hungry wyvern. During this time the two adventurers learned, slowly, to watch each other’s backs, and the seeds of a friendship were sewn. Within a week, however, they had reached their destination: the colossal monument known as the Sleeper. This ancient monument looks, from far away, like an enormous dragon wrapped several times around a mountaintop, claws dug deep into the stone. Passing into its jaws lead the pair into an enormous complex of rooms. Doluel knew that the weapons were hidden behind a secret door and knew the room to go to, but did not know where the door was. Racing through the haunted complex, the two fought strange monsters they neither of them could name, but eventually made their way to the chamber. Fortunately, being a dwarf, Valfreya’s innate knowledge of stone and earth made finding the door easy enough. It took them over an hour, however, to open the complex locking mechanism, for while Doluel had been entrusted with the letter, the key was still in Aspis Consortium hands.Inside the small, stale chamber were hundreds of finely-made weapons: spears, axes, falchions, greataxes, greatswords, longbows, and alchemical supplies. Any tribe possessing this could devastate whatever region they went. With care, Valfreya and Doluel used the alchemical weapons here along with some of Valfreya’s own supplies, to rig the room to explode when the door was opened again. As they departed to leave, however, their pursuers came upon them. A confused running battle began in the ruins of the Sleeper, with some of the orcs and Aspis Consortium intent on killing the interlopers, and others focusing on the weapons cache. The latter met their end shortly thereafter, as a massive alchemical explosion tore through weapons, flesh, and stone alike. The fighting was fierce and prolonged by Valfreya’s insistence at serving as a rear-guard to protect Doluel, but they eventually staggered out into the welcome glare of daylight.With the weapon cache taken care of – and two more powerful enemies to add to her list – Doluel and Valfreya decided to head north out of Belkzen and into the Land of the Mammoth Lords. Forsaking speed for safety, they resigned themselves to traveling primarily through the inhospitable foothills of the Kodars during the day and hiding themselves well before making camp each night. It was rough going, but they dared not brave the easier, and more densely inhabited plains. Making matter worse, as they made their way north, the dark gray thundercloud that they’d seen several days after making the Kodars finally opened up and released an unceasing deluge, an ocean of rain that washed the pebbles from beneath their feet and soaked them clear through to the bone. At first it was welcomed it, as their water supply had been in serious doubt, but as the hours turned into days of walking, eating, and sleeping in permanently wet gear, the novelty soon wore off. There was nothing for it except to turn up their hoods and trudge on, taking cold comfort in the fact that, where the orcs are concerned, only a complete fool – or, in their case, a pair of them – would be out in this weather. The raindrops filled the air so thick that anything more than a hundred feet away might as well have been invisible. As they camped, miserable, soaked, and with the thunderous pounding the rain around them, Valfreya and Doluel passed the time with half a bottle of Oldlaw whiskey, letting the warmth of the strong drink suffuse them. They began to trade tales; Doluel told Valfreya about life growing up in Kaer Maga, and how he’d fallen into debt gambling. Valfreya in turn opened up to him about her life in Daggermark, and how she’d come to be so far from home. Despite their situation, both man and dwarf laughed for the first time in many years, in the company of a friend.The rain let up as they rounded the first eastern tip of the Kodars, in the shadow of cursed Scarwall. That place was so corrupted by evil that it was palpable even hundreds of feet away, and the pair wisely gave it a wide berth. From then on, it was several weeks of hard travel north. Every day was a gamble between risking the wrath of the orc tribes on the plains, or the rarer but more dangerous monsters of the mountains. Doluel and Valfreya may have been city folk, but the journey forged them into hard customers, and they made their way through every scrap and trial unbent and unbroken. As the summer ended and fall came to Belkzen, the pair made their way to the gradual rise of Algid Wastes. Barren even by the standard of Belkzen, this perpetually snow-covered badland marked the border between Belkzen and the Land of the Mammoth Lords. Bundled with furs taken by local beasts, Valfreya and Doluel faced the cold in search of freedom. Yet what neither orcs nor rain nor any of the trial of Belkzen could do, the Algid Wastes did – separate the pair.In the midst of a tremendous blizzard that stung the face, the very snow boiled and rose to reveal rampaging remorhaz intent on making a meal out of them. A deadly battle erupted; the creature was immune to the fire of Valfreya’ bombs, forcing her to rely on less damaging acids and bottled lightning. Doluel also fought bravely, but the wind affected his aim, and any dagger striking the beast melted from its heat instantly. With the realization that the creature had them outmatched, Valfreya told Doluel to flee. Doluel hesitated, but Valfreya roared at him to escape, and so grudgingly he did. For what seemed like days, Valfreya fought a running battle, but in the end she secured a narrow cleft in a rocky outcropping that the beast could not easily enter. From there she poured bolt after poisoned bolt into the creature’s side. Eventually, the beast decided to seek easier prey, and withdrew, leaving an exhausted Valfreya to seek a fitful sleep there.As dawn and the blizzard broke, Valfreya set forth into this harsh new country with one goal in mind: find Doluel."6/6/2018 11:02:22,Melissan,Tiefling,Fighter-Rogue,"Curt of speech, ruthlessly practical, and yet strangely beautiful, Melissan is a woman who has yet to fully shed the emotional armour guarding her from harm. Despite this emotional distance, Melissan can show loyalty, even nobility, to those who earn her trust. That said, in combat, nothing is ruled out. For her, a fair fight is for fools who will be crushed by the ruthless – and she has no desire to be crushed again. With her turquoise hair, amber eyes that almost glow, two small horns and a small spade-headed tail, there can be little doubt of Melissan’s heritage, for she is a tiefling.Melissan was born in the devil-ruled nation of Cheliax on the 12th of Desnus, 4639 AR. Like most tieflings in that benighted land, Melissan was born out of wedlock: in this case, a forbidden tryst between a tiefling and Iulia Vitaron, a lesser noblewoman from Westcrown bound to House Mazinas. As befits a tiefling bastard of a noble in Cheliax, the babe was left on the doorstep of The Sanctum of Order – an orphanage run by the church of Asmodeus – with a pittance of coin to pay the priests to keep the babe. The baby, named Melissan, was raised under the strict, unfeeling tutorage of lesser clergy of the Lord of Hell, suffering bullying from both her peers, who taunted her for her otherworldly appearance, and by the priests, who would beat the children ruthlessly for any infraction, real or perceived. Nonetheless, Melissan had learned to read and write, both in her own tongue and in the tongue of hell, which she proved strangely adept at grasping. By the age of twelve Melissan, however, had fled the Sanctum rather than face another beating, and she eventually drifted into the Parego Dospera, the ruined northern section of Westcrown.Her youth passed quickly for a tiefling, and Melissan quickly turned to theft to survive. At first, she stole only food and clothes, sleeping in ruined buildings and hiding from both the Dottari – the watch of Westcrown – and the dangerous squatters and monsters that dwelled in the ruins. Her talents brought her to the attention of the Council of Thieves, who attempted to recruit her as a “puller” for their organization, tasked with acquiring things for the council. At first, the promise of steady gold and food drew young Melissan in, and as she quickly passed the Guild’s training, she felt a certain level of acceptance, though only a lowly cutpurse. However, as the years passed and Melissan reached the age of 20, she came to realize that the Council viewed her as a mere expendable asset, even as the tasks became more and more dangerous. Eventually tasked with joining in a shakedown of a group of merchants from Druma – and their mercenaries – Melissan decided that she’d had quite enough of taking hits for the corrupt plutocrats of the council. Tipping off her targets to their impending ambush, and taking their coin, Melissan robbed a small shop for supplies, before fleeing Westcrown.Naturally outraged, the Council sought revenge. Her crime of robbery was quickly discovered, and while the Dottari were unable to seek her beyond the walls of the city, the Hellknights of the Order of the Scourge were not. Captured in nearby East Rikkan, the Hellknights had Melissan flogged, and sold into slavery for her crime. Fortunately for her, the Hellknights were no friend to the Council in Westcrown, and she was shipped north along the Adivian River, to Egorian – the City of Thorns and capital of Cheliax.The trip took only a week and a half, but the cramped confines of the foul-smelling slave barge and the brutality of the slavers made it seem to last for months. The slaves were not once brought above decks, and while Melissan’s ability to see in the dark helped her – especially when her captors sought a good-looking slave to have their way with, and she needed to hide – she was unprepared for the glare of the sun when the barge finally docked in Egorian. With a heavy iron collar and manacles, Melissan and the other unfortunates were led through jeering crowds to Whipcrack district, stripped naked and paraded in front of potential buyers. Whilst most slaves hung their heads in shame, using their chains and hands to hide their nethers, Melissan stood upright, staring ahead in blank defiance. Many buyers were put off by her fiendish appearance, but many more were not willing to buy an unbroken slave. As a result she was sold directly to the city, to work as little more than a tool that can talk, cleaning sewers, fixing roads, and generally doing the unpleasant tasks assigned to her.The decades ground past painfully slowly and dully. For seven years, she worked as a city slave until she attempted to flee one too many times for her masters; from there she spent twenty-two long years being bounced from one master to another, some who used her for labour, others for magical research, and some others for their perverse pleasures, whether in the bedchamber or in a fighting pit. While some of her masters met unfortunate fates at her hands – cleverly disguised as accidents – by the time Melissan reached the age of 49, she had become a bitter, withdrawn woman, building up emotional armour around her even as her physical skin toughened under blows and beatings.Once again, she found herself in Whipcrack on the auction block, and she once again showed her customary defiance. This time the auctioneers were not in the mood to tolerate her, and were about to beat her to a bloody pulp for her insolence. Just as the cudgel was raised, a well-dressed man with a long red robe and a neatly-trimmed beard came up with his retainers. Holding out his hand imperiously to order them to stop, he gave Melissan a look up and down, and smiled cruelly. “This one I’ll take. 50 gold.” The slaver was about to start haggling, but one icy look from the man silenced him. The gold was exchanged, and like that, Melissan was someone’s property again.The man in question was Paracount Morvius Enteraii, a powerful Chelish noble and arcanist with ties to the Church of Asmodeus. As she was led by his burly guards out of Whipcrack, the Paracount suddenly turned to her, his face a mask of anger, and not the visage of the demure lord she had seen earlier. “Remember this, slave” he spat. “You are now mine; work well, and you shall do so in comfort, but fail me… know that my capacity for pain is limitless.” With a nod from Enteraii, the guards forced her to her knees and a red-hot brand with his personal emblem, a stylized E on the back of a stylized M, was placed on her back. Melissan screamed; though her otherworldly heritage gave her some protection against the fire, none of her other masters had ever branded her, and it was agonizing pain. With tears and sweat stinging her eyes, she was hauled up to her feet, and made to walk halfway across the city.Morvius was amongst the crueler masters Melissan had ever worked for; beatings were common, and the chores were laborious and difficult. Melissan’s spirit wavered in the face of the terrifying Paracount, and she became more servile to keep herself safe. As the years went on, Melissan’s intelligence and sheer endurance saw her rise in the pecking order of the slaves, eventually moving her into the Paracount’s household and, after eight years of servitude, the head of Enteraii’s household slaves, making sure tasks were organized and keeping the rest of the household slaves in line.Melissan may well have spent her life toiling under the heel of Morvius if it were not for-where she met a young Jeffrey Ebersbach, whom she befriended.-“For years Jeffrey had, with Melissan’s help, taken every opportunity to perform little acts of sabotage around the house. Sometimes he would place pieces of art on subtly precarious angles so when his robed master walked past, the air current would knock it to the ground, destroying the object; other times he’d re-arrange things to make it difficult for the pompous Entenraii to find. Unfortunately, the Paracount was arrogant, not stupid; after destroying a priceless Osirioni vase, the furious noble used his arcane powers to set up watches around his house, and quickly caught Melissan and Jeffrey laughing about their deed. The Paracount was not amused. Screaming in rage, he had both of them beaten until their backs were raw and bloody, and threw salt on them, causing Jeffrey nearly to faint in agony.“I warned you!” Morvius raged. “I warned you all those years ago. You could have lived in comfort, but *no*… so now you will know what true toil means!” After a few days recovering, Jeffrey and Melissan were sold, this time to the brutal northern slave pits, destined to spend the rest of their lives toiling in the dark and, should they not lose their lives to cave ins or poisonous gas, they might well be murdered in one of the bustling slave fighting pits set up by the owners. Clearly, the Paracount wanted Jeffrey and Melissan’s deaths to be drawn-out and painful.For the next year, the two former house slaves lived lives of suffering and toil, spending their days with picks in their hands and little more than rags for their clothes. The overseers were brutal, and some of their fellow slaves not much better. While Jeffrey grew strong and channelled his hatred into a rage which could see him through, Melissan had to be cunning to avoid be raped or killed, and she was forced to kill more than a few other slaves to defend herself. Melissan’s cunning and Jeffery’s strength brought them to the attention of Hakon.Hakon was a burly Halfling, easily Jeffrey’s match for strength, and a charismatic character as well, who had been slowly gathering a core of supporters around him. After a few tests – mainly involving acts of sabotage against minor installations and also the killing of a slave who was snitching to the guards – Hakon brought Jeffrey and Melissan into his circle. The black-bearded Halfling had been for nearly three years laying the groundwork for a massive revolt and breakout, relying on his knowledge of the mines and a stash of weapons that he had been secretly stockpiling. Jeffrey and Melissan’s talents were put to good use bringing his plan to fruition, and within a month, in the depths of the Menador winter, the slaves struck. Over thirty guards were killed and much of the infrastructure put to the torch, but the revolt was crushed when the mine Overseer unleashed a trio of ogre mercenaries into the slaves, killing Hakon and his chief bodyguard. Leaderless, the slaves panicked and attempted to flee into the hills and tunnels. The resulting massacre was frightful, but Jeffrey and Melissan managed to escape, though as they trudged through the deep snow, they got lost and separated from each other.In order to avoid detection in Molthune, she had to go upriver, around the edge of Lastwall. She was captured by Orcish raiders; apparently her filthy appearance was enough to put them off raping her, but she was beaten and sold into slavery again, this time to an half-orc who ran a really rough bar in Uglir. After several years of working as a bar slave, a bar fight breaks out and in the confusion she manages to fight her way out. Armed with little more than a table leg and clothes, she somehow survived through Belkezan, Ustalav, and finally the River Kingdoms, where she found work in some tiny backwater called Chyrrwild, working for an adventurer who was part of the little kingdom’s government. That adventurer was Ulrik van Woodstone."6/6/2018 11:42:53,Jeffrey Ebersbach,Human,Barbarian,"Jeffrey Ebersbach is far from the image most people of Avistan have when they think of a barbarian. No fur-clad savage, Jeffrey is a Chelaxian man with short black hair and piercing grey eyes, a man who might be considered handsome were it not for his twice-broken nose and the ugly brand on his left cheek. That latter injury he keeps hidden under the fearsome helm he never seems to remove in public. Jeffrey’s personality is as much a mask as his helm, for beneath his seemingly laid-back attitude and gallows humour, he hides a lifetime of wounds and a desire for vengeance. The façade only slips in combat, when he gives into his anger and becomes a rampaging, bellowing incarnation of death.Jeffrey’s memories of his home and childhood are blurry at best, but he clings to them as a drowning man would to a plank of wood. Born on the 25th of Erastus, 4688 AR, Jeffrey came into this world in a small and virtually unknown region of the Menador Mountains, the great mountain range that separates Imperial Cheliax from its northern neighbours of Nidal and Molthune. There, nestled within the rocky peaks and hills of the eastern end of the Chelish-controlled part of the range lies the Canton of Solothurn – a series of tiny hamlets united by family ties and a resistance to outside rule. Due to their remoteness, the hamlets of Stonearch, Gillian, Lorg’s Hill, and Veibourg were left largely unscathed during the years of civil war and the Thrune Ascendancy. As such, the people of Solothurn continued in their traditional worship of Erastil… and this was to prove to be their demise.In those early years, Jeffrey was the youngest of three brothers. His older brothers, fraternal twins Bern and Uri, were three years older than Jeffrey, and like him his brothers were strong, boisterous lads. When they weren’t training with spear and club to eventually become part of the canton militia, were always getting up to all sorts of larks and good-natured pranks, and having a riotous good time sneaking mead out from the cellar. His father Andretti was the village brewer, and whilst he was burly and gruff, with a stoic exterior as tough as granite – much like most men of Solothurn – beneath beat the heart of a kindly, generous man, ready to give aid and hospitality to any who asked it. For her part, Jeffrey’s mother Juliana was a hard-working and iron-willed woman who looked after her family with as much dedication as a paladin to his cause. Being the youngest of the family, Juliana doted on young Jeffrey, joking calling him “her runt of the litter”, despite being quite tall for a boy.This idyllic lifestyle came to a crashing and tragic end shortly after Jeffrey’s 10th birthday. No one knows how the Chelish Horse and Nidali slavers found the hidden Canton, but found it they did. Under the cover of a heavy autumn rain they came, when the men of the village were hard at work under the mountain, following veins of copper that was the lifeblood of the village. With lethal precision, the watch at the entrance fell to crossbow bolts tipped with a lethal poison, and by the time the alarm was raised, the slavers were already amongst the buildings. A panicked defence of the village was attempted, but there were far too few of the militia to stave them off, and the Chelish Horse did bloody work dispersing any attempt to rally. Meanwhile, women and children screamed and attempted to flee as their homes were put to the torch, but the black-cowled Nidali slavers knocked then down with cudgel blows.Juliana and young Jeffrey hid in their house, barring the door in vain hope of some refuge from the pandemonium raging outside, but it was a vain hope. After a few stout hacks from an axe, the door gave way in a shower of splinters and several of the Chelish soldiers burst in. In short order, they had knocked Julianna to the ground and had taken hold of Jeffrey, but in that moment, a howl of anger erupted outside of the house. Bern and Uri had heard the attack while they were resting outside the mine, and had sped to the village’s defence, spearing one of their family’s assailants through the chest.Moments later, as Jeffrey opened his mouth to call out to his brothers, a maille-clad fist descended into his field of view. Then, all was blackness.When Jeffrey awoke, with a great pain in his head and face sticky with his own blood, he found himself in a crowded, dimly-lit wagon, barred with heavy wood and filled with captured men, women and children, many of whom had been knocked out like him and were just coming to. Others were sobbing, or simply staring out into the inky blackness of night. Jeffrey frantically tried to find his mother, or his brothers, but in the tightly packed confines of the cart as it rolled along the mountain path he was barely able to move, and so spent the night in the corner, waiting for the dawn.When morning came, the wagon was brought to a halt, and the captives inside were marched outside. As Jeffrey’s eyes adjusted to the light, he could see a line of people chained together by iron collars, waiting with downcast eyes by a fork in the road. The black-robed Nidali were nowhere to be seen, but the footprints in the road and the number of empty collars in the chain left little doubt that they had taken their share and left. Jeffrey and the others in the cart were chained in and told to march. Any who couldn’t walk were whipped; any who couldn’t get up had their throats slit and left on the side of the road to rot.After several weeks of hard marching, in which they were given precious little food – much of which was barely edible – and often had their sleep interrupted, Jeffrey and the others were herded into the great city of Egorian – the City of Thorns. Without warning, their captor’s cruelty changed from ruthless practicality to a perverse glee, as if the red-and-black stone or the cruel rooftop spikes brought out the worst of them. “Welcome to the last stop on the line, scum!” one of them shouted. “Soon you’ll be sold to your new masters, and *we’ll* make a tidy profit of you. Now MOVE IT!”Jeffrey quickly found himself being dragged with the others down the perfectly-straight main road before being shunted off to Whipcrack – the bustling heart of the slave market, a mixture of auction stands and dwellings of the rudest kind, many of them halfling height. It was like time froze as Jeffrey’s level of fear reached borderline panic. By the time he’d regained his senses, he was on an auction block being sold like a piece of beef. The poor lad was stripped to his skivvies to show the crowd of his “fine physical potential” and soon he was purchased by a particularly harsh master – Paracount Morvius Entenraii, a self-important noble and a high-ranking member of the Church of Asmodeus.The Paracount was not a kind master. Upon purchasing Jeffrey, he had his cheek branded with his personal emblem, a stylized E on the back of a stylized M. To this day, Jeffrey has nightmares of that moment: of the pain, the smell of his flesh burning, the stinging tears rolling down his mangled cheeks before a bucket of water was thrown in face. Entenraii then took hold of the boys chin and locked him with a cruel stare. “Remember this, slave” he spat. “You are now mine; work well, and you shall do so in comfort, but fail me… know that my capacity for pain is limitless.” Without a further word, Jeffrey was clapped in manacles and hauled onto a cart by one of the Paracount’s stocky guards, and wheeled off to his estate in the district known as Hell Hound Hill. For the next six years of his life, Jeffrey was one of Entenraii’s household slaves, living a miserable existence of menial chores, meager food, and casual brutality for even the slightest mishap. Jeffrey became fairly withdrawn, his nights plagued with dreams of his family and their possible fate, but his spirit never broke to his master’s will, thanks in no small part to a tiefling slave by the name of Melissan. The head of the household slaves, Melissan was hardly the warm and fuzzy type, but her gallows humour and ready smile when the Paracount wasn’t around helped boost Jeffrey’s spirits even in his darkest moments.Jeffrey might well still be languishing as the Paracount’s household slave if it weren’t for an incident in his sixteenth year.  For years Jeffrey had, with Melissan’s help, taken every opportunity to perform little acts of sabotage around the house. Sometimes he would place pieces of art on subtly precarious angles so when his robed master walked past, the air current would knock it to the ground, destroying the object; other times he’d re-arrange things to make it difficult for the pompous Entenraii to find. Unfortunately, the Paracount was arrogant, not stupid; after destroying a priceless Osirioni vase, the furious noble used his arcane powers to set up watches around his house, and quickly caught Melissan and Jeffrey laughing about their deed. The Paracount was not amused. Screaming in rage, he had both of them beaten until their backs were raw and bloody, and threw salt on them, causing Jeffrey nearly to faint in agony.“I warned you!” Morvius raged. “I warned you all those years ago. You could have lived in comfort, but *no*… so now you will know what true toil means!” After a few days recovering, Jeffrey and Melissan were sold, this time to the brutal northern slave pits, destined to spend the rest of their lives toiling in the dark and, should they not lose their lives to cave ins or poisonous gas, they might well be murdered in one of the bustling slave fighting pits set up by the owners. Clearly, the Paracount wanted Jeffrey and Melissan’s deaths to be drawn-out and painful.For the next year, the two former house slaves lived lives of suffering and toil, spending their days with picks in their hands and little more than rags for their clothes. The overseers were brutal, and some of their fellow slaves not much better. But Jeffrey was growing to manhood, and as his strength grew, so too did his anger. He held onto the faces of the loved ones he lost, and the faces of those who had oppressed him. When forced into one of the fighting pits, he channelled that hatred into a rage and beat his opponent into a ruin. It was his strength, combined with Melissan’s cunning, which brought them to the attention of Hakon. Hakon was a burly Halfling, easily Jeffrey’s match for strength, and a charismatic character as well, who had been slowly gathering a core of supporters around him. After a few tests – mainly involving acts of sabotage against minor installations and also the killing of a slave who was snitching to the guards – Hakon brought Jeffrey and Melissan into his circle. The black-bearded Halfling had been for nearly three years laying the groundwork for a massive revolt and breakout, relying on his knowledge of the mines and a secret stash of weapons that he had been secretly stockpiling. Jeffrey and Melissan’s talents were put to good use bringing his plan to fruition, and within a month, in the depths of the Menador winter, the slaves struck. Over thirty guards were killed and much of the infrastructure put to the torch, but the revolt was crushed when the mine Overseer unleashed a trio of ogre mercenaries into the slaves, killing Hakon and his chief bodyguard. Leaderless, the slaves panicked and attempted to flee into the hills and tunnels. The resulting massacre was frightful, but Jeffrey and Melissan managed to escape, though as they trudged through the deep snow, they got lost and separated from each other. Jeffrey survived by taking shelter in a small abandoned mine; there, shivering in the gloom, he came across an ancient helm that was in surprisingly good condition. More importantly, the helm – shaped like the maw of a snarling beast – hid his slave brand entirely.During the next agonizing four weeks, Jeffrey made his way through the mountains and into neighbouring Molthune. Fortunately as one of the main fighters in the revolt, Jeffrey had gotten himself enough clothing and armour to not look like an out-of-place slave; while Molthune was not part of Cheliax, its own Imperial desires wouldn’t stop local law enforcement from simply seizing a runaway slave and putting him or her to work for their own ends. Nevertheless, Jeffrey moved as quickly and unobtrusively as possibly, stealing or fighting to survive, until he managed to stow away in a merchant vessel leaving the port of Korholm bound for Caliphas, in far-off Ustalav. From there it was easy enough to head east, into the land where no slaver could touch him: the River Kingdoms.Even in distant Cheliax, Jeffrey had heard tales of the River Kingdom of Tymon; a nation of gladiators, where all prestige and even the rulership of the land was won or lost in the gladiatorial pits. Jeffrey felt that this was a place where he could learn to fight properly and gain the skills –and coin – to try and reassemble his shattered life. Alas, Jeffrey was penniless, with little more than an ancient helm, some rent chainmail, and a pitted shortsword to his name. He was highly unlikely to be admitted into the prestigious Valknar Gladiatorial College and without an income to improve his equipment, he’d be lucky to survive a single bout in the Arena of Aroden.Fortunately the gods were smiling on young Jeffrey. After scrounging up enough coppers to get himself a cell in the local flophouse, he wandered the streets in the dying light of the day. As he rounded a bend, he heard angry shouting and cries of pain coming from an alley. A trio of rather rough looking characters were laying into a well-dressed bearded man of advancing years, angrily demanding where he had “put the money”. Drawing his battered sword, Jeffrey charged in, roaring in anger and letting that familiar surge of adrenaline speed him into battle. The three toughs turned to face him, but quickly fled in sheer terror; unbeknownst to Jeffrey, that ancient helm of his was actually a helm of fearsome mien, and his anger had awoken the helm’s power to intimidate and terrify. Having dealt with his attackers, Jeffrey helped the bruised man to his feet. Taking Jeffrey’s hand in his own in a vigourous handshake, the older Taldan gentleman introduced himself as Doctorè Alexandros Demos, one of the teachers at the Valknar College.“I am in your debt, young sirrah” Alexandros beamed. “Tell me, what brings you to Tymon?”After a long discussion over ales in the local tavern, Alexandros made Jeffrey a deal. Although he couldn’t get Jeffrey enrolled in the College – the Dean, Erevil Antelo, sneered down his nose at the underfed former slave, predicting confidently he’d not survive a week in the arena – the good Doctorè paid for Jeffrey to receive tutelage from weaponmasters and older gladiators. He learned to fight, to bear the weight of armour, and how to please the crowd. Alexandros personally taught Jeffrey the technique of the “jaguar pounce”: to seize the initiative and to inflict hideous wounds while the foe was still awe-struck. Ultimately Jeffrey’s style of combat was less about technique and more about the anger and adrenaline, leaping towards the foe and never giving them a moment to breathe or withdraw.Jeffrey spent the next seven years of his life in Tymon. After two years of training, and several bouts in the grand arena, in which Jeffrey found himself a sort of dark-horse favourite, Erevil Antelo relented, and he was inducted into the college as a full member. Although he enjoyed a friendly rivalry with his classmates, Jeffrey still kept to himself, training with every ounce of his strength to one day rescue those dear to him. He continued to fight in the arena, earning gold and prestige – by this point, he had chosen a particularly nasty falchion as his main weapon. Alas, Jeffrey left Tymon with a bad taste in his mouth. After his patron Alexandros Demos had a particularly nasty falling out with the Dean, Antelo then proceeded to humiliate and slander Demos in the public sphere, causing him to resign from the college and leave town. Jeffrey left soon after, and for the next year he wandered the River Kingdoms, offering his skills as a mercenary, fighting for Gralton and Pitax. It was during his service to the later that Jeffrey learned that not only was Melissan alive, but she had recently made her way north, into the so-called “Stolen Lands.” Apparently some upstart adventurers had started settling the Greenbelt, and Melissan had moved there. Ending his contract as quickly as he could, Jeffrey packed up his gear and followed in pursuit…"6/6/2018 13:15:18,Orlando the Dreamwalker,Earth Genasi,Wizard (Enchanter),"Descending from a long line of planetouched claiming heritage from sandman breed of elementals, this wizard seeks to master the dream-weaving ways of his ancestors."6/6/2018 13:19:07,Rorimi,Vacuum Genasi,Rogue,"The peppiest and kindest inhabitant of the quasi-elemental plane of vacuum, this genasi works her way to take care of any chore her companions have no time to handle themselves."6/6/2018 13:34:57,Khshayarsha the Clouded,Smoke Mephit,Rogue,"Messenger of Ehkahk, The Smoldering Duke of the Plane of Ash, he got stranded on the Prime Material Plane on the trip back home and is eager to use this as an opportunity to collect information, lore and rare smoking substances for the mephit king."6/6/2018 13:36:16,Khshayarsha the Clouded,Smoke Mephit,Rogue,"Messenger of Ehkahk, The Smoldering Duke of the Plane of Ash, he got stranded on the Prime Material Plane on the trip back home and is eager to use this as an opportunity to collect information, lore and rare smoking substances for the mephit king."6/6/2018 13:39:10,Genocidicles,Human,Fighter,This man knows only suffering and war. He uses the nickname instead of his true name to signify how much he lost.6/8/2018 22:11:57,Twothought,Pale One,Warden,"Twothought was spawned in the deepest caves as is the natural way of all the Pale Ones of Agartha, and, (as is the natural way) had a vigorous childhood chasing such fast-moving prey as mushrooms and snails. As a young adult, he enlisted as an engraver, and began to understand the ways of stone, but found little joy in the great honor of recording history in walls. Instead, he hid his small magical talent and enlisted as a scout to see the bright world above ground, and provide valuable intel for less ambitious failures to go and die over in the inevitable conquest of the surface. Once top-side, Twothought found that the stars and moon held a great beauty, and the wealth of plants and food were amazing compared to the stone of his home – and indeed, though stone could be found in only one direction, it still remained comfortingly present in many places.And so Twothought wandered around aimlessly looking at stuff, until one day he saw a delicious roast of cooked meat, in a camp of humans. Trusting in his great stealth and the inability of humans to see in the dark, he crept in to seize it, and as soon as he did, could not resist the temptation of the wonderful aroma that arose from it, unlike any type of meat he had then eaten. He knew he needed to flee, but couldn't resist tasting it, and after one taste, couldn't resist another. How many minutes he spent eating he does not recall, but it was too many, for some human spotted him and gave the alarm, and suddenly he was surrounded by steel.Thereafter he was taken prisoner, and as a great curiosity to the people of Ermor, those who had conquered him, he was soon auctioned off as a slave for a substantial price to a young senator. In the senator's service, he was used as a conversation piece, and was taught Ermorian. It was here that he began to associate with Ulmish and Vanir slaves, and met the necromancer Behesh. When Eldregate fell, Twothought bore witness to it, and as his master succumbed, he fled with the rest of the senatorial retinue to Arrentium.There, he fell de facto under the control of the Ermorian Sergeant Egalitus, who was a mere gate guard before the city fell but rose to greater stature thereafter. This unit was tasked with exterminating the halfmen raiders who were opportunistically harassing supply lines as the legions fought the tide of dead now pouring from Ermor's capitol, and particularly that band led by the unholy necromancer of Asphodel called Nyxmantis. In these campaigns, Twothought killed many satyrs, razed a halfman fortress (from which the captives unfortunately could not be rescued) and even slew a minotaur, whose skull became Twothought's helmet. During this period, Twothought studied the natural world and its magics, which the halfmen used to great effect, and by synthesizing them with the magic he had learned in Agartha, Twothought grew more magically powerful. Finally, Nyxmantis was cornered and slain, and while his final spell was successful and unleashed a terrible ambulatory cathedral upon the world, that was someone else's problem. Twothought used his hide to create armor, and returned to Arrentium.Arrentium was in a poor condition which worsened as the realm of the dead had spread. Even before the campaign against Nyxmantis had begun in full, the Augur's tower had come under attack, and the most senior Augur, who after death became known as Saoluthi, lost his mortal form and utilized the power of death as a Dusk Elder. The streets and many buildings were overrun with strange horrors and tragedies, and Twothought's fallen comrade, a Vanir of some renown, still walks the streets as a mindless corpse. But the misery of Arrentium reached its zenith when the Colosseum from which Twothought was awarded his mount – a mighty cave drake – connected directly to the realm of the dead. Most citizens went in and never came out, for when a tide of ghosts began to flood out, the mages Saoluthi and Behesh were able to shut it, with no help from the military at large, who foolishly tried to harness this power. After striking down these evil mages, Twothought had his first direct confrontation with law enforcement, alongside the fish man Lagash, but while Lagash perished in the confrontation, Twothought was able to escape as he had become incomparably resilient, combining natural Pale One toughness with earth magic and armor.After this confrontation in Arrentium, Egalitus and his unit were given a task involving egress from the city, perhaps because of conflict with the military mages. They were to escort the Pythian equite to Pythium together with a message concerning the succession of the Ermor. On this journey, Twothought fought bandits, halfmen, and the undead on the road, killing them all, and was also involved in good-natured altercations with local drunks and authorities in towns along the way. Twice he was imprisoned, but once escaped thanks to the intervention of Egalitus, and once thanks to an unknowable horror from beyond reality, which was summoned by the now utterly insane mage Saoluthi. Along the way, Twothought synergized his formation-oriented spear training gained in Agartha with the more individual-oriented tactics used by Ulmites, (which were in some ways more suitable to the sorts of battles often found in Twothought's adventures) but adapted to use the large shields and short swords of Ermorian manufacture."6/9/2018 16:41:54,Zova,Human,Envoy,"Zova's parents saw it coming, of course, well before she made clear her intention to travel the world and seek its wonders.

Much of the influence of House Holdare comes from their renown for producing skilled adata—scholar-priests who oversee the removal and preservation of thin slices of the brains of deceased kasatha in technomagical temples called adats.

Her father had visions of a queenly young woman sitting in silk among the station's most prominent socialites."6/9/2018 17:03:58,Obozaya,Vesk,Soldier,"In classic vesk fashion, Obozaya Ymeros lets her friends shorten her name to ""Obo,"" but not even Damoritosh himself can protect those who attempt to use her nickname without earning it first.Obozaya was born on Vesk Prime, the planetary capital of the Veskarium, to a family of low-level military bureaucrats. Distinguishing herself with her determination and ferocity on the sports field and in the dueling ring—if not in her academic studies—Obozaya quickly established herself as a top-notch military cadet, enlisting as soon as her basic studies were complete.Obozaya took to military life like a swamp lion to water, and soon outpaced many in her cohort. In Veskarium society, social status is most easily earned through excellence in combat, and Obo had no desire to spend her entire life at the same forgettable rank as her parents. Though her dreams of glory were hardly unique, she nevertheless proved herself in several early battles, putting down a vicious rebellion among the feline barbarians of Vesk-6.Yet in her youthful arrogance, Obozaya overlooked the power of political connection. After dueling and deeply shaming another member of her unit—one with family ties to high-ranking military officials—she found herself promoted and assigned to patrol a section of frozen tundra on Vesk-8, where the staunchly pacifist residents refused to give her any opportunity for righteous combat. It soon became clear that neither appeals to her superiors nor prayers to Damoritosh the Conqueror were going to get her a better assignment. Thus, as her first term of enlistment drew to a close, a frustrated Obozaya took the Soldier's Due, the time-honored vesk tradition of being honorably discharged and taking your government-issue armor and weapons with you.Still in love with the idea of one day becoming a major player in vesk society, and disgusted by the idea that politics could exist within the Veskarium's vaunted military meritocracy, Obozaya followed in the footsteps of many other legendary vesk warriors and left home to work as a mercenary in the Pact Worlds. Here, at last, she found what she'd been searching for: an endless series of battles and adventures, with no restrictions but her own sense of honor. Rather than signing on with an established mercenary company, Obozaya found herself better suited to working with small groups of explorers and adventurers. Small teams mean more glory per person when you succeed, and she often finds herself the sole front-line fighter on a crew, which appeals to both her vanity and her showboating style. As she's fond of saying, battle is too important to leave to amateurs, and Obozaya believes that the best way to win a fight is to move fast and hit hard. Though she's drifted away from Damoritosh's faith in recent years, coming to appreciate some other races' criticisms of the Conqueror, she still adores using his sacred doshko for her close-up fighting.Personality-wise, Obozaya is a study in contrasts. While she appreciates material wealth and creature comforts, her true desire is for recognition. This is perhaps best exemplified by the holoprojector on her back, which usually projects a modified version of Damoritosh's symbol to advertise her as a warrior for hire, but which is capable of projecting a personalized holographic war-banner in combat to make sure the enemy knows exactly who's coming for them. Brilliant on the battlefield, Obozaya nevertheless finds herself a little slow on the draw in most intellectual pursuits, having little patience for any education not directly related to her vocation. She believes that honor demands honesty, and while she's not against lying by omission, she would rather die than break her word or renege on a contract. In conversations with new people, she's either unnervingly stoic or direct to the point of rudeness, and thinks that most species talk more than they need to as an attempt to cover up their cowardice.All of which makes it that much more surprising to discover how much her companions adore her. Sure, Obo may explain her loyalty as a mercenary's pragmatism, yet everyone in her crew knows they can count on ""the big lizard"" to pull them out of a scrape, no matter the cost. As with many vesk, her gruff manner is punctuated with sudden outpourings of emotion, and with her characteristic directness, Obo finds no fear or shame in telling her friends how much she loves them. Much of her life is spent on or training for missions, yet when Obozaya sets out to celebrate a success, it's with her trademark bombastic zeal. Eschewing the berserker drugs favored by some of her kindred, she's nevertheless fond of the Veskarium nose-hookahs sometimes called ""dragon's breath,"" as well as the mildly hallucinogenic brain snails of Vesk-2 and other traditional vesk snacks. More than one bar has been sacrificed to (and well compensated for) her parties, and the heavy bass of her beloved revelaz dance-pop beats is notorious for bursting rivets on ship bulkheads."6/9/2018 17:06:17,Raia,Lashunta,Technomancer,"Raia Danviri was born and raised in the lashunta city-state of Komena, near the southern tip of the continent of Asana on Castrovel. Komena's proximity to the formian-inhabited continent of the Colonies has made it a center of military activity for millennia, but to the Danviris, it was a home filled with hope and promise. Raia's parents were diplomats, and devoted their lives to brokering a peace between the lashuntas and the formians, a goal that spanned decades. They taught their daughter the value of all sentient life, for even among creatures like the insectile formians, who were so unlike lashuntas and had been enemies for so long, one can find similarities like culture, society, and civilization. But even more important are the differences. The details that separate one species from another are not only what make them interesting, but also teach one new things, and inspire one to question and re-examine one's own assumptions and beliefs.The fact that Raia's parents actually succeeded in helping to negotiate peace with the Colonies only reinforced their teachings in the young lashunta's mind. Raia became almost obsessed with alien life forms. She devoured any texts she could find that described the myriad species that inhabited the worlds beyond Castrovel, and dreamed of someday traveling among the stars and meeting new species. When she reached puberty, Raia chose to develop into the tall, intellectual damaya subspecies, following the example of her parents, both of whom are damaya.When she was old enough, Raia applied to and was accepted into one of Qabarat's famed universities. Her aptitude exams showed a talent for both technology and spellcasting, so she studied the discipline of technomancy, using experimentation to blend science and magic together. At the same time, however, she also excelled in xenobiology and xenoanthropology, applying academic rigor to her childhood passion. During this time, Raia discovered Yaraesa, the lashunta goddess of knowledge and wisdom, whose faith was more akin to the scientific method. Raia wholeheartedly embraced Yaraesa's teachings, seeking self-perfection through the acquisition of knowledge and the development of one's mind and intellect.It was also at university that Raia met Danese, an exchange student from Triaxus. Raia was immediately enthralled with the exotic ryphorian and his silky white fur, but it was Danese's quick wit and keen intellect that turned the initial attraction into something more. Danese was the first real ""alien” that Raia befriended, and their friendship eventually blossomed into love. Raia and Danese were inseparable during their time at university, but knew they would need to reassess their relationship when their studies were complete. Danese had already accepted a commission in the Skyfire Legion and had to return to Triaxus after graduation, while Raia had been accepted into a graduate program on Absalom Station. Danese offered to resign his commission, but Raia refused. In her opinion, neither of them should have to sacrifice their own advancement and improvement for the sake of the other; instead, each of them should follow Yaraesa's example and figure things out for themselves—intellectually and spiritually, as well as romantically. They bid each other a tearful farewell, and promised to reunite whenever circumstances allowed.After completing her studies, Raia realized that her passion for studying alien life-forms was actually a calling, and her technomantic abilities were the currency she could use to fund her life's work, exchanging her skills as a scientist and technomancer for berths on ships heading out to undiscovered regions of the Vast. Raia believes there is a certain nobility in contacting an alien species for the first time and working to ensure that both they and the peoples of the Pact Worlds advance and improve from the relationship. She seeks out new technology and alternative magical techniques from the aliens she encounters, trading her own knowledge in exchange. Raia doesn't hold to any unrealistic expectation of non-interference in alien cultures, but believes strongly in doing the right thing, and in always striving for honor, compassion, and justice.Despite her love of exploration, Raia remains firmly tied to the Pact Worlds. Besides her parents and friends on Castrovel, Raia still loves Danese, and the two remain committed to one another, even across the vast distances involved in interstellar travel. They stay in regular communication, and treasure the infrequent times when their paths bring them physically close to one another. Some day, they might choose to settle down and build a life together, but for now Raia is content. She knows love, her life has purpose and meaning, and the galaxy is filled with an endless number of aliens to discover, befriend, and study—one species at a time"6/9/2018 17:07:41,Quig,Ysoki,Mechanicq,"Born to a poor family barely eking out a living in the small settlement of Estuar on Akiton, Quig Dexel developed a fascination at an early age with the various water-purification plants that skirted the nearby polar ice caps.

Initially hired as a de-icer, he made sure that the storage tanks' outflow lines didn't freeze over during the cold nights. Though he worked odd hours, he was able to make friends by helping his coworkers when their shoddy flamers malfunctioned.In his spare time, Quig began constructing the first iterations of what would become his drone companion, Scout, using spare parts he scrounged from Estuar's junk heaps and alleys. One early morning after his shift, as Quig hunted for scraps that he could fashion into an actuator, he was winged by a stray laser blast from a passing firefight waged between a shobhad bounty hunter and her human quarry. Ignoring the pain, Quig dropped the hunk of metal he was holding and chased after the fracas. He arrived on the scene in time to see the bounty hunter tackle the fugitive and slap him in restraints. Flushed with adrenaline, Quig realized then and there that this was what he wanted to do for the rest of his life.That afternoon, after gathering up all of his belongings and mounting a pistol to Scout's undercarriage, Quig said farewell to his family and set off into the wider world. He eventually made his way to the bustling streets of the Hivemarket, where he signed on as a caravan guard with a group of ikeshti traders. Quig spent the first few hours of the journey questioning the lizardfolk about their society, until several pointed stares gave him the hint that he should keep to himself. He proceeded to valiantly suppress his curiosity and tinker quietly on Scout for much of the trip, pausing only when a flock of hungry norkasa swooped too close to the caravan and gave him the chance to impress the ikeshti with the improvements he'd made to his trusty de-icing flamer.The journey ended in the ancient city of Arl, a haven for blood sports in the coliseum known as the Crimson Forum. After getting paid, Quig explored the city's labyrinthine streets and was promptly ambushed by a gang of street thugs who not only took his money, but disabled and absconded with Scout. Enraged yet already streetwise enough to be suspicious of the city authorities, young Quig began asking around about other gangs or freelancers that could help him get his revenge.It was there, in one of Arl's seediest dive bars, that Quig ran into Dhareen the Vise, the same shobhad bounty hunter who inadvertently set him on his life's path. As an awestruck Quig launched into his entire life story, Dhareen sighed wearily and told him to forget about his lost drone and head back to his backwater town. But at last Quig said the four words the shobhad lived to hear:""I can pay you.""Dhareen scoffed, but as the ysoki pointed out a dozen ways she could improve her gear, the bounty hunter reluctantly agreed, and the two planned a raid of the gang's headquarters.One week later, Quig and Scout had been reunited, and the ysoki was apprenticed to Dhareen, having impressed her with his quick thinking during the rescue of his drone. Quig learned much from the gruff shobhad over the next year as they traveled the system, and though they often butted heads over methods of tracking and capturing their quarries, the two enjoyed a relationship of mutual respect. Upon the completion of a sizable job where they collected five bounties simultaneously—right under the noses of several competing bounty hunters—Dhareen announced that she was ready to retire and travel with her clan once more. Quig was saddened about the dissolution of their partnership, but also felt ready to operate on his own. The shobhad returned to Akiton to live what she hoped would be a quieter life, while Quig continues to make a name for himself across the Pact Worlds.Quig is personable and outgoing—often significantly chattier than his comrades would like—and his constant traveling for work has left him with friends and contacts across the Pact Worlds. He prides himself on being a good judge of character, and while he's savvy enough to withhold actual trust until it's been earned, he's not above throwing himself into a fight on behalf of a near-stranger if he's got a good feeling about them. Though fully capable of working alone, he tends to get bored easily without people to talk to, and thus prefers to sign on with teams of adventurers, where he can act as the group's resident tracker and starship engineer. While he still keeps in touch with his family, he doesn't speak about his hometown much, as he's a bit embarrassed by his unglamorous upbringing—when he does mention it, it is with a liberal helping of humor. He's a fan of both taking minor trophies from previous jobs and scavenging spare parts that he's positive may come in handy someday, inevitably turning his cabin or bunk into a riotous nest of cherished junk.Quig's closest companion is his drone, Scout, and he spends the majority of his downtime puttering about in the robot's systems. He often talks to Scout as way of thinking out loud or voicing his innermost thoughts, attributing them to the drone in a way that can make him seem a bit unbalanced to those who don't know him well. (And in truth, sometimes to those who do.) When he's captured a bounty and is feeling particularly mischievous, he often pretends to consult with the robot about the person's fate, ultimately claiming that he sympathizes and would like to let the target go, but ""the robot says otherwise."""6/9/2018 17:09:05,Navasi,Human,Envoy,"Born into a prominent family on Absalom Station, the envoy who calls herself Navasi spent much of her childhood avoiding her parents in their ""sky-villa,"" as they called their sprawling, six-story home in the Nyori Palisades. Navasi's mother had designs on her canny-but-headstrong daughter inheriting the family's business. Her father had visions of a queenly young woman sitting in silk among the station's most prominent socialites.Navasi wanted neither. A quip on her lips, she eschewed glitzy playdates and family soirees in favor of zipping through Absalom Station's streets with her best friends, the children of the household employees. She'd take the rush of riding a screaming hovercycle over the pompous sniggering of the wealthy any day of the week.As she befriended more and more stationers from less-privileged walks of life, Navasi's irritation with her parents and their deliberate aloofness from the rest of society turned into outright disgust. The inequities of Absalom Station, where the rich lived in fortified enclaves and the poor lived in little more than metal boxes, pained her. Simply giving away her pocket money didn't seem like enough. She began to dream of a fairy-tale life in which she could steal the affluent's unearned wealth and give it to those truly in need, and idolized the Free Captains of the Diaspora—pirates living by their own rules. Navasi could only imagine the fun she'd have with such freedom—and the good she'd do, of course.On the eve of her eighteenth birthday, Navasi sat in her plush quarters, staring at the gold-fibered holo-gown that was to be her debut dress. Two choices stood before her. She could don that false uniform, attend the gala, and accept her mother's gift of an executive position in the family company. Or she could leave.It took less than an hour for Navasi to slip out of the manor and stow away onto a ship bound for the Diaspora.Navasi arrived on Broken Rock with a pocketful of stolen credsticks and a gleam in her eye. She quickly signed up as a ""procurement specialist"" with a contracting firm called the Sixth Finger—little more than a starfaring thieves' guild—ready to use her new position to steal from exploitative corporations and make herself a hero to those in need.The reality of life in a pirate enclave hit her like a meteorite. Having quickly blown through her money, and too stubborn to return home in shame, Navasi found she no longer had a choice in which jobs she took. Under the guildrunners' threats, she roughed up innocents, stole from the less fortunate, and worse. Though she never completely lost her egalitarian beliefs, she hardly recognized the naïve idealist she'd once been. A few years in the streets showed her how much of her former life she'd taken for granted, and taught her that if she wanted to take care of others, she first needed to take care of herself. That, at least, she was good at, and she quickly gained a reputation in the gang as the best fast-talker and facewoman around, spinning bold plans and quick wits into fat paydays.Now a jaded young woman, Navasi found that the wealth from her scores brought little joy without friends to share it with, and she took comfort in the hardscrabble survivalists and secretly softhearted rogues she recruited to her crews. Yet it was in one particular woman that Navasi truly found herself again. Purple-haired and tattooed, with eyes like blue supergiants, the newcomer was outspoken against those in power. She bucked the pirates' authority and operated alone, pulling the sorts of righteous jobs Navasi had once dreamed of. She was the bravest, most exciting woman Navasi had ever met, and despite Navasi's continuing allegiance to the Sixth Finger, the two quickly became inseparable.That all came crashing down the day the Sixth Finger arranged to knock over a medship full of supplies bound for Absalom Station. To the gang's leaders, the ship's mission—aiding refugees of a wartorn star system—was inconsequential compared to the valuable drugs in its cargo bays. Navasi's objections were overruled.It was the final straw. Together, Navasi and her friend formulated a plan, alerting the medship to the imminent heist and carefully sabotaging the fighters the gang had designated for the assault. It all might have gone unnoticed, had the gang's resident technomancer not decided to check the security cams one final time. In the ensuing ambush, Navasi and her friend were pinned down, their backs to the sole spaceworthy ship—a single-seat fighter with only enough life support for one of them. Unwilling to leave her friend, Navasi prepared for them to go out in a blaze of glory—only to have her friend shove her into the cockpit and slam the canopy. As Navasi scrabbled with the latch, the other woman winked, pulled the pins on her grenades, and sprinted straight at their ambushers.The wealthy scion of Absalom Station died that day, as did the pirate she'd become. As she made her way back to Absalom Station with the medship, knowing that neither the Sixth Finger nor her spurned family would ever stop looking for her, she forsook both of her previous incarnations. Abandoning her old identity, she took the name of her fallen friend—Navasi—and swore that henceforth she'd carry on the fight they'd started together, only stealing from those who deserved it, putting her finger in the eye of anyone who thrived on exploitation, regardless of which side of the law they were on. Knowing she'd need a new appearance as well, she continued borrowing from her friend, dying her jet-black hair purple and adding a single blue contact. Yet when she considered mimicking the original Navasi's tattoos, she was shocked to learn that they were symbols of Weydan, the god of discovery and equality, famous for taking mortal form. Though her friend had never spoken of religion, Navasi took it as a sign, and even holds out some hope that perhaps her companion might have been more than she seemed, though she recognizes that such thoughts are probably just a manifestation of her grief.Today, Navasi has built a reputation—perhaps more than is truly wise for a woman with a price on her head—as a talented freelance captain, putting together crews for adventures ranging from planetary scouting and private security to her old talent for ""procurement,"" though she's careful about what sorts of jobs she and her friends take on. Navasi still believes in freedom for all, spreading the wealth, and taking plutocrats down a peg—but she also knows the value of earning credits, and takes pride in the ability to take care of herself and her crew (though she still has a sometimes inconvenient tendency to empty her pockets for those in need). As a scoundrel, a fast-talker, and a brilliant negotiator, Navasi is happiest when the chips are down and lives hang in the balance, as that's when you truly know who your friends are. Above all, she knows to always look beneath the surface, for like Navasi herself, nothing is ever quite what it seems."6/9/2018 17:11:00,Keskodai,Shirren,Mystic,"For those inducted into the faith of Pharasma, the Lady of Graves, death is not an ending, but a doorway: an entry into a new existence and way of being. The shirren Keskodai understands this transition well, and greets it with the joyful reverence it deserves—an outlook that's not always comforting to the patients in his medical bay.Keskodai grew up in the burning deserts of Fullbright, the side of tidally locked Verces that's always turned toward the sun. Though cosmopolitan, his hometown of Takoris was primarily shirren, having been an early satellite settlement of the original shirren colony on that world. The child of a priest of Hylax, the Forever Queen, Keskodai grew up steeped in the values of friendship and diplomacy, and felt a deep connection to the divine, yet chafed at the idea of serving the same god as his parent. Exactly which god he'd serve instead remained unclear, until the coming of the Gray Shakes.Believed to be the result of a biotech experiment gone wrong at the local university, the plague called the Gray Shakes burned through the city like a wildfire, turning shirrens' chitin gray, rotting off their antennae, and eating away at their telepathy and motor function, leaving them awake but unable to communicate until they finally expired. In the weeks it took the local government to find a cure, thirty percent of the city's shirren population died.In the midst of this horror, a young Keskodai first encountered priests of Pharasma, black-robed beings of all different races who'd come at news of the plague. Somberly, the Pharasmins walked among the afflicted, offering magical healing where they could and comfort to those too far gone, whispering to them of the Cycle of Souls and the new worlds that awaited them. The beauty of their ministry moved Keskodai, and he quickly joined their hospice work, leaving home to study at a temple in the Ring of Nations once the plague was safely contained.After years as an initiate, Keskodai returned home a full priest of Lady of Graves, ready to tend to his people. He quickly fell in love with two members of his congregation, a female-host couple, and the three soon joined arms in marriage. Yet as much as he loved his community and his partners, a part of him remained unsatisfied. That part of every shirren that thrills at choice and decision—making began to wonder: Had he made the right choice in coming home? In choosing a life so similar to his parent? How could he know if he wanted this when there was still so much out there that he'd never experienced? The desire to explore continued to grow, until at last, after the birth of their first son, he and his partners sat down and made a plan. He would leave and see the galaxy, taking their child with him to expose him to the same new experiences. Once the child was old enough to leave his cradle-jar, Keskodai would decide whether he'd seen enough to return in good conscience, in which case both of them be welcomed with open arms. If not, the child would return alone.In his effort to see as many worlds as possible, Keskodai took to signing on with freelance adventurers and starship crews, particularly those headed out beyond the edges of the solar system. While quite capable in combat, he prefers to act as the ship's medic, trusting that his mercenary companions will give him plenty of opportunities to employ his goddess-granted magic in patching up the broken or blessing them on their journey into the Great Beyond. The cheerful manner in which he talks about death often initially disturbs those under his care, yet anyone who spends much time with the shirren quickly learns that his even-keeled, fatalistic approach to life and death doesn't make him cavalier about it: for him, to give less than his best effort in healing his friends would be to risk them dying before their appointed time—a loss for him, and a grave failure in his duty to his goddess.As with many shirren, Keskodai is a team player, always ready to throw in to help others, and a social butterfly who loves meeting new people. A crewmate once called him “the galaxy's friendliest death priest,” and he wears the badge with pride. Though quite fond of option bars and other artificial means of stimulating his choice centers, he's careful not to let himself overindulge… usually. More often he satisfies his need for independence by customizing his gear—though he doesn't consider himself vain, Keskodai is intensely proud of the aesthetics of his gear, his collection of trophies, and his mustache (which he thinks lends him an air of gravitas). His greatest pride, however, is his son Chkoresk, still in his larval stage. Like many shirren parents, Keskodai constantly carries Chkoresk—affectionately nicknamed “Chk Chk”—around in a heavily fortified cradle-jar designed to let Chk Chk learn about the world from relative safety. While Chk Chk isn't old enough to speak yet, his telepathy only good enough to grant brief blasts of childlike emotion, Keskodai holds conversations with him regularly, with Chk Chk tapping on the glass to communicate his answers.Though Keskodai is generally as easygoing as he appears, he still has his demons. The Gray Shakes tragedy left him deeply distrustful of certain types of research and technology, and he's constantly torn between his faith in individual freedom and his desire to protect the community through heavy government regulation. Worse, he's come to love the life of a wanderer and the friends he's made along the way, and deeply fears the day when Chk Chk grows old enough to return home, and Keskodai has to choose whether to head back to Verces with him, or continue on alone."6/9/2018 17:12:18,Iseph,Android,Operative,"As biomechanical entities, androids can theoretically live forever with the proper repairs. While some embrace this form of immortality, most androids live what they feel is a full life—usually around a hundred years—and then voluntarily instigate a process called renewal, in which the android's soul leaves its body, allowing a fresh android soul to inhabit it. Most people consider this a joyous occasion, metaphorically equivalent to the old android giving birth to a child, and understand that a post-renewal android is an entirely new person who just happens to inhabit the same body. Yet not all people are willing to honor this change or forgive past debts and slights, and such is the case with Iseph.Iseph awoke in an abandoned storage facility on the machine world of Aballon, standing upright in a black-market renewal crèche. Around them, the place was completely empty, save for a note and a pen left in the center of the concrete floor. Clearly hastily scrawled, the note read only: Run. Hide. Retaliate. Beware the mark. Next to the words was a drawing of a symbol—the same inexplicable design branded on Iseph's chest. Yet the biggest shock was when Iseph picked up the pen, as the note's writer had clearly intended—for the handwriting on the note matched Iseph's own.Confused and disoriented, with only some basic downloaded knowledge of the world they'd just been born into, Iseph did as the note instructed, doing their best to disappear into Aballon's bustling android population. It was here that, among other things, they first met other androids and discovered that some identified with particular genders, though Iseph never felt any such personal connection. But the questions raised by the note continued to plague them. Who had worn their body before them? Who were they running from, and why? What was the mysterious symbol? Eventually, Iseph worked up the courage to begin making surreptitious inquiries into the planet's infosphere. All of these searches failed, yet in curious ways, as if the information was being actively scrubbed and redacted. Worse, Iseph began to get the sense of being watched, faces in the crowds that seemed strangely familiar. After a month of tentative forays into they city's silicon underworld, Iseph at last tracked down someone who claimed to recognize the mark, but who insisted on meeting in person at a nearby virus bar.Iseph was almost to the tavern when it exploded in a massive fireball, the blast consuming an entire city block.Thoroughly spooked, Iseph fled Aballon, taking passage on a ship to the Diaspora. Yet as they worked there, quickly finding themself a deft hand at piloting rock-hopper shuttles and mining tugs, Iseph's fear turned to anger. Wider Pact Worlds society proved far messier than Aballon's orderly machine culture, and Iseph was first confused and then disgusted by the prejudice and jealousy androids still encountered from some humans. They met android escapees from illegal colonies in the Vast, bearing blatant symbols of corporate ownership and scars from cruel disciplinary implants, and began to suspect what their own mark might say about their origins. Incensed, Iseph made contact with the Android Abolitionist Front, learning to fly more combat-oriented craft, to sneak through the shadows, and to put down the enemies of their people with ruthless efficiency. Under the AAF's guidance, Iseph became a black ops expert, until a disagreement with their handler over a messy job led them to go independent. Today, Iseph officially hires on with freelancer crews as an elite pilot specializing in dangerous transport or exploratory missions—and if those jobs sometimes require a little infiltration or a bullet from the shadows, well, that costs extra.Though paranoia over being hunted by their mysterious enemy (as well as friends of former assassination targets) makes Iseph something of a loner, the android desperately craves companionship, and is fiercely loyal to those few who prove themselves trustworthy. As a result of their early days on Aballon and personal experience as an android in a largely biological society, Iseph questions or rejects many aspects of mainstream Pact Worlds culture, and enjoys exploring the countercultures on different worlds. Iseph believes the ends often justify the means, yet strives to only take on jobs that fit with their sense of morality. An initial focus on android rights has broadened into a tendency to identify with oppressed people and underdogs everywhere, no matter how alien, and to hate any form of slavery with a passion. While Iseph finds the most joy in flying any manner of ship or vehicle—usually too fast and recklessly for the comfort of their passengers—their infiltration abilities remain as sharp as they ever were, and the former assassin has no objections to pulling out their trusty sniper rifle again when the cause is just."6/9/2018 17:16:58,Altronus,Kasatha,Solarian,"Altronus Barasul Dovenayan was born into House Holdare, a traditional and respected family on the kasatha generation-ship-turned-homeworld Idari. The Holdare trace their lineage to Great Families already well respected when the Idari left Kasath for their centuries-long trip to the Pact Worlds, and have maintained strong connections with both the houses that rose to prominence on the ship while crew functions were paramount, and younger houses risen to prominence since the Idari became an enormous space station. Much of the influence of House Holdare comes from their renown for producing skilled adata—scholar-priests who oversee the removal and preservation of thin slices of the brains of deceased kasatha in technomagical temples called adats. Even in times when ships officers, pilots, and navigators find their social relevance waning, the adata remain highly respected in kasatha society.The eldest living member of House Holdare, Barasul Naedarin Allar of Clan Allar, Keeper of Ten Million Thoughts and doyen of the ship's adata, took a special interest in Altronus shortly after his birth, though he was but a distant nephew to her. Of course the attention of so great a clan elder comes with more responsibility and expectation than comfort, and though Altronus was raised with significant prestige and resources as a youth, he was also pushed to begin adata training very early, his family even going so far as to name him after famous adata doyens.While Altronus did not excel at his studies the way his family had hoped, neither did he do poorly, and most people chalked his merely adequate results up to his relative youth. In truth, Altronus was indeed an excellent scholar, simply one who had trouble focusing on a single topic for long. Inevitably, some interesting fact in his studies would pique his interest and draw his research off into unrelated sidetracks. This broad, self-directed education made him adept at making connections between disparate fields, yet earned him little love from traditionalist teachers who saw his scattered studies as a failure to focus and a deliberate rejection of tried-and-true scholarly practices.Though his close family were dedicated worshipers of Talavet, the Storyteller deity, one of Altronus's more sympathetic teachers felt his wandering focus could be better brought into line with training in the philosophy of the Cycle, which teaches that existence is an endless, connected series of events as stars are born, die, and born again. Though the Cycle is the guiding philosophy of the solarians, contemplative warriors with a tradition stretching far back into the history of Kasath, it's also seen as a useful tool for training body and mind in preparation for the rigors of other vocations.Altronus was accepted as a student into a prestigious cosmonastery on the Idari, and taught to focus his thoughts on the forces of the universe around him, to draw strength and guidance from the endless repetition of celestial creation and destruction. He took to the training immediately, and soon was among the most advanced students, most of whom sought not just to understand the lessons of the Cycle, but to embody them in the path of the solarian. Altronus, however, was still slated for a career as an adata. This preordained path didn't bother him—as he approached adulthood and the yearlong ritual walkabout of the Tempering, he was allowed to take on guard shifts at the ship's famed Sholar Adat. There he watched over rooms of stasis pods where adata connected to the Sensorium, the technomagical temple archive where flashes of memories from archived kasatha brains could be experienced, sorted, and analyzed. On rare occasions, he was even allowed to experience ancient Sensorium memories himself, and it was these glimpses of lives and secrets long lost that most drove Altronus to complete his studies and become a full adata.During one of his last scheduled shifts as an adata student, Altronus was assigned to an inactive Sensorium access node—one rarely used, but like all Sensorium access points still important enough to be protected by force fields and a round-the-clock guard. Though most such shifts were uneventful, on that night Altronus was surprised by the appearance of a fully cloaked and apparently rushed senior adata, Remura Esolla Kaiban of Clan Senthen, flashing a warrant to allow unscheduled access to the memory of a recently deceased citizen. Thanks to his tendency to collect trivia, Altronus knew Remura was scheduled to be giving a lecture at the far end of the Idari. What, he wondered, could be of such great importance that the revered adat would end the lecture early, not to mention need an emergency Sensorium warrant?Altronus knew he should mind his own business, but again curiosity overrode his training. Altronus contacted a friend at the far end of the ship, who informed him that not only had Adata Kaiban not left the lecture early—she was still on the stage.Immediately Altronus sounded an intruder alert, and rushed into the Sensorium access node to confront the false adata. To his surprise, Altronus discovered not a kasatha, but a small, sickly gray humanoid standing in a pile of robes and strange machinery, with long wires and humming crystals latched onto the Sensorium feed and hundreds of images flashing from the access node to the gray creature's alien devices. Altronus leapt to activate the Sensorium emergency disconnect, but the bulbous creature struck him with a taclash, ripping the pulsecaster from his grip, then shot him with a pistol that fired a searing green ray. Through the resulting haze of pain, Altronus managed to seal the access node's security force fields, trapping himself and the gray intruder inside.With a shock, Altronus realized the severity of the situation. Any response to his alarm would take precious moments to arrive, and still more to disable the force field. Unarmed, Altronus had little chance of holding the intruder at bay. He had no way of healing the wound from the creature's pistol. For the first time in his life, Altronus truly confronted the fact that he was going to die. Like the stars themselves, he too would be extinguished, his body breaking down and eventually being reincorporated over millennia into new entities, new worlds, new stars. At last, he truly understood the Cycle. With his final moments, he reached out to the universe, embracing it.And the universe answered.Altronus was as surprised as the strange gray alien to find a long, shining golden blade suddenly sprouting from his lower right forearm. Yet he had seen enough of solarian training to recognize the blade of stellar energy for what it was, and leapt to put it to use, placing himself between the creature and the node's access panels. The two fought in grim silence, and though it was clear the gray invader was the more skilled, Altronus stood his ground, putting to use every scrap of training he'd gained. He didn't need to win—only buy time, keeping the creature from finishing its infiltration of the Sensorium until help arrived.Blow after blow fell upon Altronus, and the pistol's strange green rays continued to singe and scale his flesh, but Altronus would not fall. His blade scored many fewer hits, and at times seemed to pass cleanly through his foe to no effect, but he pressed the attack as best he could. As he did, a fierce joy welled up in him, a sense of the rightness of the path that had led him to this moment. This cosmic contentment continued to expand until he had no choice but to release it, unleashing a burst of searing stellar flame in all direction.At last, ship security arrived, using their command bypasses to deactivate the access node's force fields and dragging the half-dead Altronus from the fight. Yet upon seeing that it was outnumbered, the bulbous-headed alien didn't continue to fight, or attempt to escape. Rather, it paused to take stock of the situation, toggled a device on its arm—and detonated its own head like a bomb.The security team secured the body and questioned Altronus. When several true adata arrived, they immediately attempted to preserve part of the horrid gray thing's exploded brain. While their efforts to pull meaning from the splatter were greatly hindered, two ideas were recovered. The first was that gray spies had deeply infiltrated the Pact Worlds. The second was that the time of something important called ""Phase Three"" was coming soon.The Doyenate of the Idari was informed, and additional security added to Sensorium access nodes. While the matter of gray infiltrators was officially left open to investigation, with no more solid leads and no further incidents, official attention quickly turned elsewhere.But Altronus couldn't let the issue lie.Questions filled his mind. How thoroughly had grays infiltrated the Pact Worlds? Had they successfully infiltrated the Idari? What did this gray seek to learn from the Sensorium? Why had it sought to destroy its own brain when capture became inevitable? And, most importantly, what was Phase Three, and how soon would it arrive? Altronus tried to quiet his mind with further solarian training, but while his powers grew, his sense of calm did not.As it came time for Altronus to begin his Tempering, he realized he could never accept a role as an adata while the mystery of the gray invader hung over him. He sought, and received, approval from his house doyen to abandon the path he had long trod, and informed his family that he was leaving the Idari. He had no firm idea of where he would go, nor how his investigation would advance, only a vow to chase down every strange occurrence that might mark a potential gray incursion within the Pact Worlds. While many of these events had other—sometimes equally strange—explanations, he found enough potential connections to the grays to support his growing suspicion that secret conspiracies indeed existed just out of sight. Still a rigorous scholar, he began to accept that he'd need to give more credence to outrageous claims and unlikely stories if he ever wanted to uncover the truth.Now inarguably an adult, Altronus has nevertheless remained on his Tempering for much longer than the traditional year, and still sees himself as working to form the traditions that will guide him through his later life. He often signs on with freelancers and adventuring companies as a guard, scout, or researcher in order to support himself—especially if their activities align with his obsession—yet his primary goal always remains researching the shadowy web of plots he first glimpsed that night in the access node.

Unexplained attacks on the livestock were occurring with increasing frequency and viciousness. If the trend continued, the winter would be a difficult one.

Still, she kept watch by her window, working on a leather pouch to keep awake. Suddenly, she caught sight of a movement in the shadows far across the property. It slunk towards the barn, but Emrik didn’t react; he had his back to it and hadn’t seen it yet. Unthinking, the girl ran out of the house and raced toward him, slipping on the muddy earth. She watched the two figures struggle; one fell, the other atop him. Instinctively, she grasped the tools in her nightshift’s pocket as she reached the pair. Screaming, she plunged them into the beast’s side. It reared back and stumbled away before collapsing.As she embraced her brother’s fading form, a wave of calm rushed over her.

By the age of 25, Pyotr had already taken an apprentice, a young man by the name of Oskar Tazik. Pyotr was truly a man of science.	One day, when Pyotr was 36, he had been working on a particularly volatile substance, when the mixture exploded, severely and permanently burning Pyotr, and killing Oskar. Pyotr’s father, not wanting to draw attention to an incident of manslaughter involving the son of a baron, made sure to sweep the entire event under the rug, and had Pyotr quietly put into prison. His mother had already passed away by this point. Despite the severity of the burns covering Pyotr’s upper body, he received only minimal medical help before being detained. Pyotr would spend the next 5 years in the prison, and in that time, he became acquainted with a man named Sergei. Sergei was an old medicine-man who was imprisoned for a reason Pyotr never discovered. Sergei showed Pyotr how to cope with the constant pain of such burns, as well as how to care for them.

Mikhael decided that instead of keeping Pyotr imprisoned, he would have him banished from Eldishfir. Pyotr, while still altogether unhappy from the events of the past several years, experienced an increase in mood when he realized he would have the chance to travel the world, and especially that through this exile, he would be able to escape the confines of the prison, which functioned as a physical barrier between himself and his ability to invent. Having been banished from his homeland, and not very inclined to return, he decided to cast aside his real surname of Djokorov, and dubbed himself Pyotr Draguvarik. He is determined to live a new life, one rich with creativity, though he carries with him a reminder of what happened to cause all of this, both in the form of Oskar’s original application and in his nightmares.

He learned music and magic from his mother. However, normally, half-elves are not allowed on Evermeet; he was only permitted to stay because he was born there.

Raised in a large circle of both close and extended family, Nathanial learned how to hunt and track early in his life and spent many days tracking game through the woods, bringing back valuable pelts and meat for his family, both to use and to sell in the local market. There were also times where he and his family would be called upon to help protect their local village from outward threats.Once affluent, the Dahora family line have long since forsaken the trappings of court and intrigue, but are still in possession of secrets arts that were once their claim to high status. One and perhaps the greatest of these artifacts, fell into Nathanial's hands one fateful day, a mysterious and ancient tome known simply as the Monstrous Arcanum  which was supposedly penned and bound by Fey nobility in exchange for a service provided long ago. Within it's vellum pages is kept the knowledge of all manner of beasts and monstrous creatures that inhabit the Material plane and it was from this tome that Nathanial, somehow, received his latent abilities which have yet to fully manifest and are very much beyond his current understanding.If, for some reason, this character concept does not mesh with the current party, I will be happy to craft something that will fit better.

She had a perfectly normal happy childhood until they had some friends over for dinner, Klaus Reinland and Olaf Mueller. As they made a toast of wine as drank, the Conrads quickly fell asleep. The next night they woke up to firelight, staring at a crowd of cloaked individuals, known as the Order of Judgement. They charged the Conrads of tainting the earth with their foul presence. The punishments would be lashings and death. Bruno and Edmund were the first to be lashed with silver whips. Then it was Klara's turn. She never knew such pain existed, when the pain stopped, and she fell from her restraints. She looked to the parents who saved her before they each took several crossbow bolts to the chest. Suddenly Klara's vision turned red, and then she looked down in horror at the remaining members of the order, clawed to shreds. Knowing that they were no longer safe, she and her brothers went on the run, moving from town to town. Then, one full moon, Klara experienced excruciating pain before blacking out. She and brothers woke up in the woods with torn clothes and bloodstained mouths. Finally they knew, before a couple weeks later, when they befriended a blood hunter named Marwin Wellmark, who told them they had powerful and dangerous blood, and taught them to harness it to protect themselves from the monsters that were hunting them.

As always he has the same dream of the night which set him on his path. Originally an only child victimised by his peers Baridius spent his early years learning to talk his way out of trouble rather than to fight through it as he grew older this ability proved more and more necessary, for cheating drunks out of their money was rarely hazard free. As always the dream starts at the Splendiferous Unicorn a rather fancy tavern for the likes of Baridius with an entrance fee to match, it had taken several months for him to scavenge the money in cheated chance games and stolen pocket change but at last here he sat on a fine leather seat in a darkened corner reviewing the marks that lay before him. As he waits looking for the right target a darkened hair drow woman enters the establishment accompanied by a muscular half orc dressed in fine leather clothes. Baridus observes the woman move from game to game, collecting more and more winnings, as she travels through the tavern. Most importantly he notices that every game she plays at she offers no bet and mutters only a few words to her opponent at the beginning of the game before falling into silence until her victory. Interest peaked Baridius approaches.Placing his trusted weighted dice on the table Baridus smiles at the woman mustering all of his charm “I must admit I’m interested in your coin but notice you have yet to bet anytime” the drow meets his gaze “quite the contrary best me and I shall grant you your heart’s desire.” While normally a man highly resistant to false promises, after making so many himself, there was something about this particular offer that consumed Baridius sitting at the table he and the drow rolled their die and as his weighted luck would have it Baridius emerged the winner, however in his greed he had forgotten the first rule of conning, always let the loser feel like they have won. The drow smiled placed a kiss on Baridius’ cheek and departed from the tavern. Always at the kiss Baridius wakes startled but that night was only the beginning of his tale, as the days went on Baridius noticed stranger and stranger occurrences around him, flames would burst into life or ebb into darkness as he passed by, earth and dirt would sometimes ripple like water when he stood upon it and people whom once hated seemed more content within his presence. At first this came as a blessing, these small benefits, it was not until the next bar brawl when everything changed, using his new found powers Baridius attempted to subdue his opponent when something went horribly wrong. An uncontrollable cascade of fire erupted over Baridius’ head engulfing all within the tavern, including himself, in flame, to this day Baridius does not know how he survived this, but he did and woke up charred, burned and coughing up ash hours later in the broken wreckage of the tavern. Now fleeing from his past, and seeking redemption, Baridius roams the world searching for the drow and the answers that she may hold."7/2/2018 20:10:29,Danori Dalanthan,Eladrin,Paladin,"Danori hails from Alyfhil, the captial of Eiladronya. There, she grew up in the noble Dalanthan family, where she spent her formative years studying the world and it's people through books. Of all the accounts she read, she found that the elves, and most notably the Eladrin, were superior. She also trained in combat, becoming a prodigious swordsman. Through the dicipline instilled in her through her study and training, Danori was well on her way to becoming a notable official in Alyfhil.With just weeks to go until an important test of her knowledge to further her career, Danori was studying in one of the libraries of Alyfhil. Her eyes crossed to a book about the Gods of Aefdron, and she decided it might be interesting to read. She flipped open the book to a page right in the middle, and she recieved a vision.Divunquil, a half-elven god of peace, called out to her. He requested she aid him in reuniting the elves of the continent with the humans. Currently, the races were seperated by a bitter history of war. He told Danori that she must do all in her power to unify them.Danori found herself inspired. A god had given her a great task, and she knew she must make the effort to achieve it. Using her rising position and upcoming examination, Danori went to the leaders of Alyfhil. She told them Divunquil's message and asked for their assistance in achieving his goals. Put nicely, Danori was laughed out of the room. She had doomed her political career. What self-respecting Eladrin would willing associate with the humans? The humans were barbaric, they said.Danori had seen the truth, though. She believed in Divunquil's word. Danori went to her elders, the leaders of the Dalanthan family, hoping that perhaps they would support her in her cause.She told them of her encounter with the leaders of Alyfhil. She explained her case, and she told them of Divunquil's message. Her elders were furious. Danori had suggested they reconcile with the humans in front of the leaders of their city? She had made a disgrace of the Dalanthan family. She was promptly disowned and turned away for her radical ideas.Danori did not feel dismayed. She had been contacted by a God. She had a duty to fulfill. Perhaps Eiladronya was not as welcoming to her ideas as she would have liked. No matter, perhaps she must spread the word of Divunquil's goals elsewhere! Danori rounded up her gear and prepared to set out, bringing stories of Divunquil and of unity between the elves and humans with her. Despite the challenges she faces, Danori Dalanthan knows her faith will not be shaken.Danori has spent the last few decades making her way south from Eiladronya towards Lothgard, where she hopes to make allies with human leaders that can help her in her quest at forging better relations between the humans and the elves. On her way, she spreads the word of Divunquil to those who will listen.A few decades into her journey, while passing though the DMSP, Danori met a dwarven man who seemed to be looking to turn his life around. He stuck around her, saying he was helping keep her out of trouble. He's been a wonderful companion to Danori over the past few months as they made their way down to Lothgard. She's very happy to have his company.Danori sees herself as a representative for Alyfhil and for Divunquil. She tries to set an example for what the relationship between the two races could be through her interactions with the humans."7/12/2018 15:26:00,Tesh Tara,Half-elf,Paladin,"On the sunny plains to the South lies a small rural village named Giprol, where the Aimar and Tardin Tara own a modest Chocobo™ farm.

Somewhere deep beneath the hopelessness she found a hidden resolve; she would throw every last ounce of energy in her eight-year-old body into finding him.Random passersbys were conscripted into a search party to comb the town; just before the sun passed below the horizon, a shout went up from Cassowary Hill; Mr. Sniggles was found! He had hurt his leg climbing through a fence and was stuck.Tesh cried with joy as she hugged Sniggles, and the town gathered in impromptu celebration.  Belatedly, she noticed that from their elevated position they could see a group of figures traveling across the plains in the distance.  “Daddy, who’re they?” Her father Tardin explained how the nearby settlement of Elves was marching to war against their ancient enemies, the Drow.It took several more questions before she understood, with dawning horror, what he meant.  “You mean... people hurt each other... On purpose?!?”  Tesh was clearly about to cry again, so Tardin rushed to hug her, but was instead startled when her mood swung with a shout.“I won’t let the Mr. Sniggles’ of the world be hurt by jerky old fences.  I promise to... teach them all to have fun, instead of being mean!”Tardin Tara smiled in pride at his little girl... then rushed after her when he realized she was making a beeline for the Elves right now.  “Wait, no, you have to grow up first!”Seventeen years later, she was ready.Digestible Bullet Points and extra details*Can't get over how wonderful and Fun life is.

So far he has claimed to have worked as a sailor, thief, seamstress (""The hardest part was NOT pretending to be female. Don't ask...""), knight (it did not last for long), and hunter. He also claims to have slain a three-headed wolf, almost been eaten by hungry priests, and got engaged to a nobleman's daughter on accident due to ""a very peculiar misspelling of my name, and way too much booze on the dragon's part"".Most people doubt all of  these stories are true, if any.

Upon touching it, Pebble felt a surge of power flow through her. She took it with her, and in the following days and weeks realised she could do new things, like conjuring a magical hand to reach higher places or making light entirely without fire. With no other dwarves around her, she decided to leave her beloved mountains behind and venture out into the open world in search of information about her new abilities and if they were really connected to the egg she found.Her solitary life made her a lady of few words and a rather grumpy nature, except when she gets the chance to do research about magic.

For the 20 years in which he has struggled to carve out a new life in Faerûn, Dave has very little to show but the belongings he carries with him.  The only way he has managed to carve out a living is as travelling accountant, but has recently begun using the gifts given him by THE FIEND to take on more mercenary work to make ends meet.  He uses the knowledge from the religious studies in first 9 years of his life, along with his natural charm and deception, to garner support from all religions, before swiftly moving on before being noticed.Desperately trying to retain a facade of normality, Dave struggles to separate his own thoughts from those of THE FIEND, and as he becomes a more powerful warlock, he only loses more of himself."8/18/2018 10:13:29,Balroth Asterion,Minotaur,Paladin,"Previously the owner/operator of a semi-successful tavern 'The Hearth and Horn', Balroth was forced into a career change after a group of thugs attempted to rob him one night as he closed up.

Goodbarrel ales are quite well-regarded in certain parts of Varisia, and many halfling settlements have a Goodbarrel pub founded by some offshoot of the family.Lem’s parents were (and are) the owners of one such pub, a business which left them comfortably well-off, at least by halfling standards, but not rich. Lem grew up surrounded by the bustling warmth of the inn, occasionally helping his parents with the work, but more usually slipping away to ingratiate himself with the patrons. Visitors from out of town would often find a small halfling-child sidling onto their laps and demanding stories of the wider world, and if ever a bard came to perform at the tavern, the boy Lem would sit enraptured at their feet for hours.As Lem grew up, his fascination with these stories did not fade. He declared to his parents that he wanted to leave their small town and become a hero. His parents, bemused, finally agreed to send him to a school in the city – somewhere he could study magic, learn to wield a sword, and hopefully realise that the hero business wasn’t as exciting as the tales made it sound. Surely, once the novelty wore off and their flighty son was left with hard work and dry study, he’d get bored and come home.This part did not turn out quite as they envisaged.Now, there was another boy at Lem’s school who liked to talk about becoming a hero. His name was Calenhad, and he seemed to be everything a hero of legend should be. A half-elf embraced by both cultures, exceptionally handsome, and born at an auspicious moment in history, the perihelion of a great comet. Calenhad had a Destiny, a destiny that dwelt in his very blood, and luck smiled upon him as a result… or at least, that was what he told everyone.Calenhad was also lazy, content to coast on his luck rather than putting any work in. He spent the majority of his time preening, boasting and flirting. Lem looked at this, and thought, “This man does not deserve to be the hero.”Lem thought, “They say fortune favours the bold.”Lem thought, “I will make fortune notice me.”The first step, Lem decided, was to have a distinctive weapon. Calenhad owned a beautiful sword, an elven curve blade he’d inherited from his father. This seemed, in general, like a reasonable way to acquire a weapon, but since Lem’s own parents were unlikely to bequeath him anything more offensive than a corkscrew, he’d have to try a different approach.A few days later, Lem marched himself down to the local blacksmith, where he deposited a bag of gold and a torn-out library book page detailing a very particular type of sword. All size measurements on the page had been scribbled over, and Lem had added his own annotations to the diagrams, specifying the dimensions a halfling wielder would require.Lem named the sword Pin, both for its shape and for the fact that he intended to use it to puncture Calenhad’s ego. (Calenhad’s sword had a name too, of course – an ancient elvish name that roughly translated to “banisher of darkness”. Lem preferred “Pin”.) He practiced with Pin until he had a feel for the sword, then he sought out Calenhad and challenged him to a duel.Calenhad laughed at the presumptuous little halfling and accepted, assuming it would be an easy fight. But while Calenhad had been resting on the laurels he hadn’t actually earned yet, Lem had been training and becoming a skilled swordsman. As for Calenhad’s luck: halflings are lucky too. Lem dealt more hits than he took, and eventually Calenhad was forced to yield.After this event, Lem found that his own luck seemed to expand, and become something he could exercise a degree of conscious control over. Whether it was because Calenhad yielded to him, because his blood mingled with Lem’s during the fight, or just because the challenge had indeed been bold enough to win Fortune’s notice, destiny seemed to turn its favour to Lem. This, of course, only cemented his determination to prove himself worthy.Upon leaving school, Lem set out to hunt monsters, armed with Pin and equipped with adventuring gear bought for him by his parents, who’d finally accepted that their son was going to go gallivanting off in the wider world, and decided that the least they could do was make sure he was well-provisioned. Lem generally doesn’t talk about this parental support – heroes are supposed to be self-sufficient, after all – and it’s with a slight sense of guilty embarrassment that he returns to his parents’ inn twice a year, on each of their birthdays.On his last such visit, his mother presented him with an assignment: his uncle’s brewery had received a large order for the upcoming festival in Sandpoint, and wanted a few extra hands to help deliver the ale. Lem was tasked with taking one of the inn ponies, William, to pull the caravans, and accompanying them as far as Sandpoint. He dragged his feet a little on this request (hauling ale is not a particularly heroic activity), but eventually acquiesced – partly because his mother offered to let him keep William after the ale had been safely delivered, but mostly out of the sense of indebtedness he still feels towards his family for all they’ve done to help him reach this point."8/23/2018 3:49:36,Tama Nitama,Tabaxi,Artificer,archeologist8/24/2018 19:54:21,Mila Tealeaf,Halfling,Cleric,"Mila was the daughter of a pair of halfling merchants.
